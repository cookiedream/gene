            "Question: The mechanism by which vitamin A prevents or delays in chemical carcinogenesis remains unclear. In the present study, we assess the suggestive role of vitamin A in the initiation phase of carcinogenesis. We have conducted a dose-effect relationship between vitamin A dietary intake and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) genotoxicity measured both in vitro and in vivo. Thus AFB1-induced mutagenesis in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was investigated and compared to AFB1-induced single-strand breaks (SSBs) in DNA of rat hepatocytes. Rats were fed ad libitum with diet containing 0, 5, 50 or 500 IU of retinyl palmitate for 8 weeks. The AFB1-treated rats were injected i.p. with 1 mg/kg body weight. In the Ames test conditions TA98 back-reversion was negatively correlated with the log of vitamin A concentration in liver S9 fractions from experimental groups. However, the activities of metabolizing enzymes which specifically activate or deactivate AFB1 were found to be significantly decreased in vitamin A-deficient animals and weakly modified in vitamin A-supplemented animals. For in vivo experiments, the DNA elution rate of both AFB1-treated and untreated rats was increased in vitamin A deficiency condition (+79% and +17% respectively) and was reduced with the higher vitamin A dietary level (-44% and -53% respectively). DNA damage measured in vivo showed a significant positive correlation with mutagenic activity measured in the Ames test. These results confirm that the vitamin A status of animals can influence AFB1 genotoxic activity in vitro and indicate that this phenomenon also occurs in vivo. Thus a similar mechanism may be considered for the protective action of vitamin A both in vitro and in vivo. However, this mechanism is unlikely to involve modulation of the microsomal enzyme system responsible for AFB1 metabolism. Therefore a protective mechanism at the cytosolic or nuclear levels may be suggested., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Formaldehyde was examined for bacterial mutagenicity using Escherichia coli WP2(pKM101) and WP2uvrA(pKM101), and Salmonella typhimurium TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98, TA100 and TA102, in the absence of any exogenous source of metabolic activation. Using pre-incubation exposure, clear mutagenicity was seen for TA98, TA100 and TA102, and both E. coli strains. In standard plate-incorporation assays, consistent mutagenicity was seen only for TA100 and WP2uvrA(pKM101). No evidence of mutagenicity was seen for TA1535, TA1537 or TA1538 using either method of exposure. These data confirm the enhanced ability of the pre-incubation method to detect the mutagenicity of formaldehyde both quantitatively, as expressed by numbers of revertant colonies, and qualitatively, in terms of the range of indicator strains reverted. The relatively greater sensitivity of the pre-incubation assay is probably due to better containment of a volatile agent and/or lack of interaction with agar during the initial period of exposure. The findings are consistent with the suggestion that formaldehyde induces lesions in bacteria which are, at least to some extent, excision-repairable, and indicate that the presence of the R-factor plasmid may be required for the expression of its mutagenicity in excision repair-deficient Salmonella., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The S9 phenobarbital-induced preparations from Albino rats and 6 strains of inbred and outbred Pzh: SFISS mice were tested by an Ames test for their ability to metabolize the two promutagens 2-aminofluorene (2AF) and cyclophosphamide (CP), and to influence the mutagenic activity of the two directly acting mutagens methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). 2AF showed a mutagenic activity after incubation with all kinds of microsomal preparations. S9 from B10. mice (Ah+Ah+) was twice as active as that from D2.BN mice (Ah- Ah-). CP was mutagenic exclusively in the presence of S9 from Pzh: SFISS or B10. mice and from rats. Neither fraction deactivated significantly the mutagenicity of MMS. Microsomal preparations from Albino rats and outbred mice were most active in deactivating the mutagenicity of MNNG., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The mutagenicity of 24 benzyl derivatives, containing a variety of substituents and leaving groups, were assayed in strain TA100 using the Ames plate-incorporation assay. p-Nitrobenzyl chloride (12 000 revertants/mumole), p-nitrobenzyl tosylate (6100 revertants/mumole), and p-acetoxybenzyl chloride (100 revertants/mumole) were mutagenic; none of the remaining 21 compounds were mutagenic. p-Nitrobenzyl chloride was also found to be mutagenic in strain TA98 (700 revertants/mumole), but not in strain TA98NR (a strain deficient in nitro reductase activity). p-Acetoxybenzyl chloride was nonenzymatically hydrolyzed to p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol and p-acetoxybenzyl alcohol. These findings suggest that nitrobenzyl derivatives were mutagenic due to nitro reductive metabolism and that p-acetoxybenzyl chloride was mutagenic due to the intermediate formation of p-hydroxybenzyl chloride during the hydrolysis of p-acetoxybenzyl chloride., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The nitroimidazole-thiadiazole derivative CL 64855 (2-amino-5 (1-methyl-5-nitro-2-imidazolyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole), a potent antimicrobial agent with curative action against Trypanosoma cruzi, was assayed in the Salmonella/microsome test. CL 64855 proved to be a potent mutagen to the frameshift indicator tester strains TA98 and TA102. No activity was observed with the base-pair substitution mutagen indicator strain TA100 in spot tests. No significant increase in the number of induced mutants could be detected in the presence of rat-liver microsome fraction. The excision-repair-deficient strain TA98 was much more sensitive to the killing action of CL 64855 than TA102, a repair-proficient strain. Possible differences among the mutagenic effects of CL 64855 and those observed with other anti-trypanosomal drugs are discussed., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: There is currently limited knowledge regarding the impact of different cigarette designs on the toxicological properties of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC). This study used the Salmonella Mutagenicity Assay to examine the mutagenic activity of mainstream CSCs from 11 commercial Canadian cigarette brands with different design features or tobacco blend. The brands were selected to include design features that are common for cigarettes sold in the Canadian market, as well as cigarettes with alternate filters (charcoal or MicroBlue™), the super slim design, and cigarettes containing mixed blends of different tobacco types. CSCs were obtained using the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Health Canada Intense (HCI) smoking regimes, and mutagenic activity was assessed using Salmonella strains TA98, YG1041 and YG5185. Comparisons of the commercial brands to the Kentucky 3R4F, the Canadian Monitor 8 reference and a Canadian best seller revealed no significant reduction in CSC mutagenicity for cigarettes with alternate filters. However, the super slim design did afford some reduction in mutagenic potency. Nevertheless, since the study did not attempt to evaluate the impact of the cigarette designs on human health at the individual or population level, the super slim cigarettes cannot be considered 'reduced-harm' cigarettes. , Yes: 0.99, No: 0.01\n",
            "Question: The essential oils of Citrus sinensis and Citrus latifolia showed antimycotic activity against Candida spp. isolated from the oral cavity; they are neither mutagenic on the Ames test nor cytotoxic. Their main components are R-(+)-limonene, β-thujene, α-myrcene and γ-terpinene. The aim of this work was to evaluate their antimutagenic and antioxidant capacities. Antimutagenic properties were evaluated against MNNG and ENNG on S. typhimurium TA100; against 2AA on strain TA98 and in front of 4NQO and NOR on strain TA102. Both were antimutagenic against MNNG (p < 0.001) but only C. latifolia was antimutagenic against ENNG (p < 0.001). Both presented antimutagenic activity against 2AA (p < 0.001). They were antioxidant against the ROS-generating compound 4NQO (p < 0.001) and the antibiotic NOR (p < 0.001). In the antioxidant evaluation, the activity in DPPH assay was in a range of 6-23% for C. sinensis and of 22-71% for C. latifolia. Both were antioxidant compared with BHT in β-carotene bleaching assay and were able to decreased apoptosis in HaCat cells stimulated with H 2 O 2 . The levels of intracellular superoxide ion were lower in the presence of both oils. In conclusion, the essential oils of C. sinensis and C. latifolia are antimutagenic against at least three types of mutagens and have antioxidants properties., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Aside from the considerable number of reports on the physical and chemical properties of dental bonding agents, information concerning their biologic effects is sparse. Three dentin bonding agents (Prisma Universal Bond, Pertac Universal Bond, and Syntac) and the ingredients methylmethacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate, and glutaraldehyde were investigated in the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity test system using five different bacterial strains (TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102, and TA104). The materials as well as the ingredients were eluted in both dimethyl sulfoxide and physiologic saline, and serially diluted eluates were used in the plate incorporation test. Pertac Universal Bond and Prisma Universal Bond did not elicit any mutagenic effects in any of the bacterial strains. In contrast, Syntac adhesive showed clear mutagenicity in S. typhimurium strain TA102. Dimethyl sulfoxide eluates, as well as physiologic saline eluates of the Syntac bonding agent, caused numbers of revertants that were about 6 times higher than control values. Reversion rates with other strains were moderately enhanced. Glutaraldehyde, an ingredient of Syntac adhesives, caused mutagenicity in a manner similar to Syntac adhesive eluates. Neither 2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate nor methylmethacrylate monomer was found to be mutagenic over a broad concentration range., Yes: 0.02, No: 0.98\n",
            "Question: Coutarea hexandra is a species commonly known in Brazil as quina, and its bark is used in folk medicine. In this study, we assess the mutagenic and DNA-damaging effects of ethanol extracts from C. hexandra stem bark (SCH) and leaves (LCH) by employing the Ames test on the TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium in addition to a plasmid treatment test. Furthermore, we performed a phytochemical analysis by TLC and HPLC, a quantification of the phenolic constituents and an assessment of the antioxidative activity. SCH and LCH showed mutagenic action in the Ames test for TA98 strains after metabolic activation. LCH also showed mutagenicity for the TA100 strain after metabolic activation. The findings from the plasmid treatment test did not indicate any DNA-damaging activity for either of the extracts with the tested dosages. SCH showed greater flavonoid content and greater antioxidative potential in relation to LCH. This study suggests that caution is advisable in the use of this plant. However, in vivo studies should be conducted to confirm these data., Yes: 0.69, No: 0.31\n",
            "Question: Tris(8-quinolinolato-N1, O8) aluminum (AlQ), an aluminum chelate of 8-hydroxyquinoline (8OHQ) is an important charge transfer molecule in semiconducting imaging devices. This study was conducted to evaluate AlQ and 8OHQ for the ability to induce reverse mutations, either in the presence or absence of mammalian microsomal enzymes, and to determine if AlQ decomposes or is metabolized to 8OHQ under assay conditions. The tester strains used in the mutation assay were Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537 and Escherichia coli WP2uvrA (pKM101). The assays were conducted in the presence and absence of S9. AlQ doses were 1-1000 microg per plate while 8OHQ doses were 0.947-947 microg per plate to maintain molar equivalency. Stability studies were carried out for 4h at 37 degrees C under conditions designed to mimic mutation assays. Samples were analyzed by HPLC and LC/MS to tentatively identify potential metabolites of AlQ and 8OHQ. The results of the bacterial mutagenicity assay indicate that in the presence of S9, both AlQ and 8OHQ, caused increases in the mean number of revertants per plate with tester strains TA100 and WP2uvrA (pKM101). No increases were observed with any of the remaining tester strain/activation condition combinations. The stability study showed that AlQ degrades readily to 8OHQ under standard mutagenicity test conditions, and the positive test result with AlQ is due to the bioactivation of 8OHQ. In the presence of S9, 8OHQ is metabolized to one detectable product with molecular weight indicative of a one-oxygen insertion. 8OHQ N-oxide and 2,8-quinolinediol were ruled out as possible metabolites; 8OHQ epoxides and other quinolinediols were neither confirmed nor ruled out. Bacterial mutagenicity tests have not been shown to predict in vivo effects of 8OHQ; these assays are similarly expected to be poorly predictive of in vivo genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of AlQ., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: N-Nitrodimethylamine, N-nitrodiethylamine, N-nitromorpholine and their N-nitroso analogs, N-nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosodiethylamine, and N-nitrosomorpholine, were tested in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA1530. The mutagenicity of all compounds, except N-nitrodiethylamine, was demonstrated in liquid incubation assays in at least one of the tester strains; it required the presence of a postmitochondrial supernatant from the liver of Aroclor-treated rats, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-generating system, and oxygen. When compared on a molar basis with their N-nitroso analogs, N-nitromorpholine was about 10 times less mutagenic and N-nitrodimethylamine about 70 times less mutagenic. Addition of disulfiram to the assays at a final concentration of 0.1 mM efficiently inhibited mutagenesis by all nitro and nitroso compounds; ascorbic acid at a 7.4 mM concentration produced less inhibition. Mutagenic activity of the three nitramines was also determined in the host-mediated assay in rats. After p.o. administration of each of the N-nitramines, cells of S. typhimurium strains TA1530 and TA100 that had been injected i.p. were isolated from the peritoneal liquid after 1, 3, and 6 hr. All three nitramines were found to be mutagenic for strain TA1530 but not for TA100. Mutation frequencies (number of histidine revertants per 10(6) surviving cells) were in the descending order N-nitromorpholine greater than N-nitrodiemethylamine greater than N-nitrodiethylamine. After a p.o. dose of N-nitrodiethylamine to rats, bacteria were also isolated from liver, lungs, and kidneys. Mutation frequency was highest in bacteria recovered from the liver but was not increased in those obtained from lungs and kidneys. The data suggest that carcinogenic nitramines exert their mutagenic effects through the formation of alkylating intermediates., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Several mutants with decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were isolated from the sensitive mutagen tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA100 after treatment with u.v. and selection for resistance to N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG) and its methyl analogue MNNG. Estimation of the GSH concentration and GSH S-transferase activity in extracts of these strains and of TA100 indicates that the GSH- derivatives contain 10-30% of the GSH level found in TA100, and that they exhibit normal GSH S-transferase activity. The mutagenic activities of 7 chemicals, namely, MNNG, ENNG, 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE), 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), styrene-7,8-oxide (STOX), N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) were compared in TA100 and in one representative GSH- strain, denominated NG-57. MNNG, ENNG, DBE and CDNB are potent to extremely potent mutagens in TA100, but induce very low levels of His+ mutants in NG-57. Pretreatment of NG-57 with 1 mM GSH (partially) restores the mutant yields to the levels usually found in TA100. The mutagenic activities of STOX, ENU and MMS are similar in both strains. These results support some previous findings, namely that ENNG, MNNG and DBE, but not ENU are activated to mutagens inside the test bacteria, and also suggest that CDNB is activated by bacterial GSH. The latter finding is in contrast with the current view that CDNB is detoxified by GSH, as is also presently evidenced by a strong reduction of the compound's mutagenicity in the presence of extracts of rat liver, which contains GSH and GSH S-transferase activity. The results with STOX indicate that GSH plays in bacteria a much less important role in the detoxification of xenobiotics than in mammalian tissue, presumably due to a much lower GSH S-transferase activity in the first organism., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Possible mutagenic and co-mutagenic effects of strong static magnetic fields were estimated using bacterial mutagenicity test. Mutagenic potential of static magnetic fields up to 5T (T:1T=10,000 G) was not detected by the bacterial mutagenicity test using four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537) and Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA either in the pre-incubation method or in the plate incorporation method. In the co-mutagenicity test, E. coli WP2 uvrA cells were treated with various chemical mutagens and were simultaneously exposed to a 2T or a 5T static magnetic field. Mutation rate in the exposed group was significantly higher than that in the non-exposed group when cells were treated with N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS), 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO), 2-amino-3-methyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) or 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (AF-2). The mutagenicity of 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA), 9-aminoacridine (9-AA), N4-aminocytidine and 2-acetoamidofluorene (2-AAF) was not affected by the magnetic field exposure. Possible mechanisms of the co-mutagenicity of magnetic fields are discussed., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Ellagic acid (EA) is a phenolic compound with antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic properties. It occurs naturally in some foods such as strawberries, raspberries, grapes, black currants and walnuts. In the present study, we used the Salmonella microsuspension assay to examine the antimutagenicity of EA against the potent mutagen aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) using tester strains TA98 and TA100. Further, we used a two-stage incubation procedure that incorporates washing the bacterial cells free of the incubation mixture after the first incubation to investigate EA and AFB1 interaction. Three different concentrations of AFB1 (2.5, 5 and 10 ng/tube) were tested against five different concentrations of EA for TA98 and TA100. EA significantly inhibited mutagenicity of all doses of AFB1 in both tester strains with the addition of S9. EA alone was not mutagenic at the concentrations tested. The greatest inhibitory effect of EA on AFB1 mutagenicity occurred when EA and AFB1 were incubated together. Lower inhibition was apparent when the cells were first incubated with EA followed by a second incubation with AFB1, and also when the cells were first incubated with AFB1 followed by a second incubation with EA alone. The results of the sequential incubation studies support the hypothesis that one mechanism of inhibition could involve the formation of a chemical complex between EA and AFB1., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: DL-p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) and its derivatives were evaluated for genotoxic effects using Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis strains lacking various DNA-repair mechanisms in spottest and in suspension test. The mutagenic activity of studied compounds was determined by the Ames test. Reverse mutation test was performed with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537 without S9 mix. 0.02 M nitrosomethylurea (NMU) standard mutagen was used as a positive control. The results showed that the parent nonessential amino acid PCPA had no detectable genotoxic and mutagenic activities in bacteria. The methyl ester of this amino acid and its N-phenylacetyl derivative possessed weak genotoxicity. Meanwhile N-sec-butyloxycarbonyl, N-benzyloxycarbonyl, N-(p-nitrophenylacetyl) and N-(p-nitrophenoxyacetyl) derivatives of DL-p-chlorophenylalanine exhibited appreciable genotoxicity. Among the seven tested compounds only N-benzyloxycarbonyl and N-(p-nitrophenoxyacetyl) derivatives of DL-p-chlorophenylalanine have been found to be mutagenic. Only parent PCPA possessed antimutagenic properties in respect of nitrosomethylurea. The structural modification, which strongly affects genotoxicity and mutagenicity perhaps may be due to steric hydrance of the substituents, causing interference with enzyme and DNA interactions., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The hot water extract of the herbal tea, Gynostemma pentaphyllum Makino, was not found to be mutagenic in Salmonella mutation assay with or without metabolic activation. However, the extract had both DT-diaphorase inducing activity in the murine hepatoma (Hepa1c1c7) cell line and antimutagenic properties towards chemical-induced mutation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. Mutagenicity of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido [1, 2-a: 3', 2', 3-d] imidazole (Glu-P-1), 2-aminodipyrido [1, 2-a: 3', 2', 3-d] imidazole (GIu-P-2), 2-amino-1, 4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido [4, 3-b] indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido [4, 3-b] indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo [4, 5-f] quinoline (IQ) and Benzo [a] pyrene (B[a]P) was inhibited by the extract of Gynostemma pentaphyllum Makino in a dose-dependent manner, but no effect was found on the mutagenic activity of 2-(2-Furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (AF-2). However, the extract enhanced the mutagenicity induced by 2-aminoanthracene (2AA), and N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Four different model nucleophiles, 4-(p-nitrobenzyl)pyridine (NBP), N-methylmercaptoimidazole (MMI), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and H2O were tested with 22 methanesulphonates of widely varying structures for their suitability to predict mutagenic activities in S. typhimurium TA100. The soft nucleophiles NBP (N-alkylation) and MMI (S-alkylation) revealed as highly sensitive for SN2 reactivities whereas TFA (solvolysis at the O-atom) and H2O (hydrolysis) were very sensitive for SN1 reactivities. No correlation between the NBP or the MMI test and the Ames test was found. Quite good correlations could be demonstrated for the TFA test and the hydrolysis rates: with rising activities in the TFA solvolysis the mutagenic potencies were increasing up to a maximum at i-propyl methanesulphonate. After that due to the fast hydrolysis the mutagenicities were decreasing again despite increasing TFA solvolysis rates. In general the secondary methanesulphonates exerted high SN1 reactivities and distinct mutagenic activities, whereas the primary compounds showed no or very low SN1 reactivities and low mutagenic potentials. The \"activated\" compounds cyclopropylmethyl methanesulphonate, benzyl methanesulphonate and allyl methanesulphonate exerted high SN1 and SN2 reactivities. Methyl methanesulphonate displayed a high mutagenicity in spite of its lack in SN1 reactivity. This is probably due to the induction of the error prone repair (pkM 101 plasmid in TA100). The relation between the alkylating reactivities (SN1 and SN2) and the molecular mechanisms leading to back mutation is discussed., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of root canal filling cements of various chemical composition were determined in vitro. Materials set for 24 h and 1 wk were eluted for 24 h in cell culture medium (cytotoxicity testing) and dimethyl sulfoxide or physiological saline (mutagenicity testing). The differences between cytotoxic potencies of eluates of the endodontic materials on L-929 cells were quantified colorimetrically (MTT test). Eluates of Traitement SPAD were about 5- to 30-fold more toxic than silver-free AH26, Tubli-Seal, CRCS, and Endomethsone N. The rank order of the toxic effects depended on the setting time of mixed materials. Dimethyl sulfoxide and saline eluates of Traitement SPAD, Tubli-Seal, Endomethasone N, CRCS, and Ketac-Endo were not mutagenic in the Ames test. Both eluates of silver-free AH26 set for 24 h were weakly mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA100. Weak mutagenicity of saline eluates of the material was also observed in TA97a and TA102. These results point to the possibility that mixed silver-free AH26 might contain small amounts of two mutagenic substances: bisphenol A diglycidyl ether and formaldehyde., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Mutagenicities of 2,4- and 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,4-and 2,6-DNT), and reduced metabolites formed by the incubation of 2,4- and 2,6-DNT with Salmonella typhimurium TA98, were tested using S. typhimurium YG strains possessing high level of nitroreductase (NR) and/or O-acetyltransferase (OAT) activities. All compounds tested showed greatest mutagenic activities toward strains YG1041 and YG1042, which possess high levels of NR and OAT activities. The relative mutagenic activities of 2,4-DNT and its related compounds toward YG1041 and YG1042 were aminonitrotoluenes<2,4-DNT<2,2'-dimethyl-5, 5'-dinitroazoxybenzene (2,2'-DM-5, 5'-DNAOB)4-hydroxylamino-2-nitrotoluene (4HA2NT)<<4, 4'-dimethyl-3,3'-dinitroazoxybenzene (4,4'-DM-3,3'-DNAOB), and aminonitrotoluenes (2A4AT, 4A2NT)<2,4-DNT<4HA2NT4,4'-dimethyl-3, 3'-dinitroazoxybenzene (4,4'-DM-3,3'-DNAOB)<2HA4NT, respectively. In addition, the relative mutagenic activities of 2,6-DNT and its related compounds toward YG1041 and YG1042 were 2, 6-DNT<2-hydroxylamino-6-nitrotoluene (2HA6NT)<2,2'-dimethyl-3, 3'-dinitroazoxybenzene (2,2'-DM-3,3'-DNAOB), and 2-amino-6-nitrotoluene (2A6NT)<2,6-DNT<2HA6NT, respectively. These results, together with previous findings, suggested that aminohydroxylamino dimethylazoxybenzenes or aminohydroxylamino dimethylazobenzenes produced either by the reduction of hydroxylaminonitrotoluenes or by the reduction of dimethyl dinitroazoxybenzenes are active metabolites responsible for the mutagenic activities of 2,4- and 2,6-DNT., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Inonotus obliquus is a mushroom commonly known as Chaga that is widely used in folk medicine in Siberia, North America, and North Europe. Here, we evaluated the antimutagenic and antioxidant capacities of subfractions of Inonotus obliquus extract. The ethyl acetate extract was separated by vacuum chromatography into three fractions, and the fraction bearing the highest antimutagenic activity was subsequently separated into four fractions by reversed phase (ODS-C18) column chromatography. The most antimutagenic fraction was then separated into two subfractions (subfractions 1 and 2) by normal phase silica gel column chromatography. Ames test analysis revealed that the subfractions were not mutagenic. At 50 μg/plate, subfractions 1 and 2 strongly inhibited the mutagenesis induced in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 by the directly acting mutagen MNNG (0.4 μg/plate) by 80.0% and 77.3%, respectively. They also inhibited 0.15 μg/plate 4NQO-induced mutagenesis in TA98 and TA100 by 52.6-62.0%. The mutagenesis in TA98 induced by the indirectly acting mutagens Trp-P-1 (0.15 μg/plate) and B(α)P (10 μg/plate) was reduced by 47.0-68.2% by the subfractions, while the mutagenesis in TA100 by Trp-P-1 and B(α)P was reduced by 70.5-87.2%. Subfraction 1 was more inhibitory than subfraction 2 with regard to the mutagenic effects of 4NQO, Trp-P-1, and B(α)P. Subfractions 1 and 2 also had a strong antioxidant activity against DPPH radicals and were identified by MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR analyses as 3β-hydroxy-lanosta-8, 24-dien-21-al and inotodiol, respectively. Thus, we show that the 3beta-hydroxy-lanosta-8, 24-dien-21-al and inotodiol components of Inonotus obliquus bear antimutagenic and antioxidative activities., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Formaldehyde was examined for bacterial mutagenicity using Escherichia coli WP2(pKM101) and WP2uvrA(pKM101), and Salmonella typhimurium TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98, TA100 and TA102, in the absence of any exogenous source of metabolic activation. Using pre-incubation exposure, clear mutagenicity was seen for TA98, TA100 and TA102, and both E. coli strains. In standard plate-incorporation assays, consistent mutagenicity was seen only for TA100 and WP2uvrA(pKM101). No evidence of mutagenicity was seen for TA1535, TA1537 or TA1538 using either method of exposure. These data confirm the enhanced ability of the pre-incubation method to detect the mutagenicity of formaldehyde both quantitatively, as expressed by numbers of revertant colonies, and qualitatively, in terms of the range of indicator strains reverted. The relatively greater sensitivity of the pre-incubation assay is probably due to better containment of a volatile agent and/or lack of interaction with agar during the initial period of exposure. The findings are consistent with the suggestion that formaldehyde induces lesions in bacteria which are, at least to some extent, excision-repairable, and indicate that the presence of the R-factor plasmid may be required for the expression of its mutagenicity in excision repair-deficient Salmonella., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: 1. Rat liver 9,000 g supernatant protected against the mutagenic effect of chlorinated hydrophilic macromolecular humic acids (CHMA) in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100. 2. Protection against mutagenicity of CHMA was mediated by glutathione and was partially dependent on glutathione S-transferase activity. 3. In contrast to the above findings, CHMA showed lower mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli strains of bacteria that are deficient in glutathione compared to their mutagenicity in parental (glutathione-rich) bacterial strains. 4. Glutathione-deficient cells do not provide test systems with elevated sensitivity for the detection of mutagenic chlorinated humic substances., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of root canal filling cements of various chemical composition were determined in vitro. Materials set for 24 h and 1 wk were eluted for 24 h in cell culture medium (cytotoxicity testing) and dimethyl sulfoxide or physiological saline (mutagenicity testing). The differences between cytotoxic potencies of eluates of the endodontic materials on L-929 cells were quantified colorimetrically (MTT test). Eluates of Traitement SPAD were about 5- to 30-fold more toxic than silver-free AH26, Tubli-Seal, CRCS, and Endomethsone N. The rank order of the toxic effects depended on the setting time of mixed materials. Dimethyl sulfoxide and saline eluates of Traitement SPAD, Tubli-Seal, Endomethasone N, CRCS, and Ketac-Endo were not mutagenic in the Ames test. Both eluates of silver-free AH26 set for 24 h were weakly mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA100. Weak mutagenicity of saline eluates of the material was also observed in TA97a and TA102. These results point to the possibility that mixed silver-free AH26 might contain small amounts of two mutagenic substances: bisphenol A diglycidyl ether and formaldehyde., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Chlorine gas was used to treat aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). The time-related exposure study showed that 4 ml (15 mg) pure chlorine gas caused about 90% destruction of 100 micrograms AFB1 within 10 min, at standard temperature and pressure. Four fluorescent reaction products were produced, two of which were identified as 8,9-dichloro-AFB1 and 8,9-dihydroxy-AFB1 (diol). The use of [14C]AFB1 confirmed the 90% destruction of the compound by chlorine gas. An increased destruction of AFB1 also occurred when an increased amount of chlorine gas was used. The mutagenic activity of the AFB1 sample treated for 10 min was reduced to about 5% of the untreated control using the Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the presence of a rat-liver S-9 mix. A similar time-related reduction in AFB1 toxicity after chlorine treatment was also achieved using the chicken embryo toxicity assay., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Sulfonic acid esters are considered as potentially alkylating agents that may exert genotoxic effects in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. One possible source of human exposure stems from drug synthesis when the salt-forming agents methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid are used together with alcoholic solvents such as methanol, ethanol and propanol. In this study computer-assisted structural considerations and in vitro approaches (Ames mutagenicity test using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100, and the micronucleus test using L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells) were used to assess the genotoxic properties of 19 sulfonic esters. While all esters may be principally active as genotoxicants based on the presence of the sulfonate moiety, the statistical correlative multiple computer automated structure evaluation (MCASE) system (MC4PC version 1.0) using the Ames mutagenicity A2I module (version 1.54), rank-ordered the activity of the benzenesulfonic acid esters in the Ames test negligible due to an inactivating modulator and a deactivating fragment, whereas the methane- and toluenesulfonic acid esters were predicted to be positive in this test. In the Ames test, with the exception of the p-toluenesulfonic acid ethyl and iso-butyl esters, all compounds came out positive in Salmonella strain TA100. Methanesulfonic iso-propyl, sec-butyl and benzenesulfonic acid iso-propyl ester also showed mutagenic potential in strain TA98. In general, differences between results seen in Ames tests performed with or without metabolic activation were rather small. In L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, benzenesulfonic acid n- and iso-butyl ester and p-toluenesulfonic acid iso-butyl ester did not increase the number of cells containing micronuclei. The other esters were positive in this micronucleus test; however, methanesulfonic acid iso-butyl ester was found to be only weakly positive at excessively cytotoxic concentrations. These compounds were generally found to be more potent with regard to micronucleus induction when tested without metabolic activation (20 h treatment). In conclusion, the iso-propyl esters of the three sulfonic acids under study were found to be the strongest mutagens, either when tested in the Ames test or the micronucleus assay, whereas p-toluenesulfonic acid iso-butyl ester was the only compound shown to be devoid of a genotoxic potential in both tests., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The urine of mice injected intraperitoneally with pyrene during exposure to NO2 was found to contain highly mutagenic compounds by means of the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98. The mice were exposed to 20 ppm NO2 for 3 days before intraperitoneal injection of pyrene (800 mg/kg of body weight). The pyrene-treated mice were further exposed to NO2 for an additional 24 hr, and the urine from the mice was collected in ice-cooled containers and stored frozen in the dark. The collected samples were treated with beta-glucuronidase and passed through activated Sep-Pack C18 cartridges. After elution with methanol, the effluent was concentrated and the residue was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The DMSO solution was fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography and the mutagenicity of each fraction was assayed with S. typhimurium strain TA98. The mutagenic compounds 3-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, 6-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, 8-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, and 1-hydroxypyrene were identified in the mutagenic fractions by mass spectrometry and UV-visible spectrophotometry with synthetic reference substances. These mutagenic compounds may have been formed by either nitration of hydroxylated pyrene, or hydroxylation of 1-nitropyrene, which is formed in vivo from pyrene and NO2, or the simultaneous occurrence of these two reactions in the mouse body., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Gentiopicroside (1) is the major secoiridoid glucoside constituent of Cephalaria kotschyi roots. The mutagenicity, DNA-damaging capacities, and clastogenicity of this molecule were evaluated by the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay (Ames test) on tester strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA102, the alkaline comet assay, and the micronucleus assay on CHO cells. All tests were performed with and without the metabolization mixture, S9 mix. In the Ames test, the mutagenicity of 1 was limited to TA102 without S9 mix (2.3 rev microg(-1)). The genotoxicity was more evident without S9 mix (0.78 OTMchi(2) units microg(-1) mL) than with the metabolic mixture (0.16 OTMchi(2) units microg(-1) mL) with the comet assay. Similarly, the clastogenicity without S9 mix was 0.99 MNC microg(-1) mL and 0.38 MNC microg(-1) mL with S9 mix in the micronucleus assay. The interaction of 1 with DNA is probably through the involvement of oxidative DNA lesions., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: In this study, solid fermentation of steamed black soybean with various GRAS (Generally recognized as safe) filamentious-fungi including Aspergillus awamori, Aspergillus oryzae BCRC 30222, Aspergillus sojae BCRC 30103, Rhizopus azygosporus BCRC 31158 and Rhizopus sp. No. 2 was performed. Mutagenicity and antimutagenicity of the methanol extracts of unfermented and fermented steamed black soybeans against 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO), a direct mutagen and Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), an indirect mutagen, on Salmonella Typhimurium TA100 and TA 98, were examined. The methanol extracts of unfermented and fermented steamed black soybeans show no mutagenic activity for either test strains at the doses tested. The extracts inhibited mutagenesis by either 4-NQO or B[a]P in S. Typhimurium TA100 and TA98. Fermentation with fungi also enhanced the antimutagenic effect of black soybean while the antimutagenic effect of the fermented black soybeans extract varied with the starter organism, mutagen, and test strain of S. Typhimurium examined. Generally, the extracts of A. awamori-fermented black soybean exhibited the highest antimutagenic effect. With strain TA100, the inhibitory effects of 5.0 mg of A. awamori-fermented black soybean extract per plate on the mutagenic effects of 4-NQO and B[a]P were 92% and 89%, respectively, while the corresponding rates for extract of unfermented were 41% and 63%, respectively. With strain 98, the inhibition rates were 94 and 81% for the fermented bean extract and 58% and 44% for the unfermented bean extracts. Testing of extracts prepared from black soybean by A. awamori at temperatures 25, 30 and 35 degrees C and for times of 1-5 days revealed that, generally, the extract prepared from beans fermented at 30 degrees C for 3 days exhibited the greatest inhibition against the mutagenic effects of 4-NQO and B[a]P., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Five aromatic nitroso compounds were prepared and their mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 compared with that of the corresponding hydroxylamines and the previously studied nitroarenes. A remarkable correspondence of the dose-response curves was observed between the nitroso and the respective hydroxylamine compounds. This effect could be observed in TA98 and TA100. It was only marginally dependent on the metabolical activation by rat liver S9-mix. Even the presence of a bulky alkyl substituent either near to the functional group, or far away from it, previously shown to considerably influence the mutagenic properties of nitroarenes, does not remarkably affect the properties of the nitroso and hydroxylamine species. The similarity between the latter two is likely to be due to a fast reduction of the nitrosoarenes to the hydroxylamine species under the test conditions. It seems that enzymes are not responsible for that reduction step, because sterical crowding near the functional group does not influence that behaviour. The test results of the aromatic hydroxylamines bearing a bulky substituent show that there are at least two ways to influence the mutagenicity of an aromatic nitro compound by such a group. A substituent near the functional group (ortho-position) disturbs the enzymatic reduction of the nitro group, because 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxylaminobiphenyl and its corresponding nitroso compound are highly mutagenic, whereas 3-tert-butyl-4-nitrobiphenyl was previously shown to be inactive even after addition of S9-mix. In contrast, 4'-tert-butyl-4-hydroxylaminobiphenyl with the tert-butyl group \"far away\" from the hydroxylamino functionality clearly shows decreased mutagenic activity suggesting a different influence of a substituent in that position. In addition, the substance shows only little cell toxicity even at higher concentrations. Both effects could be due to a reduced effective dose of the hydroxylamine in the cells compared to the non-alkylated compound, caused by a faster degradation of the hydroxylamine or a hindered interaction between that substance and the cells., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The Escherichia coli mu operon was subcloned into a pKK233-2 vector containing rat glutathione S-transferase (GST) 5-5 cDNA and the plasmid thus obtained was introduced into Salmonella typhimurium TA1535. The newly developed strain S.typhimurium NM5004, was found to have 52-fold greater GST activity than the original umu strain S.typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. We compared sensitivities of these two tester strains, NM5004 and TA1535/pSK1002, for induction of umuC gene expression with several dihaloalkanes which are activated or inactivated by GST 5-5 activity. The induction of umuC gene expression by these chemicals was monitored by measuring the cellular beta-galactosidase activity produced by umuC\"lacZ fusion gene in these two tester strains. Ethylene dibromide, 1-bromo-2-chloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and methylene dichloride induced umuC gene expression more strongly in the NM5004 strain than the original strain. 4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine were found to induce umuC gene expression to similar extents in both strains. In the case of 1-nitropyrene and 2-nitrofluorene, however, NM5004 strain showed weaker umuC gene expression responses than the original TA1535/pSK1002 strain. 1,2-Epoxy-3-(4'-nitrophenoxy)propane, a known substrate for GST 5-5, was found to inhibit umuC induction caused by 1-bromo-2-chloroethane. These results indicate that this new tester NM5004 strain expressing a mammalian GST theta class enzyme may be useful for studies of environmental chemicals proposed to be activated or inactivated by GST activity., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Chloropicrin (CCl3NO2) is a major soil fumigant for control of fungi, insects and nematodes and may by formed by chlorination of drinking water. It is also a strong lacrimator and induces sister chromatid exchanges in cultured human lymphocytes. Mutagenicity assays of CCl3NO2 in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 establish that it is toxic but not mutagenic at 500 nmol/plate but becomes mutagenic but not toxic on addition of S9 (previous work) or 1-2 molar equivalents of glutathione (GSH) (this study). The preincubation assay is superior to the plate incorporation test giving 2-4-fold higher revertants/nmol. Using the preincubation assay with GSH at 5 mM (a biomimetic level) in the top agar gives linear dose-response relationships for CCl3NO2 and its dechlorination products CHCl2NO2 and CH2ClNO2 with 0.56, 0.56 and 1.8 revertants/nmol, respectively. The mutagenicity values for CHCl2NO2 and CH2ClNO2 are the same in the presence and the absence of GSH, which only improves the linearity at high levels by reducing toxicity to the bacteria. GSH activation of CCl3NO2 mutagenicity may be due to reductive dechlorination of the trichloro compound to the more active CHCl2NO2 and CH2ClNO2. Alternatively, the mutagenicity may result from an intermediate GSH conjugate such as GSCCl2NO2 or GSCHClNO2. In comparison, the mutagenicity of CH2Br2 and CH2I2 is affected little if any by addition of GSH and these dihalomethanes are much less active than the halonitromethane series. It therefore appears that CCl3NO2 is not mutagenic in the absence of activation and that the dechlorinated metabolites CHCl2NO2 and CH2ClNO2 are moderately potent bacterial mutagens, consistent with the possible genotoxicity of CCl3NO2 in mammals., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Postmitochondrial supernatant from rat liver and kidney homogenates transformed cysteine into a mutagen that reverted bacteria of the strain Salmonella typhimurium TA100 to histidine independence. Glutathione was also activated by kidney postmitochondrial supernatant but not by liver preparations. Hence, important endogenous compounds of mammals are positive in the most commonly used short-term test for carcinogenicity and mutagenicity. Glutathione is positive in the test even at concentrations found in mammalian tissues., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: In this study, solid fermentation of steamed black soybean with various GRAS (Generally recognized as safe) filamentious-fungi including Aspergillus awamori, Aspergillus oryzae BCRC 30222, Aspergillus sojae BCRC 30103, Rhizopus azygosporus BCRC 31158 and Rhizopus sp. No. 2 was performed. Mutagenicity and antimutagenicity of the methanol extracts of unfermented and fermented steamed black soybeans against 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO), a direct mutagen and Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), an indirect mutagen, on Salmonella Typhimurium TA100 and TA 98, were examined. The methanol extracts of unfermented and fermented steamed black soybeans show no mutagenic activity for either test strains at the doses tested. The extracts inhibited mutagenesis by either 4-NQO or B[a]P in S. Typhimurium TA100 and TA98. Fermentation with fungi also enhanced the antimutagenic effect of black soybean while the antimutagenic effect of the fermented black soybeans extract varied with the starter organism, mutagen, and test strain of S. Typhimurium examined. Generally, the extracts of A. awamori-fermented black soybean exhibited the highest antimutagenic effect. With strain TA100, the inhibitory effects of 5.0 mg of A. awamori-fermented black soybean extract per plate on the mutagenic effects of 4-NQO and B[a]P were 92% and 89%, respectively, while the corresponding rates for extract of unfermented were 41% and 63%, respectively. With strain 98, the inhibition rates were 94 and 81% for the fermented bean extract and 58% and 44% for the unfermented bean extracts. Testing of extracts prepared from black soybean by A. awamori at temperatures 25, 30 and 35 degrees C and for times of 1-5 days revealed that, generally, the extract prepared from beans fermented at 30 degrees C for 3 days exhibited the greatest inhibition against the mutagenic effects of 4-NQO and B[a]P., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: To investigate the formation of aromatic amine-like mutagenic activity in cooked grain foods, amino acids were heated alone or in binary combinations at either 150 or 210 degrees C. About half of the binary mixtures of arginine heated with other amino acids produced potent mutagenic responses in the Ames/Salmonella assay, but only cysteine produced mutagenic products when heated alone. One-to-one molar ratios of arginine heated with threonine, valine, cystine, cysteine or tryptophan produced reaction products that gave 1200-3200 revertants/mmol in Salmonella strain TA98 with metabolic activation. 1-Methylguanidine, a fragment of arginine, produced a mutagenic response when heated alone or in binary mixtures with all amino acids tested. Analysis of reaction product extracts by solid-phase extraction and HPLC failed to find the known heterocyclic amines commonly found in cooked meats that would explain the measured mutagenic activity. As judged by biological and chemical characterization, several new aromatic amine mutagens are formed by heating some simple amino acids combined with arginine, and these reactants may be the source of the mutagenic products detected in the extracts of some cooked grain-based foods., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Levels of 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) were determined in both striated muscle (fillets) and whole body extracts of fish specimens harvested during a two-year period (1987-1989) from the Pigeon River (between Hartford and Newport) of Eastern Tennessee (USA). Whole body (wet weight) fish extract levels as high as 117 micrograms/kg body weight and composite fish fillet (wet weight) extract levels as high as 87 micrograms/kg fillet weight were observed. Pure TCDD was found to be highly toxic to the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, and TA100 at dosages which exceeded 825 ng TCDD/ml in the top agar of the Ames Salmonella assay. An 825 ng/ml TCDD dosage was not mutagenic to any of the tested Salmonella strains, either with or without metabolic activation (S9 mix). However, when acidic fish extracts from the Pigeon River were tested for mutagenicity, most of the fish extracts were mutagenic to Salmonella strains TA97, TA98, and TA100. These mutagenic extracts also demonstrated mutagenic dose-response curves. Other chemicals within the extracts as well as synergistic effects may account for the mutagenicity., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Cassia fistula L. (Fabaceae) fruits are highly recommended in folklore medicine for curing various ailments. In the current study, methanol (CaFM), hexane (CaFH), chloroform (CaFCl), ethyl acetate (CaFE), butanol (CaFB) and aqueous (CaFA) fractions of C. fistula fruits were investigated for their potential to inhibit the genotoxicity of mutagens and free radicals. The antimutagenicity of fractions was evaluated against the reactive carcinogenic ester generating mutagen, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) and frame-shift mutation inducing mutagen, 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD) in Ames Salmonella typhimurium TA98 tester strain. Among the fractions, CaFE showed strongest protective effect against the mutagenicity of both S9-dependent and direct-acting mutagen with an inhibitory percentage of 81% and 64% at the concentration of 1 × 10 3  and 2.5 × 10 3  respectively. All the fractions were analyzed for free radical scavenging activity using DPPH, nitric oxide, lipid peroxidation and superoxide anion assays. CaFE fraction showed maximum antioxidant activity in comparison to other fractions with an IC 50  of 97.01, 172.36, 144 and 264.79 μg/ml respectively. High performance liquid chromatography showed the presence of catechin, epicatechin and umbelliferone in appreciable amount which may account for its efficacy in combating free radicals and also showed protective effect against the mutagenicity of S9-dependent mutagen, 2-AF., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The nephrotoxicity and nephrocarcinogenicity of trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) are believed to be mediated primarily through the cysteine S-conjugate β-lyase-dependent bioactivation of the corresponding cysteine S-conjugate metabolites S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (DCVC) and S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (TCVC), respectively. DCVC and TCVC have previously been demonstrated to be mutagenic by the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay, and reduction in mutagenicity was observed upon treatment with the β-lyase inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA). Because DCVC and TCVC can also be bioactivated through sulfoxidation to yield the potent nephrotoxicants S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine sulfoxide (DCVCS) and S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine sulfoxide (TCVCS), respectively, the mutagenic potential of these two sulfoxides was investigated using the Ames Salmonella typhimurium TA100 mutagenicity assay. The results show both DCVCS and TCVCS were mutagenic, and TCVCS exhibited 3-fold higher mutagenicity than DCVCS. However, DCVCS and TCVCS mutagenic activity was approximately 700-fold and 30-fold lower than DCVC and TCVC, respectively. DCVC and DCVCS appeared to induce toxicity in TA100, as evidenced by increased microcolony formation and decreased mutant frequency above threshold concentrations. TCVC and TCVCS were not toxic in TA100. The toxic effects of DCVC limited the sensitivity of TA100 to DCVC mutagenic effects and rendered it difficult to investigate the effects of AOAA on DCVC mutagenic activity. Collectively, these results suggest that DCVCS and TCVCS exerted a definite but weak mutagenicity in the TA100 strain. Therefore, despite their potent nephrotoxicity, DCVCS and TCVCS are not likely to play a major role in DCVC or TCVC mutagenicity in this strain., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and transforming activity of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) were studied by the assays of colony-forming efficiency (CFE), micronucleus formation (MN), and cell transformation in rat tracheal epithelial (RTE) cells both in vitro and in vivo. Liver S9, primary hepatocytes and RTE cells from normal and Aroclor-1254 induced rats were compared for bioactivation of NNK using Salmonella mutagenesis as the endpoint. Results from the in vitro experiments indicated that low concentrations of NNK (0.01-25 micrograms/ml) caused from 15% to greater than 100% increases in CFE of RTE cells. At high concentrations (100-200 micrograms/ml), NNK was significantly toxic to RTE cells. NNK treatment in vitro (50-200 micrograms/ml) increased MN frequency as much as 3-fold above background and significantly increased the transformation frequency (TF) in 4/5 (50 micrograms/ml) and 6/8 (100 micrograms/ml) experiments. The in vivo exposure of rats to NNK (150-450 mg/kg, given i.p.) resulted in a 60-85% reduction in CFE and a 3-5-fold increase in MN formation in RTE cells. In vivo treatment with cumulative doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg of NNK produced significant increases in TF of tracheal cells from 3/3 and 2/3 rats, respectively. Without activation, NNK was not mutagenic in Salmonella TA1535. The bioactivation of NNK to a mutagenic metabolite was achieved by incubation of NNK with liver S9 fraction from Aroclor-1254 induced rats or primary hepatocytes from both untreated and Aroclor-1254 pretreated rats. RTE cells did not produce sufficient quantities of mutagenic NNK metabolites to be detected by the Salmonella assay., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: alpha-Bisabolol (BISA) is a sesquiterpene alcohol found in the oils of chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) and other plants. BISA has been widely used in dermatological and cosmetic formulations. This study was undertaken to investigate the mutagenicity and antimutagenicity of BISA in the Salmonella/microsome assay. Mutagenicity of BISA was evaluated with TA100, TA98, TA97a and TA1535 Salmonella typhimurium strains, without and with addition of S9 mixture. No increase in the number of his+ revertant colonies over the negative (solvent) control values was observed with any of the four tester strains. In the antimutagenicity assays, BISA was tested up to the highest nontoxic dose (i.e. 50 and 150 microg/plate, with and without S9 mix, respectively) against direct-acting (sodium azide, SA; 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, 4-NQNO; 2-nitrofluorene, 2-NF; and nitro-o-phenylenediamine, NPD) as well as indirect-acting (cyclophosphamide, CP; benzo[a]pyrene, B[a]P; aflatoxin B1, AFB1; 2-aminoanthracene, 2-AA; and 2-aminofluorene, 2-AF) mutagens. BISA did not alter mutagenic activity of SA and of NPD, and showed only a weak inhibitory effect on the mutagenicity induced by 4-NQNO and 2-NF. The mutagenic effects of AFB1, CP, B[a]P, 2-AA and 2-AF, on the other hand, were all markedly and dose-dependently reduced by BISA. It was also found that BISA inhibited pentoxyresorufin-o-depentylase (PROD, IC50 2.76 microM) and ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD, 33.67 microM), which are markers for cytochromes CYP2B1 and 1A1 in rat liver microsomes. Since CYP2B1 converts AFB1 and CP into mutagenic metabolites, and CYP1A1 activates B[a]P, 2-AA and 2-AF, results suggest that BISA-induced antimutagenicity could be mediated by an inhibitory effect on the metabolic activation of these promutagens., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Saffron is harvested from the dried, dark red stigmas of Crocus sativus L. flowers. It is used as a spice for flavoring and coloring food and as a perfume. It is often used for treating several diseases. We assessed the antimutagenic, comutagenic and cytotoxic effects of saffron and its main ingredients using the Ames/Salmonella test system, two well known mutagens (BP, 2AA), the in vitro colony formation assay and four different cultured human normal (CCD-18Lu) and malignant (HeLa, A-204 and HepG2) cells. When only using the TA98 strain in the Ames/Salmonella test system, saffron showed non-mutagenic, as well as non-antimutagenic activity against BP-induced mutagenicity, and demonstrated a dose-dependent co-mutagenic effect on 2-AA-induced mutagenicity. The saffron component responsible for this unusual comutagenic effect was safranal. In the in vitro colony formation test system, saffron displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect only against human malignant cells. All isolated carotenoid ingredients of saffron demonstrated cytotoxic activity against in vitro tumor cells. Saffron crocin derivatives possessed a stronger inhibitory effect on tumor cell colony formation. Overall, these results suggest that saffron itself, as well as its carotenoid components might be used as potential cancer chemopreventive agents., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Non-volatile reaction products generated from the reactions of 70 mM aqueous chlorine or chlorine dioxide with 10 mM L-tryptophan were shown to be direct-acting mutagens to Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98. Several of the fluorescent bands obtained after thin-layer chromatographic fractionation of the XAD-2/8 resin concentrates of the reaction mixtures were shown to be more mutagenic than the reaction mixtures using the Ames Salmonella/microsome assay. In addition, these fractions were shown to be capable of increasing significantly the frequency of sister chromatid exchange in Chinese hamster ovary cells in the absence of rat liver S9 mix. GC/MS analysis of the products in a highly mutagenic fraction of the aqueous chlorine reaction products identified 1,1,3-trichloropropanone, 1,1,3,3-tetrachloropropanone and dichloroquinoline., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: 2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5',6,6'-Decachlorobiphenyl (PCB 209) is a fully chlorinated, non-coplanar biphenyl. To demonstrate that PCB 209 is not likely to exhibit human health hazards common to coplanar PCBs it was tested for cytochrome P450 (P450) enzyme induction potentials, genetic toxicity, and endocrine-modulating activity. PCB 209 (dose from 0.005 to 5000 ng/mL) did not significantly induce P450 CYP1A, 2A, 2B, 3A, or 4A enzyme activities in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. In contrast, Aroclor 1260, a PCB mixture that contains approximately 60% chlorine by weight, showed significant induction of P450 CYP1A, 2A, 2B, and 3A within the same dose range. PCB 209 (dose from 100 to 5000 microg/plate) was negative in the bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) test in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537 or in Eschericia coli strain WP2uvrA. PCB 209 (dose from 25 to 150 microg/mL) was also negative for forward mutations at the thymidine kinase (TK+/-) locus of L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells. The Ames and the mouse lymphoma assays were both conducted in the absence and presence of rat liver S9 fraction. PCB 209 (dose from 500 to 2000 mg/kg by single dose oral gavage) did not induce an increase in the frequency of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes in mouse bone marrow in vivo. PCB 209 did not induce estrogenic effects when administered by gavage to ovariectomized adult female rats at 500 and 1000 mg/kg for 4 days, nor did it produce alterations consistent with endocrine-modulating activity in adult intact male rats when administered by gavage at 500 and 1000 mg/kg for 15 consecutive days., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Among a variety of experimental protocols used, the combined use of 0.5% dextrose in bottom agar and 1 micromol of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) in preincubation mixtures without fraction S9 mix resulted in the highest level of induced Salmonella typhimurium his reversions with both dyes metanil yellow and orange 11 with strain TA100. Strain TA98 yielded notably lower levels of reversions under the same conditions. The presence of uninduced hamster liver S9 fraction resulted in a weak mutagenic response while Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver S9 fraction resulted in the complete absence of mutagenicity with both strains and with both dyes., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: To ascertain the in vitro genotoxicity of danthron and its potential mechanism of action, we performed an Ames test, a cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay and a comet assay in Balb/c 3T3 cells. The Ames test revealed that danthron was mutagenic only toward Salmonella typhimurium strain TA102 in the presence of an exogenous metabolic activation system (S9 mix). Danthron (25, 50 and 100μg/ml) increased the frequencies of micronuclear cells with or without S9 mix, and the comet length, tail length and Olive tail moment in comet assays without S9 mix in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrated the in vitro genotoxicity of danthron and that 3T3 cells are capable of activating danthron. When NADP was replaced by NAD in the S9 mix, danthron remained mutagenic toward strain TA102. The addition of dicoumarol, a DT-diaphorase inhibitor, decreased the number of danthron-induced histidine revertants by 35-39%, indicating that DT-diaphorase is involved in the metabolic activation of danthron in the presence of NADH as an electron donor. In 3T3 cells, increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels as well as a reduction in GSH levels were induced by danthron in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that oxidative stress may be a major contributing pathway in the genotoxicity of danthron., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading infectious causes of death due to single infectious agent after HIV/AIDS. Rifampicin (RIF), Isoniazid (INH), Ethambutol (EMB), Pyrazinamide (PZA) and/or their combinations are extensively prescribed to treat TB. Despite several therapeutic implications, these drugs also produce several toxic effects at cellular level. MTT assay and Ames test were adopted in this study for the determination of cytotoxic and mutagenic potential of these anti-TB drugs. Among all tested drugs, cytotoxic potential of RIF was strongest with highly significant decline (p<0.001) in cell numbers at the concentration of 250μg/ml with LC50 at 325μg/ml, while significant decline (p<0.01) in cell count was observed in INH treated group at the concentration 500μg/ml with LC50 at 1000μg/ml. Moreover, combination RIPE demonstrated significant reduction (p<0.01) in cell number at the concentration of 25-500-500-500μg/ml with LC50 at 60-1200-1200-1200μg/ml. It is apparent from the data that almost all drugs represented identical mutagenic pattern i.e., more significant results were achieved in TA100 with metabolic activation (+S9). RIF proved to be highly mutagenic of all tested drugs with significant mutagenicity (p<0.01) at 0.0525μg/plate against TA98 strain with S9. The combination RIPE exhibited highly significant mutagenic activity (p<0.01) at concentration 0.125-3-3-3μg/plate without S9, while addition of S9 resulted in similar activity at lower doses, i.e., 0.0525-1-1-1μg/plate. It was concluded from the data that all anti-TB drugs possess significant cytotoxic and mutagenic potential, especially in combination, making TB patient more vulnerable to cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of anti-TB drugs, which could produce further health complications in TB patients. , Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Increase in production of different types of plastics has led to increase in the amount of plastic waste generation worldwide. The chemical constituents of these plastic wastes have made their disposal an important economic and environmental health problem globally. This study assessed the mutagenic and genotoxic potential of plastic waste dumpsite raw and simulated leachates using the Ames Salmonella fluctuation test with  Salmonella typhimurium  strains TA98 and TA100, and the SOS chromotest with  Escherichia coli  PQ37. Physico-chemical parameters and organic constituents of the leachates were also analyzed. The result of the Ames test showed that the leachates are mutagenic even at low concentration. Also, the TA100 strain was the more responsive strain in terms of mutagenic index in the absence of metabolic activation. The SOS chromotest results complimented the Ames Salmonella fluctuation test results. Nevertheless, the  E. coli  PQ37 system was slightly more sensitive than the Salmonella assay for detecting mutagens and genotoxins in the tested leachates. Generally, simulated leachate showed a higher mutagenicity and genotoxicity than the raw leachate. Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, Cu, As, PBDEs, PAHs, PCBs, and Bisphenol A contents analyzed in the leachates were believed to play significant role in the observed mutagenicity and genotoxicity in the microbial assays. These data showed that plastic waste constituents are capable of inducing DNA damage in exposed organisms and might induce similar damage in plants, animals and humans exposed to it, hence, great care should be taken to eliminate indiscriminate disposal of plastics in the environment., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The comutagenic activity of sodium selenite and caffeine was studied by the Ames test. Reproduction of S. typhimurium TA1535 for 4 h at 37 degrees C in the nutrient broth with sodium selenide (5 micrograms/ml) significantly increased sensitivity of bacterial cells to the mutagenic action of 2-3 mM N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU). When using threshold concentrations of NMU the potentiation of mutagenesis reached 625.2%. The addition of 0.19 mg/ml of caffeine to the nutrient medium also led (though the action was less pronounced) to an increase in sensitivity of bacterial cells to the NMU mutagenic action. Reproduction of S. typhimurium TA1535 in the medium containing sodium selenide and caffeine did not cause an increase in the frequency of spontaneous his+-revertant mutations., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Nitrosamine by-products in drinking water are designated as probable human carcinogens by the IARC, but the health effects of simultaneous exposure to multiple nitrosamines in drinking water remain unknown. Genotoxicity assays were used to assess the effects of both individual and mixed nitrosamines in finished drinking water produced by a large water treatment plant in Shanghai, China. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were measured at 1, 10-, 100- and 1000-fold actual concentrations by the Ames test, Comet assay, γ-H2AX assay, and the cytokinesis-block micronuclei assay; oxidative stress and the Nrf2 pathway were also assessed. Nitrosamines detected in drinking water included NDMA (36.45 ng/L), NDPA (44.68 ng/L), and NEMA (37.27 ng/L). Treatment with a mixture of the three nitrosamines at 1000-fold actual drinking-water concentration induced a doubling of revertants in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100, DNA and chromosome damage in HepG2 cells, while 1-1000-fold concentrations of compounds applied singly lacked these effects. Treatment with 100- and 1000-fold concentrations increased ROS, GSH, and MDA and decreased SOD activity. Thus, nitrosamine mixtures showed greater genotoxic potential than that of the individual compounds. N-Acetylcysteine protected against the nitrosamine-induced chromosome damage, and Nrf2 pathway activation suggested that oxidative stress played pivotal roles in the genotoxic property of the nitrosamine mixtures., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Mutagenic and genotoxic effects of metolcarb were investigated by both bacterial reverse mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102 strains with or without metabolic activation system (S9) and Allium cepa root meristematic cells, respectively. Metolcarb was dissolved in DMSO in Ames/Salmonella test system. 0.1, 1 and 10 microg/plate doses of metolcarb were found to be mutagenic S. typhimurium TA98 without S9. In Allium root growth inhibition test, EC50 value was determined 200 ppm and 0.5xEC50, EC50 and 2xEC50 concentrations of metolcarb were introduced to onion tuber roots and distilled water used as a negative control. Mitotic index (MI), increased in all concentrations compared to control at each exposure time. While disturbed anaphase-telophase, chromosome laggards, stickiness and bridges were observed in anaphase-telophase cells, pro-metaphase, C-mitosis, polyploidy, binuclear cells and disturbed nucleus were observed in other cells. The results were also analyzed statistically by using SPSS for Windows, Mann-Whitney test and Duncan's multiple range tests were performed respectively., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The Salmonella/microsome assay is the most used assay for the evaluation of air particulate matter (PM) mutagenicity and a positive correlation between strain TA98 responses and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) levels in PM has been found. However, it seems that the major causes of PM mutagenicity in this assay are the nitro and oxy-PAHs. Salmonella YG5161, a 30-times more responsive strain to B[a]P has been developed. To verify if YG5161 strain was sufficiently sensitive to detect mutagenicity associated with B[a]P mutagenicity, PM samples were collected in Brazil and Sweden, extracted with toluene and tested in the Salmonella/microsome microsuspension assay. PAHs and B[a]P were determined and the extracts were tested with YG5161 and its parental strain TA1538. The extracts were also tested with YG1041 and its parental strain TA98. For sensitivity comparisons, we tested B[a]P and 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) using the same conditions. The minimal effective dose of B[a]P was 155 ng/plate for TA1538 and 7 ng/plate for YG5161. Although the maximum tested dose, 10 m(3) /plate containing 9 ng of B[a]P in the case of Brazilian sample, was sufficient to elicit a response in YG5161, mutagenicity was detected at a dose as low as 1 m(3) /plate (0.9 ng). This is probably caused by nitro-compounds that have been shown to be even more potent than B[a]P for YG5161. It seems that the mutagenicity of B[a]P present in PM is not detectable even with the use of YG5161 unless more efficient separation to remove the nitro-compounds from the PAH extract is performed., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The charred surface of fish and beef showed strong mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium test strains when activated by S-9 mix of rat liver. The pyrolysis products of proteins and amino acids were also highly mutagenic. Among the pyrolysis products of amino acids, those of tryptophan, serine, and glutamic acid were most active. The new gamma-carboline derivatives, 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole, were purified from the pyrolysis products of tryptophan. These new compounds were stronger mutagens than aflatoxin B1 towards S. typhimurium TA98, a frameshift type mutant, and they also transformed cryopreserved Syrian hamster embryo cells in vitro. Tryptophan pyrolysate also contained the beta-carboline derivatives, norharman and harman, which are not mutagenic alone, but act as comutagens. A mixture of norharman or harman and nonmutagenic aniline or o-toluidine was strongly mutagenic. The mutagenicities of charred products of other foods, such as seaweed and garlic, are reviewed in this article. Flavonoids, such as kaempferol and quercetin, and glycosides of these flavonoles were mutagenic. The mutagenicity of cooked vegetables depends partly on these flavonoid derivatives. The already-known existence of benzol[a]pyrene and nitroso compounds in cooked food is also reviewed., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Favorable photo-physical properties and high affinity to nucleic acids make new fluorescent cyanine dyes of the SYBR-type particularly useful for DNA and RNA visualization. The growing popularity of SYBR-type dyes is also explained by the fact that removal of the dye from the nucleic acids by ethanol precipitation is more efficient and less time-consuming than the phenol-chloroform extraction applied for the widely used phenanthridine DNA stain, ethidium bromide. To evaluate the safety of nucleic acid staining by SYBR Gold and SYBR Green II we compared the mutagenicity of these compounds, with characteristics corresponding to those of ethidium bromide, by use of the Salmonella/mammalian microsome reverse-mutation assays (Ames test). SYBR Green II and SYBR Gold did not show mutagenicity either in frame-shift or in base-substitution indicator strains, TA98 and TA100, respectively. These results were observed both in the presence and in the absence of supernatant from a rat-liver homogenate S9. Mutagenicity of these stains was not observed although their toxic concentration was reached. Toxic effects of SYBR Green II and SYBR Gold were seen approximately at the same molar concentrations as reported previously for SYBR Green I. As expected, ethidium bromide revealed strong mutagenicity with a maximum increase of 60-fold above the vehicle controls in the frame-shift indicator strain TA98 in the presence of rat-liver S9 extract. Thus, SYBR Gold and SYBR Green II do not show mutagenicity in our tests, even at toxic doses, and these DNA stains represent safer alternatives to ethidium bromide for nucleic acid visualization., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Several mutants with decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were isolated from the sensitive mutagen tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA100 after treatment with u.v. and selection for resistance to N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG) and its methyl analogue MNNG. Estimation of the GSH concentration and GSH S-transferase activity in extracts of these strains and of TA100 indicates that the GSH- derivatives contain 10-30% of the GSH level found in TA100, and that they exhibit normal GSH S-transferase activity. The mutagenic activities of 7 chemicals, namely, MNNG, ENNG, 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE), 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), styrene-7,8-oxide (STOX), N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) were compared in TA100 and in one representative GSH- strain, denominated NG-57. MNNG, ENNG, DBE and CDNB are potent to extremely potent mutagens in TA100, but induce very low levels of His+ mutants in NG-57. Pretreatment of NG-57 with 1 mM GSH (partially) restores the mutant yields to the levels usually found in TA100. The mutagenic activities of STOX, ENU and MMS are similar in both strains. These results support some previous findings, namely that ENNG, MNNG and DBE, but not ENU are activated to mutagens inside the test bacteria, and also suggest that CDNB is activated by bacterial GSH. The latter finding is in contrast with the current view that CDNB is detoxified by GSH, as is also presently evidenced by a strong reduction of the compound's mutagenicity in the presence of extracts of rat liver, which contains GSH and GSH S-transferase activity. The results with STOX indicate that GSH plays in bacteria a much less important role in the detoxification of xenobiotics than in mammalian tissue, presumably due to a much lower GSH S-transferase activity in the first organism., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Solutions of lyophilized preparations of standard black and green tea extracts were made and tested over a range of six concentrations as inhibitors of the mutagenicity caused by the fool mutagen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) in the Salmonella typhimurium TA98 assay containing S9 fraction from rats induced with alpha-naphthoflavone and phenobarbital. Extracts of both black and green tea were equally good inhibitors of mutagenicity. Purified polyphenols were prepared from tea extracts by solvent extraction. The polyphenols of black tea were more potent inhibitors of mutagenicity than the polyphenols of green tea. These findings suggest that black tea may have similar health-promoting properties to those reported previously for green tea., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) has been reported to decrease genotoxicity induced by several mutagens. In this paper, the desmutagenic effect of NAC on a complex mixture, such as diesel extract, has been analyzed. Studies have been carried out in vitro with the Ames test (reverse mutations on TA98, TA100, and TA104 strains) and sister chromatid exchanges assay (SCE) in human lymphocytes. NAC inhibits diesel genotoxicity in both assays. NAC also inhibits the mutagenicity of 1,8-dinitropyrene (1,8-DNP) and 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) known to be present in diesel exhaust and to be activated by cellular O-transacetylases and nitropyrene reductases. NAC inhibits also the induction of SCE in human lymphocytes by diesel extract. These results, and those obtained by the preincubation of NAC with cells, suggest that the inhibition also takes place inside the cell., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Chemical investigation of root bark of Glycosmis pentaphylla and stem bark of Tabernaemontana coronaria led to the isolation of three carbazole alkaloids glycozoline, glycozolidine and methyl carbazole 3-carboxylate, two furoquinoline alkaloids skimmianine and dictamine, an acridone alkaloid arborinine, three monomeric indole alkaloids coronaridine, 10-methoxy coronaridine and tabernaemontanine, and two dimeric indole alkaloids voacamine and tabernaelegantine B. Their structures were established by detailed spectral analysis. Mutagenic and antimutagenic potential of methanol extract of both plant materials were evaluated by Ames test against known positive mutagens 2-aminofluorine, 4-nitro-O-phenylenediamine and sodium azide using Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 bacterial strains both in the presence and absence of S9. Both the extracts were non-mutagenic in nature. Both the extracts of G. pentaphylla and T. coronaria exhibited significant antimutagenic activity against NPD and sodium azide for S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains. The results indicated that the extracts could counteract the mutagenicity induced by different genotoxic compounds., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Reconstituted non-fat dry milk powder, fermented by a mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus CH3 and Lactobacillus bulgaricus 191R to produce yogurt, was freeze-dried and extracted in acetone. After evaporation of the acetone, the extract was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and tested for antimutagenicity. In the Ames test, significant dose-dependent activity was observed against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), 4-nitro-quinoline-N-oxide (4NQO), 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB), 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benz[a]anthracene (DMBA), and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole acetate (Trp-P-2). Weak activity was observed against 1,2,7,8-diepoxyoctane (DEO), and no activity was observed against methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), or aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). In a related assay (Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7), significant antimutagenic activity was detected against MNNG and 4NQO. Activity against the experimental colon carcinogens MNNG and DMAB was examined further, as assayed in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA100). Compounds responsible for both activities were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in DMSO. Adjustment of yogurt pH to 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the amount of anti-MNNG activity recovered. In contrast, extractability of anti-DMAB activity was significantly greater at acidic pH. Conjugated linoleic acid, a known dairy anticarcinogen, failed to inhibit mutagenesis caused by either mutagen, suggesting that other yogurt-derived compound(s) are responsible. Unfermented milk was treated with lactic acid, yogurt bacteria without subsequent growth, or both, to determine if formation of antimutagenic activity required bacterial growth. Extracts of the milk treatments exhibited the same weak antimutagenicity observed in unfermented milk, approximately 2.5-fold less than in the yogurt extracts, suggesting that antimutagenic activity is associated with bacterial growth., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The focus of this research was to develop a better understanding of the pertinent physico-chemical properties of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) that affect genotoxicity, specifically how cellular uptake influences a genotoxic cell response. The genotoxicity of AgNPs was assessed for three potential mechanisms: mutagenicity, clastogenicity and DNA strand-break-based DNA damage. Mutagenicity (reverse mutation assay) was assessed in five bacterial strains of Salmonella typhimurium and Echerichia coli, including TA102 that is sensitive to oxidative DNA damage. AgNPs of all sizes tested (10, 20, 50 and 100nm), along with silver nitrate (AgNO3), were negative for mutagenicity in bacteria. No AgNPs could be identified within the bacteria cells using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), indicating these bacteria lack the ability to actively uptake AgNPs 10nm or larger. Clastogenicity (flow cytometry-based micronucleus assay) and intermediate DNA damage (DNA strand breaks as measured in the Comet assay) were assessed in two mammalian white blood cell lines: Jurkat Clone E6-1 and THP-1. It was observed that micronucleus and Comet assay end points were inversely correlated with AgNP size, with smaller NPs inducing a more genotoxic response. TEM results indicated that AgNPs were confined within intracellular vesicles of mammalian cells and did not penetrate the nucleus. The genotoxicity test results and the effect of AgNO3 controls suggest that silver ions may be the primary, and perhaps only, cause of genotoxicity. Furthermore, since AgNO3 was not mutagenic in the gram-negative bacterial Ames strains tested, the lack of bacterial uptake of the AgNPs may not be the major reason for the lack of genotoxicity observed. , Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The anti-neoplastic agent procarbazine is genetically active in a variety of short term mutagenicity tests, and it also possesses carcinogenic and teratogenic potential. This compound has consistently yielded false negative results in in vitro microbial mutagenicity tests in the presence and absence of mammalian metabolic activation. In this study, procarbazine was not mutagenic in standard and preincubation Ames tests using large S9 concentrations and bacterial test strains devoid of the rfa mutation. The microtitre fluctuation test is a sensitive technique for the detection of bacterial mutagens. Using this assay, procarbazine proved to be a bacterial mutagen after in vitro metabolic activation at concentrations as low as 200 micrograms/ml. Activity was dependent upon liver S9-concentrations which were higher than those usually attained within agar assays, and was only observed when such fractions were derived from aroclor-treated or phenobarbitone plus beta-naphthoflavone treated rat livers. The excision-repair proficient strain E. coli WP2 was equally, if not more, sensitive than the repair deficient strain E. coli WP2 uvrA. Furthermore, the differential mutagenic effects obtained using S. typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1530 and his G46 indicated that the absence of an rfa mutation was essential for procarbazine mutagenesis. Procarbazine was also mutagenic for E. coli D494 in a forward mutation fluctuation assay measuring resistance to ampicillin. In this assay lower concentrations of S9-fraction were sufficient, reflecting the increased sensitivity of the test strain towards the mutagenic metabolites of the drug. In conclusion, the results suggest that rat liver S9-fraction contains only low levels of enzymes capable of activating procarbazine to a mutagen. This may be a result of rapid breakdown during storage, or due to intrinsically low levels in rat liver extracts. Inducing agents appear to increase these levels. The low concentrations of mutagenic species formed in vitro, may only be detectable using a highly sensitive assay such as the microtitre fluctuation test., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Cassia fistula L. (Fabaceae) fruits are highly recommended in folklore medicine for curing various ailments. In the current study, methanol (CaFM), hexane (CaFH), chloroform (CaFCl), ethyl acetate (CaFE), butanol (CaFB) and aqueous (CaFA) fractions of C. fistula fruits were investigated for their potential to inhibit the genotoxicity of mutagens and free radicals. The antimutagenicity of fractions was evaluated against the reactive carcinogenic ester generating mutagen, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) and frame-shift mutation inducing mutagen, 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD) in Ames Salmonella typhimurium TA98 tester strain. Among the fractions, CaFE showed strongest protective effect against the mutagenicity of both S9-dependent and direct-acting mutagen with an inhibitory percentage of 81% and 64% at the concentration of 1 × 10 3  and 2.5 × 10 3  respectively. All the fractions were analyzed for free radical scavenging activity using DPPH, nitric oxide, lipid peroxidation and superoxide anion assays. CaFE fraction showed maximum antioxidant activity in comparison to other fractions with an IC 50  of 97.01, 172.36, 144 and 264.79 μg/ml respectively. High performance liquid chromatography showed the presence of catechin, epicatechin and umbelliferone in appreciable amount which may account for its efficacy in combating free radicals and also showed protective effect against the mutagenicity of S9-dependent mutagen, 2-AF., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Aromatic amines are metabolically activated into mutagenic compounds by both animal and plant systems. The 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NOP) is a well-known direct-acting mutagen whose mutagenic potential can be enhanced by plant metabolism; m-phenylenediamine (m-PDA) is converted to mutagenic products detected by the Salmonella typhimurium TA98 strain, and 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) is the plant-activated promutagen most extensively studied. Plant cells activate both 2-AF and m-PDA into potent mutagens producing DNA frameshift mutations. Coriander (Coriandrum sativum) is a common plant included in the Mexican diet, usually consumed uncooked. The antimutagenic activity of coriander juice against the mutagenic activity of 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine, m-phenylenediamine and 2-aminofluorene was investigated using the Ames reversion mutagenicity assay (his- to his+) with the S. typhimurium TA98 strain as indicator organism. The plant cell/microbe coincubation assay was used as the activating system for aromatic transformation and plant extract interaction. Aqueous crude coriander juice significantly decreased the mutagenicity of metabolized aromatic amines (AA) in the following order: 2-AF (92.43%) > m-PDA (87.14%) > NOP (83.21%). The chlorophyll content in vegetable juice was monitored and its concentration showed a positive correlation with the detected antimutagenic effect. Protein content and peroxidase activity were also determined. The concentration of coriander juice (50-1000 microl/coincubation flask) was neither toxic nor mutagenic. The similar shape of the antimutagenic response curves obtained with coriander juice and chlorophyllin (used as a subrogate molecule of chlorophyll) indicated that comparable mechanisms of mutagenic inhibition could be involved. The negative correlation between chlorophyll content and mutagenic response of the promutagenic and direct-acting used amines allows us to deduce that a chemical interaction takes place between the two molecules, leading to the inactivation of mutagenic moiety., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Ochratoxin A (OTA) was, up to now, believed to be non-mutagenic in the classical Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation test. This was confirmed using rat liver microsomal fractions with the strains, TA1535, TA1538 and TA98, and up to 1210 micrograms/plate, utilizing an Ames microtest. However, using mice kidney microsomal fractions as metabolic activators, reverse mutations were obtained with the three strains used, in the presence of either NADP or arachidonic acid as cofactors. The mutagenicity was higher with arachidonic acid than with NADP using the TA1535 strain. This lends support to the results concerning the DNA or dGMP adducts obtained in vitro which were also higher in the presence of arachidonic acid, and indicate that several metabolic pathways of OTA can lead to genotoxic compounds. In addition, both base pair substitutions and frameshift mutations can be caused by OTA after metabolic activation., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Data from 38 laboratories using 5 strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA1538) were analyzed to determine sources and magnitudes of test data variability. Each laboratory tested the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide by the same protocol, using both its in-house cultures and a set of reference cultures provided to all laboratories. It was found that neither plate-to-plate nor day-to-day variability within a laboratory differed substantially between the in-house and reference cultures for any strain; this indicated no difference in the laboratories' handling of the two cultures. Not surprisingly, on average, plate-to-plate variability was substantially smaller than day-to-day variability within a laboratory, which, in turn, was substantially smaller than inter-laboratory variability. The solvent DMSO was found to have a small (6-7%) but statistically significant depressive effect on the spontaneous mutant frequency for the two plasmid-containing strains, TA98 and TA100, but not for the other three strains. When the mean value and variance of all laboratories for the in-house culture were compared with the corresponding reference culture values for each dose and strain, no major differences were seen. Any increase in mean or variance in the distribution of laboratory means in one of the two cultures could be ascribed largely to a small number of laboratories. Laboratories that reported 'high' or 'low' levels of spontaneous or induced revertants per plate tended to deviate in the same direction for most strains and for both in-house and reference cultures. If 'genetic drift' contributed to the inter-laboratory variability in this collaborative study, it was a minor component that went undetected in our analyses., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Quercetin (QT) and Taxifolin (TF) are structurally similar plant polyphenols. Both have been reported to have therapeutic potential as anti-cancer drugs and antioxidants. Mutagenic effects of QT and TF were evaluated using Salmonella typhimurium TA102 and Escherichia coli WP-2 uvrA tester strains. Either in the presence or absence of S9 mix, QT was mutagenic to TA102 and WP2 uvrA. However, the mutagenicity of QT was significantly enhanced in the presence of S9 mix. Likewise, in the presence of Iron (Fe2+) and NADPH generating system (NGS) and absence of S9 mix, QT induced significantly high mutations in both TA102 and WP-2 uvrA. Mutagenicity of QT decreased in both strains in the presence of Iron (Fe2+) or NGS alone. TF was not mutagenic in the presence or absence of S9 mix in both TA102 and WP-2 uvrA 2, regardless of the presence of iron or NGS. Incorporation of antioxidants (ascorbate, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT)) and/or iron chelators (desferroxamine (DF) and ethylenediamine-tetraacetate (EDTA)) in the test systems markedly decreased QT-induced mutations in both tester strains. These results suggest that QT but not TF, could induce mutations in the presence or absence of rat liver S9 or Iron (Fe2+) and NGS in both tester strains by redox cycling and Fenton reactions to produce oxygen free radicals. Our results indicate that a minor structural variation between the two plant polyphenols could elicit a marked difference in their genotoxicities. These results provide a basis for further study into the potential use of QT in combination with iron supplements., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Improved yields of 5'-nucleotides from yeast extract for food flavouring purposes is possible through use of microbial nucleotidases, which will be available to food processors as the flavour enhancer Aromild. The safety of these enzymes, 5'-phosphodiesterase (RP-1) and the 5'-adenylic deaminase (DN-50000) was investigated in male and female rats. Feeding rats a diet admixed with 500, 2000 and 8000 mg/kg body weight of DN-50000 for 35 days resulted in no significant dose-related changes in body weight, water consumption, urinalysis, haematological profiles, blood chemistry or histopathological profiles of either male or female rats from consumption of the enzyme preparation. There was an increase in the absolute and/or relative organ weights of the submaxillary (salivary) glands in both sexes at 8000 mg/kg. The no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for DN-50000 was clearly evident at 2000 mg/kg. Consumption of RP-1 enzyme for 35 days at dietary levels of 500, 2000 and 8000 mg/kg body weight resulted in no significant changes in the above mentioned parameters, which could be directly attributed to a dose-related effect, with the exception of an increase in the absolute and relative weights of submaxillary glands of both male and female rats in the 2000 and 8000 mg/kg groups. The increase in weight of the submaxillary glands was associated with histological evidence of acinar cell hypertrophy. The NOEL for dietary consumption of RP-1 was clearly evident at 500 mg/kg. In a follow-up study in which rats were gavaged with 2000 mg/kg RP-1, submaxillary gland hypertrophy did not occur. These studies suggest that DN-50000 and RP-1 exert an action on submaxillary glands similar to that which has been previously reported for the enzyme pancreatin. Neither DN-50000 nor RP-1 were mutagenic in the Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA98, TA1537 or Escherichia coli strain WP2uvrA, in the presence or absence of S9 mix., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Four extracts were prepared from the leaves of Nitraria retusa; methanol, ethyl acetate, chloroform and hexane extracts. An assay for the ability of these extracts to prevent mutations induced by various oxidants in Salmonella typhimurium TA102 and TA 104 strains was conducted. These extracts from leaf parts of N. retusa showed no mutagenicity either with or without the metabolic enzyme preparation (microsome fraction). The highest protection against methylmethanesulfonate induced mutagenicity was observed with chloroform and methanol extracts with inhibition percentages of 44.93% (at 50 microg/plate in the presence of TA102 strain) and 38% (at 10 microg/plate in the presence of TA104 strain), respectively. Whereas Hexane and chloroform extracts reduced the mutagenicity induced by 2-aminoanthracene by 83.4% (using the S. typhimurium TA104 assay system) and 65.3% (using the S. typhimurium TA 102 assay system), respectively. Antioxidant activity of N. retusa extracts was determined by the ability of each extract to protect plasmid DNA against strand scission induced by hydroxyl radicals. Chloroform extract exhibited the highest ability to protect plasmid DNA against hydroxyl radical induced DNA damages and exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity, with 0.95mM trolox equivalent when tested by the ferric reducing/antioxidant method., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Glutaraldehyde (GA; CAS no. 111-30-8) has a wide spectrum of industrial, scientific and biomedical applications, with a potential for human exposure particularly in its biocidal applications. The likelihood for genotoxic effects was investigated in vitro and in vivo. A Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation assay showed no evidence for mutagenic activity with strains TA98, TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538, with or without metabolic activation. However, there was a weak mutagenic response (1.9-2.3-fold at the highest non-toxic concentration) with TA100 in the presence of metabolic activation. In a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) forward gene mutation assay (HGPRT locus) there were no consistent, statistically significant, reproducible or dosage-related increases in the frequency of 6-thioguanine resistant cells. There were no reproducible or dosage-related increases in sister chromatid exchanges in an in vitro test in CHO cells. An in vitro cytogenetics study in CHO cells showed no evidence for an increase in chromosomal aberrations on treatment with GA, either in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. In vivo, a mouse peripheral blood micronucleus test showed no increase in micronucleated polychromatophils at sampling times of 30, 48 and 72 h after acute gavage dosing with GA at 40, 80 and 125 mg kg(-1) (corresponding to 25, 50 and 85% of the LD(50)). The absence of an in vivo clastogenic potential was confirmed by no increase in chromosomal aberrations in a rat bone marrow cytogenetics study with sampling at 12, 24 and 48 h after acute gavage dosing with GA (12.5, 30 or 60 mg kg(-1) with males, and 7.5, 20 or 40 mg kg(-1) with females). Thus, in this series of tests, GA produced genotoxic effects in vitro only in a bacterial reverse mutation assay with no evidence for in vivo genotoxicity., Yes: 0.78, No: 0.22\n",
            "Question: Solutions of 2-deoxy-D-ribose and D-ribose were gamma-irradiated under different experimental conditions and tested for mutagenicity, with and without preincubation, in Salmonella typhimurium. The irradiated sugar solutions were mutagenic in the tester strains TA100 and TA98. Except for malonaldehyde (MDA), which is not mutagenic in the concentrations produced radiolytically, the relative mutagenicities of the individual radiolytic products are unknown. With irradiated solutions of 2-deoxy-D-ribose, a relationship was found between the level of non-MDA aldehydes and the mutagenicity in TA100. Heating the irradiated solutions of 2-deoxy-D-ribose resulted in a temperature-dependent reduction of the mutagenicity. Autoclaved, non-irradiated solutions of 2-deoxy-D-ribose were not mutagenic in the Salmonella test., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: We have examined the effects of three buffers--Vogel-Bonner minimal E (VBM) and 0.15 and 0.015 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4--and two concentrations of overnight cells (5x and 10x) on the mutagenicity of two pure compounds and two complex mixtures in strain TA98 using a modification of a microsuspension assay developed by Kado et al. (Mutation Research 121:25-32, 1983). The assay was performed by adding 50 microliters of cell concentrate of an overnight culture of TA98 resuspended in the appropriate buffer; 50 microliters of the same buffer or S9 mix; and 2 microliters of mutagen or dimethyl sulfoxide to a 1-dram vial or 13 x 150-mm test tube. The suspension was incubated for 90 min at 37 degrees C, top agar was added, and the contents poured onto a bottom agar of minimal medium. Cell concentration (5x vs. 10x) had little effect on the mutagenic potencies of the agents tested. The mutagenic potencies of the direct-acting agents (1-nitropyrene and diesel exhaust) were consistently lower with 0.15 M buffer compared to the mutagenic potencies of these agents with the other two buffers. The three buffers gave similar results for the indirect-acting agents (2-aminoanthracene and environmental tobacco smoke). The 0.15 M buffer was considerably cytotoxic in the absence of S9, which may explain why the direct-acting agents were less potent with this buffer compared to the other buffers. VBM was also somewhat cytotoxic, but this did not appear to affect the mutagenic potencies of the agents studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS), Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: 14 pesticides were tested as pure compounds for the induction of point mutations in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium--TA1535, TA1536, TA1537 and TA1538--in the presence and in the absence of rat-liver microsomal fractions and for the induction of resistance to low concentrations of streptomycin in the filamentous bacterium, Streptomyces coelicolor. The technique used was essentially the so-called \"spot test\". The pesticides investigated were: aminotriazole, Benomyl, Captafol, Captan, Dichlorvos, Dalapon-Na, Dinobuton, Dodine, Ioxynil, Mecoprop, Neburon, Picloram, Triallate and Trichlorphon. In Salmonella, Captan and Triallate were mutagenic on the TA1535 strain; Dichlorvos and Trichlorphon were negative in the spot test but mutagenic after incubation in liquid cultures of strain TA1535. By using the S. coelicolor forward-mutation test, aminotriazole, Dichlorvos, Picloram, Trichlorphon and Triallate were mutagenic with the \"spot test\" technique; Captan showed a weak mutagenic activity with a \"plate-incorporated\" technique., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The current study aims to determine the antimutagenic potential of five newly synthesized cyclic compounds against the genotoxic agents sodium azide (NaN₃) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). The mutant bacterial tester strains were NaN₃-sensitive Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 and MNNG-sensitive Escherichia coli WP2uvrA. According to the results, all the test compounds showed significant antimutagenic activity. The inhibition rates ranged from 26.05% (Compound 4-1 µg/plate) to 68.54% (Compound 5-0.01 µg/plate) for NaN₃ and from 32.44% (Compound 3-1 µg/plate) to 60.77% (Compound 5-1 µg/plate) for MNNG genotoxicity. Moreover, the mutagenic potential of the test compounds was investigated using the same strains. The results showed that all the test compounds do not have mutagenic potential on the bacterial strains at the tested concentrations. Thus, the findings of the present study give valuable information about chemical prevention from NaN₃ and MNNG genotoxicity., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The hot water extract of the herbal tea, Gynostemma pentaphyllum Makino, was not found to be mutagenic in Salmonella mutation assay with or without metabolic activation. However, the extract had both DT-diaphorase inducing activity in the murine hepatoma (Hepa1c1c7) cell line and antimutagenic properties towards chemical-induced mutation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. Mutagenicity of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido [1, 2-a: 3', 2', 3-d] imidazole (Glu-P-1), 2-aminodipyrido [1, 2-a: 3', 2', 3-d] imidazole (GIu-P-2), 2-amino-1, 4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido [4, 3-b] indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido [4, 3-b] indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo [4, 5-f] quinoline (IQ) and Benzo [a] pyrene (B[a]P) was inhibited by the extract of Gynostemma pentaphyllum Makino in a dose-dependent manner, but no effect was found on the mutagenic activity of 2-(2-Furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (AF-2). However, the extract enhanced the mutagenicity induced by 2-aminoanthracene (2AA), and N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: 7 epoxide-containing compounds: allylbenzene oxide, styrene oxide, trans-beta-methylstyrene oxide, 4-chlorophenyl glycidyl ether, vinylcyclohexene dioxide, octene dioxide and hexene dioxide were evaluated for mutagenic activity in 4 histidine-requiring strains of Salmonella typhimurium, namely: TA1535, TA100, TA1537 and TA98. These epoxides, except trans-beta-methylstyrene oxide, were mutagenic in TA1535 and TA100 but none of the tested compounds caused mutations in strains TA1537 and TA98. Both the cytosolic (100000 g soluble) and/or microsomal (100000 g pellet) fractions derived from noninduced mouse, guinea pig, and/or rat consistently decreased the mutagenic activity of the 3 most active mutagens: allylbenzene oxide, styrene oxide and 4-chlorophenyl glycidyl ether. This reduction was found to depend on the substrate and the source of the enzyme fraction. Glutathione alone or in combination with the mouse cytosolic fraction resulted in negligible suppression in the mutagenic activity of the 3 epoxides under the conditions reported in this paper. The enzyme(s) in the cytosol responsible for the reduction in mutagenicity co-eluted from gel filtration with the epoxide hydrolase activity. These data are not consistent with the assumption that all epoxide hydrolase activity in an \"S9\" fraction is microsomal., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) are being used increasingly for various industrial and consumer products, including cosmetics and sunscreens because of their photoactive properties. Therefore, the toxicity of TiO2-NPs needs to be thoroughly understood. In the present study, the genotoxicity of 10nm uncoated sphere TiO2-NPs with an anatase crystalline structure, which has been well characterized in a previous study, was assessed using the Salmonella reverse mutation assay (Ames test) and the single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay. For the Ames test, Salmonella strains TA102, TA100, TA1537, TA98 and TA1535 were preincubated with eight different concentrations of the TiO2-NPs for 4 h at 37 °C, ranging from 0 to 4915.2 µg per plate. No mutation induction was found. Analyses with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed that the TiO2-NPs were not able to enter the bacterial cell. For the Comet assay, TK6 cells were treated with 0-200 µg ml(-1) TiO2-NPs for 24 h at 37 °C to detect DNA damage. Although the TK6 cells did take up TiO2-NPs, no significant induction of DNA breakage or oxidative DNA damage was observed in the treated cells using the standard alkaline Comet assay and the endonuclease III (EndoIII) and human 8-hydroxyguanine DNA-glycosylase (hOGG1)-modified Comet assay, respectively. These results suggest that TiO2-NPs are not genotoxic under the conditions of the Ames test and Comet assay., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Dibenzoylmethane (DBM), a structural analogue of curcumin (a bioactive phytochemical present in a widely used spice turmeric) was screened for its inhibitory effect against seven cooked food mutagens (heterocyclic amines): 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1), in both TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium using Ames Salmonella/reversion assay in the presence of Aroclor1254-induced rat liver S9 homogenate. DBM has been reported to antagonize the mutagenicity of several chemical carcinogens in vitro and has recently been shown to be even more effective than curcumin in suppressing the 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumors in rats. But there are no reports regarding its antimutagenic properties against cooked food mutagens. Results of the present investigations clearly indicate that dibenzoylmethane is a very potent antimutagenic agent, that could effectively inhibit mutagenicity induced by all the tested cooked food mutagens in both the frame shift (TA98) as well as the base pair mutation sensitive (TA100) strains of S. typhimurium. These highly potent inhibitory effects of dibenzoylmethane against heterocyclic amines observed in our preliminary investigations strongly warrant further studies of its efficacy as a cancer chemopreventive agent., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Nine hydroperoxy and hydroperoxy-epidioxy oxidation products derived from either autoxidation (AO) or photosensitized oxidation (PO) of methyl linoleate (MLo) or methyl linolenate (MLn) were tested for mutagenic activity by the Salmonella typhimurium his+ reversion assay using strains TA100, TA98, TA102, TA97 and TA1537. All nine oxidation products, monohydroperoxides from AO-MLn (I) or from PO-MLn (II), dihydroperoxides from PO-MLo (III), AO-MLn (IV) or PO-MLn (V), hydroperoxy epidioxides from PO-MLo (VI), AO-MLn (VII) or PO-MLn (VIII) and hydroperoxy bis-epidioxides from PO-MLn (IX), were weakly mutagenic in strains TA97 and/or TA100. The hydroperoxy epidioxides (VI-IX) exhibited significantly greater activity in strain TA97 than did the monohydroperoxides (I, II) or the dihydroperoxides (III-V). In strain TA100, all of the oxidation products tested exhibited similar activity. No major differences between products derived from autoxidized and photooxidized MLn (I v. II, IV v. V, VII v. VIII) were obtained. Rat-liver S-9 reduced the toxicity of all oxidation products to the tester strains. The greatest mutant yields were usually obtained in the presence of S-9, but mutagenic potency was sometimes greater without S-9. The structural feature common to all of the mutagenic oxidation products was the presence of a hydroperoxy group, suggesting that this characteristic is responsible for the observed mutagenicity, either directly or through a common degradative pathway to reactive products of lower molecular weight., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Antimutagenic, anticlastogenic, and bioprotective effect of polysaccharide glucomannan (GM) isolated from Candida utilis was evaluated in four model test systems. The antimutagenic effect of GM against 9-aminoacridine (9-AA)- and sodium azide (NaN3)-induced mutagenicity was revealed in the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97 and TA100, respectively. GM showed anticlastogenic effect against N-nitroso-N'-methylurea (NMU) induced chromosome aberrations in the Vicia sativa assay. The bioprotective effect of GM co-treated with methyl-methane-sulphonate (MMS) was also established in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii repair deficient strains uvs10 and uvs14. The statistically significant antimutagenic potential of GM was not proved against 4-nitro-quinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO)-induced mutagenicity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7 assay. It may be due to bioprotectivity of alpha-mannan and beta-glucan, which are integral part of S. cerevisiae cell walls. Due to the good water solubility, low molecular weight (30 kDa), antimutagenic/anticlastogenic, and bioprotective activity against chemical compounds differing in mode of action, GM appears to be a promising natural protective (antimutagenic) agent., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The activation of dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) to a bacterial mutagen in liver subcellular fraction and in intrasanguinous host-mediated assays was studied, in particular the effect of pretreatment of the animals with ethanol or acetone. Salmonella typhimurium TA 92 was much more sensitive to DMN mutagenicity than TA 100 and TA 1535 or Escherichia coli WP2uvrA and was used for the main part of the study. Noteworthy, in part already known, features of the in vitro activation are the relatively low pH optimum (pH 6-6.4), the non-linear dose-mutagenic response-relationship and the relatively high doses of DMN required for activation with control preparations. Pretreatment of mice with ethanol or acetone greatly reduced the minimal mutagenically effective concentration of DMN in the in vitro assay. Pretreatment with Aroclor 1254, an inducer frequently used in mutagenicity research, showed little effect when used alone, but reduced the potentiation by acetone. The results of the host-mediated assays substantially differed from those of the in vitro activation assays (a) in the relatively low dose of DMN required for mutagenicity to occur and (b) in the lack of potentiation by acetone-or ethanol-pretreatment. Acetone even led to a marginal decrease in mutagenicity. As a possible explantation for this apparent discrepancy were assume that with the in vitro system the activity of the dilute metabolizing system is limiting for the activation of DMN and induction therefore will increase the mutagenicity, whereas in vivo DMN is quantitatively metabolized in both induced and non-induced animals. The results show that caution has to be taken in the interpretation from in vitro results to the in vivo situation. In particular our in vivo experiments do not support the hypothesis that the induction by ethanol of an activating system with a low Km (which would strongly activate traces of DMN ingested with many foods) is one of the reasons for the increased risk of liver tumors in alcoholics., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Polyphenols with antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic properties are present in fruits, vegetables and legumes. In this study, the Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98 and TA100 were used in the microsuspension assay to examine the antimutagenic effect of phenolic compounds extracted from the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) against mutagenicity induced by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). A dose-response curve was constructed for AFB1; from which a level of 40 ng AFB1/tube was selected for all antimutagenicity assays. The AFB1 and phenolic extract (PE) were not toxic to the bacteria at concentrations tested. In the case of PE, results were similar to the number of spontaneous revertants for TA98 and TA100. The inhibitory effect of PE against AFB1 mutagenicity was dose-dependent at the lower concentrations tested (2.5, 5, 10, 12.5, 15 and 25 microgram-equivalent (+)-catechin/tube for TA98; 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 5, 10 and 25 microgram-equivalent (+)-catechin/ tube for TA100). Further, a two-stage incubation procedure was used to investigate the potential interaction between PE and AFB1. The greatest inhibitory effect of the PE on AFB1 mutagenicity occurred when PE and AFB1 were incubated together. When the bacteria were first incubated with PE followed by a second incubation with AFB1, lower inhibition was observed. Lower inhibition was also observed when the bacteria were first incubated with AFB1 followed by a second incubation with PE. The results suggest that the mechanism of inhibition could involve the formation of a chemical complex between of PE and AFB1., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Several pharmaceutical drugs show strong hepatotoxicity during therapeutic use. We have studied 6 of them: aminophenazone, clofibrate, nifuroxazide, oxamniquine, perhexiline maleate, tienilic acid. Their mutagenicity was assessed in the Ames test on 6 strains of Salmonella typhimurium, and in V79 Chinese hamster lung cells using a rat-hepatocyte-mediated metabolic activation system and the HGPRT and Na+/K+ ATPase assay. Nifuroxazide was positive in the Ames test in two Salmonella strains (TA100, and TA100 Fr1). In the hepatocyte-mediated mammalian V79 cell system, nifuroxazide, clofibrate and aminophenazone were negative; oxamniquine and tienilic acid were positive with and without metabolic activation in tests looking for ouabain and 6-thioguanine resistance. Perhexiline maleate was negative for the direct induction of 6-thioguanine resistance without metabolic activation, and positive after metabolisation mediated by primary rat's hepatocytes. These results suggest the need for some caution in the use of some pharmaceutical drugs because of hepatotoxicity and because 3 out of 6 drugs were shown to be slightly mutagenic in mammalian cells., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Chloroform and Bromoform are two abundant trihalomethanes found in Algerian drinking water. The investigation of the mutagenic hazard of these disinfection by-products was studied by Ames test as prokaryotic bioassay to show their mutagenic effects. For this, Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains were employed. Both chloroform and bromoform showed a direct mutagenic effect since the number of revertant colonies gradually increase in dose-dependent manner with all concentrations tested with the two bacterial strains and these were both in the absence and presence of S9 metabolic activation. The genotoxic hazard was also studied by random amplified polymorphic DNA test on the root cells of Allium cepa as eukaryotic bioassay. DNA extracted from the roots of the onion were incubated at different concentrations of chloroform and bromoform and then amplified by polymerase chain reaction. This was based on demonstrating a major effect of disappearance of bands compared to roots incubated in the negative control (distilled water). The results showed that these two compounds affected genomic DNA by breaks although by mutations., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The distribution, DNA adduction and excretion into breast milk of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) were examined in lactating female F344 rats with 5 day old pups. Six hours after a single dose (10 mg/kg, p.o.) of radiolabeled IQ, MeIQx or PhIP to lactating dams, radioactivity in the dams was highest in the liver and kidney followed, in descending order, by the mammary gland, omental fat and brain. By 24 h after carcinogen administration, all tissues of the dams showed significantly reduced levels of radioactivity except for omental fat which changed only marginally from 6 to 24 h. 32P-Postlabeling analysis showed that the level of DNA adducts in mammary gland 6 h after dosing was 2.2, 0.7 and 0.2 adducts/10(7) nucleotides for PhIP, IQ and MeIQx respectively. In contrast, in hepatic DNA, the levels of IQ-DNA adducts (5.5 adducts/10(7) nucleotides) were 11-fold higher than those of PhIP or MeIQx. The stomach contents, liver, kidney and urine of pups nursed by dams given radiolabeled IQ, MeIQx or PhIP were radioactive, indicating that these carcinogens (and/or metabolites) were excreted into breast milk and absorbed by the pups. After a 6 h suckling period, the amount of PhIP-derived radioactivity in the stomach contents of the pups was approximately 10-fold higher than that seen with IQ or MeIQx. Urine from pups from the three groups was mutagenic in the Ames assay with Salmonella TA98 in the presence of an S9 activating system. IQ-, MeIQx- and PhIP-DNA adducts, at levels in the range of 0.25-0.46 adducts per 10(8) nucleotides, were detected in the livers of pups using the 32P-postlabeling method under intensification conditions. The results from this study indicate that breast milk is a route of exposure of the newborn to heterocyclic amines. The presence of DNA adducts in the tissues of pups further suggests that this route of exposure may have a carcinogenic consequence to the newborn., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The ability of fluoroquinolones to cause light-induced adverse effects has been established in experimental studies and clinical observations. The formation of active oxygen species appears to be responsible for this activity. Photomutagenicity tests with bacterial, lower eukaryotic and mammalian cells were performed with three fluoroquinolones (Fleroxacin, Ciprofloxacin and Lomefloxacin). After concomitant irradiation with simulated solar light (with a reduced UVB component), weak increases in the number of revertants were observed in Salmonella typhimurium TA104 and TA100. No photomutagenic activity was detected in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7. In the chromosomal aberration (CA) test with Chinese hamster V79 cells the number of aberrant metaphases was markedly increased. In the Comet assay with mouse lymphoma cells, evidence of extensive DNA breakage was obtained. All three compounds showed similar potencies in the Comet and Ames assays while there was a clear gradation of potencies in the CA assay (Lomefloxacin > Fleroxacin > Ciprofloxacin), which conformed with reports on the relative potencies regarding phototoxicity. The oxygen radical scavengers catalase, superoxide dismutase and N, N'-dimethylurea modulated the photoclastogenicity and phototoxicity but had no influence on the effects in the Comet and Ames tests. It thus appears that different kinds of mechanism are responsible for toxicity and clastogenicity on the one side and DNA breakage and gene mutation on the other side. Pre-irradiation of the test articles did not lead to enhanced genotoxicity, indicating the involvement of very short lived genotoxic agents. The results endorse the advice to avoid excessive light exposure during antibiotic therapy with fluoroquinolones., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The combination of chemical analyses and bioassays allows the identification of potentially mutagenic compounds in different types of samples. Dyes can be considered as emergent contaminants and were detected in waters, under the influence of textile activities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of 9 azo dyes to the mutagenicity of representative environmental samples. Samples were collected along one year in the largest conglomerate of textile industries of Brazil. We analyzed water samples from an important water body, Piracicaba River, upstream and downstream two main discharges, the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the tributary Quilombo River, which receives untreated effluent from local industries. Samples were analyzed using a LC-MS/MS and tested for mutagenicity in the Salmonella/microsome microsuspension assay with TA98 and YG1041. Six dyes were detected in the collected samples, Disperse Blue 291, Disperse Blue 373, Disperse Orange 30, Disperse Red 1, Disperse Violet 93, and Disperse Yellow 3. The most sensitive condition for the detection of the mutagenicity was the strain YG1041 with S9. The concentration of dyes and mutagenicity levels varied along time and the dry season represented the worst condition. Disperse Blue 373 and Disperse Violet 93 were the major contributors to the mutagenicity. We conclude that dyes are contributing for the mutagenicity of Piracicaba River water; and both discharges, WWTP effluent and Quilombo River, increase the mutagenicity of Piracicaba River waters in about 10-fold. The combination of chemical analysis and bioassays were key in the identification the main drivers of the water mutagenicity and allows the selection of priority compounds to be included in monitoring programs as well for the enforcing actions required to protect the water quality for multiple uses., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The present study provides a correlation of the antimutagenic and chemopreventive activity of the barks of two commonly observed plants viz. Acacia auriculiformis and Acacia nilotica. We used the Ames antimutagenicity assay and the mouse mammary gland organ culture (MMOC) model. The plants were extracted with organic solvents to obtain chloroform fractions and acetone extracts. The antimutagenic activity was determined in two different strains using both direct-acting [4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD) or sodium azide] and indirect-acting [2-aminofluorene (2AF)] mutagens. The anticarcinogenic activity was evaluated based on the development of preneoplastic lesions in response to the chemical carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). The results showed that the activity resulting from the 2AF mutagen was selectively greater than the activity from the direct-acting mutagens. Moreover, in general, acetone extracts were more potent in suppressing mutagenesis than the chloroform extracts. The antimutagenicity results obtained with extracts using the 2AF--TA100 system were comparable to the chemopreventive results with DMBA-induced mammary lesions. The order of activity in both tests was A. nilotica > A. auriculiformis. These results exhibited a good correlation between the antimutagenesis assay and the MMOC model, suggesting that these plants may contain active chemopreventive agents., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",

            "Question: Among the various kinds of spices tested, the aqueous extracts of dill weed from Anethum graveolens L. and dill seeds from A. sowa D.C. (Umbelliferae), exhibited a mutagenicity to Salmonella typhimurium, strains TA98 and TA100. The aqueous methanol extracts were fractionated by the mutation assay using the strain TA98 with S-9 Mix. Isorhamnetin 3-sulfate (persicarin) and quercetin 3-sulfate were characterized as the mutagenic principles. Carcinogenicity was not observed for dill weed and seeds when the diets containing these in 33% were administered for 450 and 410 days, respectively, to the inbred strain ACI rats., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The antimutagenic effect of 10 citrus fruit juices was observed against the mutagenicity of N-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD) in TA97a and sodium azide in TA100 tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium using the Ames test. It was noticed that the juices of all these fruits reduced significantly the NPD and sodium azide induced revertant colonies. The inhibitory activity was enhanced if the mutagen and juice were co-incubated for about 30 min at 37 degrees C prior to performing the mutagenicity assay. Dilution with distilled water led to the reduction in the inhibitory activity. The antimutagenic activity of synthetic ascorbic acid or citric acid or combined ascorbic acid and citric acid was also seen. But the results with fruit juices tempted us to believe that in addition to ascorbic acid and citric acid, the presence of other factor(s) possessing antimutagenic properties cannot be ruled out., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The multistage induction theory is generally regarded as the mechanism of carcinogenesis. In order to prevent the initiation stage of carcinogenesis, it is meaningful to discover the functional components of edible plants. The objective of this research was to test the antimutagenicity of the functional components of several typical traditional herbs used in Japan. The traditional herbs, gennoshoko (Geranium nepalense var. thunbergii), yomogi (Artemisia vulgaris var. indica), senburi (Swertia japonica), iwa-tobacco (Conandron ramondioides), sarunokoshikake (Elfvingia applanata), kanzo (Glycyeehiza uralensis Fisch) and matatabi (Actinidia polygama) were examined by Ames mutagenesis assay test with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 against mutagens, Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2 and B(a)P. The water-soluble components or volatile oil of the herbs were extracted in boiling water. The extracts of gennoshoko showed strong antimutagenicity against B(a)P with S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100, as well as Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 with S. typhimurium TA98. Yomogi, senburi and iwa-tobacco were also proved to have good antimutagenicity against Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 with S. typhimurium TA98, but weaker antimutagenicity against B(a)P. Other herbs did not show any obvious antimutagenicity against these mutagens. In addition, the volatile oil of yomogi also had remarkable antimutagenic effect against the mutagens we used with S. typhimurium TA98., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The aim of this study was to explore the potential pro- and anti-mutagenic effects of endogenous bile pigments unconjugated bilirubin (BR), biliverdin (BV) and a synthetic, water soluble conjugate, bilirubin ditaurate (BRT) in the Ames Salmonella test. The bile pigments were tested over a wide concentration range (0.01-2 micromol/plate) in the presence of three bacterial strains (TA98, TA100, TA102). A variety of mutagens including benzo[alpha]pyrene (B[alpha]P), 2,4,7 trinitrofluorenone (TNFone), 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), sodium azide (NaN(3)) and tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH), were used to promote the formation of mutant revertants. Tests were conducted with (B[alpha]P, 2-AF, t-BuOOH) and without (TNFone, NaN(3), t-BuOOH) metabolic activation incorporating the addition of the microsomal liver preparation, S9. The bile pigments alone did not induce mutagenicity in any of the strains tested (p>0.05). Anti-mutagenic effects of the bile pigments were observed in the presence of all mutagens except for NaN(3) and the anti-mutagenic effects appeared independent of the strain tested. For TNFone induced genotoxicity, the order of effectiveness was BR> or =BRT>BV. However, the order was BV> or =BRT> or =BR for 2-AF. Antioxidant testing in the TA102 strain revealed bile pigments could effectively inhibit the genotoxic effect of t-BuOOH induced oxidative stress. The apparent antioxidant and anti-mutagenic behaviour of bile pigments further suggests their presence in biological systems is of possible physiological importance., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Halonitromethanes (HNMs) are a recently identified class of disinfection by-products (DPBs) in drinking water that are mutagenic in Salmonella and potent inducers of DNA strand breaks in mammalian cells. Here we compared the mutagenic potencies of the HNMs to those of their halomethane (HM) homologues by testing all nine HNMs and seven of the nine HMs (minus bromomethane and chloromethane) under the same conditions (the pre-incubation assay) in Salmonella TA100 +/- S9. We also determined the mutation spectra for several DBPs. In the presence of S9, all nine HNMs, but only three HMs, dibromomethane (DBM), dichloromethane (DCM), and bromochloromethane (BCM), were mutagenic. Only two DBPs of each class were mutagenic in the absence of S9. The HNMs were generally more potent mutagens than their HM homologues, and the brominated forms of both classes of DBPs were more mutagenic and cytotoxic than their chlorinated homologues. The HNMs were at least 10 times more cytotoxic than the HMs, and the cytotoxicity rankings in the presence of S9 were similar for the HNMs and the HMs. The addition of a nitro-group to BCM did not change the mutation spectra significantly, with both homologues inducing primarily (55-58%) GC --> AT transitions. The greater cytotoxic and mutagenic activities of the HNMs relative to the HMs are likely due to the greater intrinsic reactivity conferred by the nitro-group. Energy calculations predicted increased reactivity with increasing bromination and greater reactivity of the HNMs versus the HMs (Elumo values were approximately 20 kcal/mol lower for the HNMs compared to their HM homologues). Given that the HNMs also are potent genotoxins in mammalian cells [Environ. Sci. Technol. 38 (2004) 62] and are more mutagenic and 10x more cytotoxic in Salmonella than the HMs, whose levels are regulated in drinking water, further study of their occurrence and potential health effects is warranted., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: In order to identify pigmented corn with nutraceutical potential, the secondary metabolite content, the antioxidant capacity and antimutagenic activity of red, and blue corn were analyzed. The ranges of total phenolic, flavonoid and anthocyanin contents of the corn samples were from 69.4 to 212.8 mg gallic ac. equiv./100 g DW, 0.07 to 12.19 mg (+) catechin eq./100 g DW and 3.89 to 34.17 mg cyanidin-3-O-glucoside eq./100 g DW, respectively. The phenolic extracts demonstrated the highest antioxidant capacity evaluated by the ABTS assay displaying values from 2.06 to 7.34 mmol Trolox/100 g DW. None of the extracts was toxic to the tested bacteria strains TA98 and TA100. For TA98 tester strain, percentage inhibition values against AFB 1  mutagenicity from 61 to 93, and 38 to 75 for flavonoid and anthocyanin extracts were obtained. The total phenol and anthocyanin contents correlate with the observed antioxidant capacity. The most biological active corn samples were the blue color while the least actives were the red ones. The results show that the studied blue corn samples are good sources of antioxidant and antimutagenic compounds, which could use to develop products that contribute to human health., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Development of mutagenicity of five N-nitrosamines (N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine (NDPA), N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) and N-nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPhA)) was investigated during oxidative processes involving UV-photolysis, ozone and OH radicals. The mutagenicity was detected by the Ames test with 3 different strains, TA98, TAMix and YG7108, a strain which is sensitive for N-nitrosamines, in presence and absence of metabolic activation (S9). UV photolysis of mutagenic N-nitrosamines (NDMA, NDEA, NDPA and NPYR) leads to the removal of their specific mutagenic activity as detected in YG7108 in the presence of S9. A formation of mutagens during UV photolysis was detected only in case of NDPhA in the strain TA98. Oxidation products of NDMA, NDEA and NDPhA did not show any significant mutagenicity in the strains used, whereas oxidation of NDPA and NPYR by hydroxyl radicals seems to lead to the formation of direct mutagens (mutagenic in the absence of S9) in YG7108 and TAMix. Oxidation by hydroxyl radicals of N-nitrosamines with chains longer than ethyl can mimic metabolic activation of N-nitrosamines in vivo. , Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The Escherichia coli mu operon was subcloned into a pKK233-2 vector containing rat glutathione S-transferase (GST) 5-5 cDNA and the plasmid thus obtained was introduced into Salmonella typhimurium TA1535. The newly developed strain S.typhimurium NM5004, was found to have 52-fold greater GST activity than the original umu strain S.typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. We compared sensitivities of these two tester strains, NM5004 and TA1535/pSK1002, for induction of umuC gene expression with several dihaloalkanes which are activated or inactivated by GST 5-5 activity. The induction of umuC gene expression by these chemicals was monitored by measuring the cellular beta-galactosidase activity produced by umuC\"lacZ fusion gene in these two tester strains. Ethylene dibromide, 1-bromo-2-chloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and methylene dichloride induced umuC gene expression more strongly in the NM5004 strain than the original strain. 4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine were found to induce umuC gene expression to similar extents in both strains. In the case of 1-nitropyrene and 2-nitrofluorene, however, NM5004 strain showed weaker umuC gene expression responses than the original TA1535/pSK1002 strain. 1,2-Epoxy-3-(4'-nitrophenoxy)propane, a known substrate for GST 5-5, was found to inhibit umuC induction caused by 1-bromo-2-chloroethane. These results indicate that this new tester NM5004 strain expressing a mammalian GST theta class enzyme may be useful for studies of environmental chemicals proposed to be activated or inactivated by GST activity., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: 2-Hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (HNQ; Lawsone; CAS 83-72-7) is the principal natural dye ingredient contained in the leaves of Henna (Lawsonia inermis). Published genotoxicity studies on HNQ suggested it was a weak bacterial mutagen for Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 or was more clearly mutagenic for strain TA 2637, both in the presence of metabolic activation. HNQ was unable to induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster. However, a small increase in micronucleus frequency was reported in the bone marrow of mice at a single mid-range dose level, 24h after intraperitoneal injection. In view of the wide use of Henna hair dyes it was deemed necessary to conduct a thorough investigation, under Good Laboratory Practice conditions, of the genotoxicity of HNQ. HNQ was non-mutagenic in bacterial (Ames test) or mammalian (V79 hprt) assays. It was borderline positive in a mouse lymphoma tk mutation assay and a chromosome aberration test (CHO cells), results that may reflect a similar clastogenic mechanism. Negative in vivo genotoxicity results were noted in the rat hepatocyte in vivo/in vitro UDS test, in peripheral lymphocytes (chromosome aberrations) of rats receiving repeated oral doses of HNQ at the MTD for 28 days, and in mouse and hamster bone marrow chromosome aberration tests. However small, but statistically significant increases in the incidence of bone marrow micronuclei were observed in two out of five tests at 72 h after dosing, but not at 24 or 48 h. There was evidence of haematotoxicity at 72 h, which may have been enhanced by the vehicle (DMSO) used in the positive tests. As erythropoiesis and administration of haematotoxic agents are known to induce small increases in the frequency of bone marrow micronuclei, typically at delayed sampling times, the data suggest that the positive 72 h response produced by HNQ is consistent with stimulation of haematopoiesis subsequent to haematological toxicity of HNQ, and not due to a DNA-reactive mechanism. Overall, the weight of evidence suggests that Henna and HNQ pose no genotoxic risk to the consumer., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Benzophenone (BPs) and 4-Methylbenzylidene Camphor are used as ultraviolet (UV) filters to protect the skin and hair in personal care products. The discharging of the three chemicals may endanger the receiving water ecosystem. In the present study, the mutagenicity of BP-6, BP-8, and 4-Methylbenzylidene Camphor was tested using the Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation test (Ames test) in the system with and without rat liver microsomal preparations (S9). Four S.typhimurium strains, TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA102 were employed in the Ames tests. The mutagenicity was detected from all three chemicals. The addition of S9 increased the mutation ratios of three chemicals to four strains, except BP-6 to TA100 strain and 4-MBC to TA97 and TA98 strain. In the mixed experiment, all positive effects were detected in the absence of S9. However, the results all became negative in the presence of S9. For the mixture of BP-6 and 4-MBC, positive results were detected on four tester strains except for the TA100 strain. For the mixture of BP-6, BP-8, and 4-MBC, positive results were detected on four strains. The mixture test results showed antagonism in mutagenicity for the mixture of BP-6 and 4-MBC to TA98 and TA100 strains and the mixture of BP-6, BP-8, and 4-MBC to TA100 and TA102 strains., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: 4,4'-methylene-bis-(2-chloroaniline) (\"MOCA\") and two identified urinary N-acetyl and N,N'-diacetyl derivatives were tested in a Salmonella/mammalian microsome assay. No mutagenic activity was observed without rat liver S9 mix activation. In the presence of rat liver S9 mix, the chemicals were mutagens, but the mutagenicity of N-acetyl derivatives to strain TA100 was reduced when compared to that of \"MOCA\", and a greater amount of S9 was required to exhibit the mutagenicity of the N,N'-diacetyl-\"MOCA\". These data suggest that N-acetylation does not account for the mutagenic effectiveness of \"MOCA\"., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: An increase in the number of revertant colonies in the Ames test is generally taken as a strong indication of mutagenic activity of a test compound. However, irrelevant positive findings may constitute a major problem in regulatory drug testing. In this study, mixtures containing only amino acids such as glycine, lysine, arginine and isoleucine, routinely used as peptide preservatives in polypeptide pharmaceutical products, were investigated for mutagenesis in the Ames Salmonella typhimurium test. The results demonstrated that in the presence of metabolic activation, all the solutions containing arginine induced an increase in the number of revertant colonies in strains TA98, TA100 and TA1535 compared with the solvent control. More specifically, for strain TA98, all arginine doses tested, i.e. from 0.4 to 8 mg/plate induced a statistically significant increase in the number of revertants. This increase was biologically significant from 1.2 to 8 mg/plate. For strain TA100, the five highest test doses, i.e., from 1.2 to 8 mg/plate, induced statistically and biologically significant increases in the number of revertants. A statistically significant increase in colony number was also observed in strain TA1535, but only at the maximal test dose of 8 mg/plate arginine. These increases were observed with arginine from two different sources, suggesting that the observed effect would not be due to the presence of potential impurities in the type of arginine used. Our findings show that a functional metabolic activation system was required to induce an increase in the number of colonies. The presence of vitamin C inhibited the arginine-induced increase in the number of revertant colonies in S. typhimurium strain TA98, suggesting a potential involvement of oxidative stress., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Terminalia arjuna is an important medicinal plants widely used in the preparation of Ayurvedic formulations used against several ailments. The present investigation was aimed at the fractionation of crude extracts from the bark of T. arjuna in order to isolate and purify the antimutagenic factors present. The antimutagenicity assay was performed to check the modulatory effect of these fractions against NPD, sodium azide, and 2AF, using the Ames Salmonella his+ reversion assay. Most of the phenolic fractions exhibited mutagen specificity against direct-acting mutagens, being effective in suppressing the frameshift mutagen NPD but failing to inhibit sodium azide (base pair substitution)-induced his+ revertants. ET-1 fraction triterpenoid diglycoside showed a marked effect against sodium azide but was ineffective against NPD. In the case of the indirect-acting mutagen 2AF, all the fractions were found to be quite potent in modulating its mutagenicity in both TA98 and TA100 tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium. The results indicate that the bark of T. arjuna harbors constituents with promising antimutagenic/anticarcinogenic potential that should be investigated further., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: We describe here the isolation and identification of palmitic acid as being responsible for significant anti-N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitroguanidine (MNNG) activity in yogurt. The Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA100) was used to direct fractionation of activity. Yogurt was freeze-dried and extracted with acetone to yield a crude extract. The crude extract was purified by normal phase silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, and reversed phase medium pressure liquid chromatographies. The major compound in the active medium pressure liquid chromatographic fractions was determined to be palmitic acid on GC and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems, and by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. Other saturated straight chain and methyl branched fatty acids were detected by GC/MS and were later shown to possess anti-MNNG activity. Of the straight chain fatty acids, palmitic acid had the highest anti-MNNG activity. All omega - 1 methyl branched fatty acids tested were more active than their straight chain counterparts. A trace amount of isopalmitic acid (14-methyl pentadecanoic acid), a minor milk lipid, was detected in one of the active fractions, and was later shown to be five times more active than palmitic acid. Isopalmitic acid also inhibited mutagenesis induced 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4NQO), and 7, 12-dimethyl benz[a]anthracene (DMBA), and was found to inhibit the metabolic activation of DMBA., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: A battery of in vitro short-term tests revealing different genetic end-points was set up in order to study surface-water genotoxicity after disinfection with different biocides: sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)) and peracetic acid (PAA). The surface water both before and after disinfection was concentrated by adsorption on C(18) silica cartridges and the concentrates containing non-volatile organics were divided into different portions for chemical analyses and biological assays. The following in vitro tests were conducted on the water concentrates dissolved in DMSO: the Salmonella mutagenicity assay with S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100; the SOS Chromotest with Escherichia coli, the Microtox and Mutatox assays with Vibrio fischeri; and gene conversion, point mutation and mitochondrial DNA mutability assays with D7 diploid Saccharomices cerevisiae strain. The results show that the SOS Chromotest and the yeast assays are highly sensitive in detecting genotoxicity. The surface-water extracts were very often toxic to most of the test organisms considered, partially masking their potential mutagenic activity. Therefore, the assays with E. coli and with S. cerevisiae are more likely to show a mutagenic effect because these organisms are generally less sensitive to most toxic compounds. Among the tested disinfectants, NaClO and ClO(2) increased water genotoxicity, whereas PAA was able to slightly reduce raw water activity. However, because the organic compounds in the lake water varied with the season of the year, the disinfection processes, at times, both increased and decreased the raw water activity., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: 4,4'-Methylenedianiline and its derivatives were assayed for mutagenicity in the Salmonella/microsomal mutagenicity assay develop by Ames. A specificity to revert strain TA98 suggests a mechanism of frameshift mutagenesis. Liver microsomal preparations (S-9) from rats induced with phenobarbital were most effective for metabolic activation. Alkyl substitution of 4,4'-methylenedianiline did not alter its mutagenic activity; however, substitution of both positions ortho to the amino group eliminated mutagenic activity. Substitution with alkoxy-carbonyl groups eliminated mutagenic activity, whereas halogen substitution (chlorine, fluorine) enhanced the mutagenic activity. The results presented here show the use of structure-activity studies as predictive tools for the assessment of genotoxic properties of industrial chemicals., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The multistage induction theory is generally regarded as the mechanism of carcinogenesis. In order to prevent the initiation stage of carcinogenesis, it is meaningful to discover the functional components of edible plants. The objective of this research was to test the antimutagenicity of the functional components of several typical traditional herbs used in Japan. The traditional herbs, gennoshoko (Geranium nepalense var. thunbergii), yomogi (Artemisia vulgaris var. indica), senburi (Swertia japonica), iwa-tobacco (Conandron ramondioides), sarunokoshikake (Elfvingia applanata), kanzo (Glycyeehiza uralensis Fisch) and matatabi (Actinidia polygama) were examined by Ames mutagenesis assay test with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 against mutagens, Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2 and B(a)P. The water-soluble components or volatile oil of the herbs were extracted in boiling water. The extracts of gennoshoko showed strong antimutagenicity against B(a)P with S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100, as well as Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 with S. typhimurium TA98. Yomogi, senburi and iwa-tobacco were also proved to have good antimutagenicity against Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 with S. typhimurium TA98, but weaker antimutagenicity against B(a)P. Other herbs did not show any obvious antimutagenicity against these mutagens. In addition, the volatile oil of yomogi also had remarkable antimutagenic effect against the mutagens we used with S. typhimurium TA98., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The mutagenicities of 22 mono-nitrobenzene derivatives, i.e., nitrobenzene [98-95-3] and the ortho, meta and para isomers of nitrotoluene [88-72-2, 99-08-1, 99-99-0], nitrophenol [88-75-5, 554-84-7, 100-02-7], nitroanisole [91-23-6, 555-03-3, 100-17-4], nitrochlorobenzene [88-73-3, 121-73-3, 100-00-5], nitrobenzoic acid [552-16-9, 121-92-6, 62-23-7], nitrobenzaldehyde [552-89-6, 99-61-6, 555-16-8] and nitrobenzonitrile [612-24-8, 619-24-9, 619-72-7], were tested with or without S9 mix and norharman [244-63-3] in the Salmonella assay system. None of the compounds was mutagenic without norharman. In the presence of norharman, however, nitrobenzene, nitrotoluene, nitroanisole, nitrochlorobenzene and nitrobenzaldehyde exhibited mutagenicity only to S. typhimurium TA98 with S9 mix. This induction of mutagenesis with norharman was strong for the ortho isomers of every nitro-compound, weak for the para isomers, and was not observed for the meta isomers., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The antimutagenic activity of the methanolic extract of the fruiting bodies of Ganoderma lucidum (Fr.) P. Krast. occurring in South India was investigated. The activity was assayed by Ames Salmonella mutagenicity test using histidine mutants of Salmonella typhimurium tester strains, TA98, TA100 and TA102. The methanolic extract of the mushroom significantly inhibited (P<0.001) the in vitro sodium azide (NaN(3)), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD), and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) induced his(+) revertants in a dose dependent manner. In vivo antimutagenic activity of extract was also assayed by determining the mutagenicity of the urine of rats administrated with B[a]P as a mutagen. The prior administration of extract markedly inhibited mutagenicity induced by B[a]P. The results indicated that the methanolic extract of Ganoderma lucidum occurring in South India possessed significant antimutagenic activity. The effect of B[a]P on hepatic enzymes, such as serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and alkaline phosphtase (ALP), were also evaluated. The extract prevented the increase of SGOT, SGPT, and ALP activities consequent to B[a]P challenge, and enhanced the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). The extract also profoundly inhibited lipid peroxidation induced by B[a]P. The results revealed that Ganoderma lucidum extract restored antioxidant defense and prevented hepatic damage consequent to the challenge by B[a]P., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: A powdered ethanolic extract of  Glycyrrhiza aspera  root exhibits antimutagenic activity against  N -methyl- N -nitrosourea (MNU) based on the Ames assay with  Salmonella typhimurium  TA1535. The aim of this study was to identify the antimutagenic components of the powdered ethanolic extract of  G. aspera  root., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: In spite of its considerable value as a predictor of in vivo genotoxicity and even for carcinogenicity, false positive cases were reported for the Ames test, e.g., with a number of natural food constituents. Here we analyzed the effects of juice of Allium cepa, the common onion, a staple food and traditional remedy used in many civilizations, in the Ames fluctuation assay. We could find mild mutagenicity with an onion juice extract in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100, the latter being less sensitive towards the extract. Mutagenicity was not influenced markedly by the presence of rat liver S9 mix. Onion juice also exerted some toxicity to the bacteria in the same concentration range. Comparative studies with quercetin and rutin, major flavonoid glycosides in onions, revealed a mutagenic potency of quercetin with an EC 50 -value of 4 μM in TA98. The contents of quercetin and rutin in onion juice were determined as 0.71 ± 0.20, and 0.71 ± 0.21 mg/kg. Calculations of quercetin and rutin concentrations in mutagenic dilutions revealed that both compounds are highly unlikely to cause the mutagenic effects of onion juice and that other yet undefined constituents must be responsible for these effects., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Scandix pecten-veneris L. or Shepherd's-needle is a weed species used in some countries for medicinal purposes. In this study S. pecten-veneris leaves were shade dried, powdered and extracted with methanol. The purpose of this study was to assay the in vitro mutagenic, antimutagenic, antioxidant, antilipoxygenase and antimicrobial activities of S. pecten-veneris leaf extract. The methanolic extract indicated no mutagenicity when tested with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. Antimutagenic activity was reported with inhibition of mutagenicity in a concentration dependent fashion. The methanolic extract demonstrated antioxidant activity in the DPPH radical-scavenging test (IC50 = 4.57 mg/mL), comparable to ascorbic acid and BHT. Moreover, the extract presented a remarkable and potent inhibition against soybean lipoxygenase (IC50 = 641.57 µg/mL). The methanolic extract was examined for its antimicrobial powers against four different bacteria with MIC values >100. Our results introduced this plant as a useful factor for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and infectious diseases. , Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Using the Salmonella/microsome assay, the antimutagenic effects of specific components of the extracts from eggplant fruits were investigated. The eggplant fruit juice exhibited an antimutagenic activity against 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) induced mutagenicity. In some of the fractions extracted with several organic solvents (acetone, petroleum ether, ethyl acetate; and methanol), the activity was recognized. No mutagenicity or toxicity for Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of S9 mixture was observed with any of the extracts. It is suggested that there are multiple components of the activities that exist in the eggplant fruit. We isolated lutein from the 84% methanol (methanol/water, v/v) layer, pheophorbide or chlorophyllide from the 70% methanol layer and tannins containing sugar-moieties from the water layer. Pheophytin a and b, Mg-free derivatives of chlorophyll a and b, were isolated from the petroleum ether layer as possible antimutagens. The pheophytin a with S9 mix inhibited by 30-40% the mutagenicity of Trp-P-2., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Dibenzoylmethane (DBM), a structural analogue of curcumin (a bioactive phytochemical present in a widely used spice turmeric) was screened for its inhibitory effect against seven cooked food mutagens (heterocyclic amines): 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1), in both TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium using Ames Salmonella/reversion assay in the presence of Aroclor1254-induced rat liver S9 homogenate. DBM has been reported to antagonize the mutagenicity of several chemical carcinogens in vitro and has recently been shown to be even more effective than curcumin in suppressing the 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumors in rats. But there are no reports regarding its antimutagenic properties against cooked food mutagens. Results of the present investigations clearly indicate that dibenzoylmethane is a very potent antimutagenic agent, that could effectively inhibit mutagenicity induced by all the tested cooked food mutagens in both the frame shift (TA98) as well as the base pair mutation sensitive (TA100) strains of S. typhimurium. These highly potent inhibitory effects of dibenzoylmethane against heterocyclic amines observed in our preliminary investigations strongly warrant further studies of its efficacy as a cancer chemopreventive agent., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The mutagenic and antimutagenic effects of linalool, linalyl acetate and beta-caryophyllene were evaluated by the bacterial reverse mutation assay on Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100, and on Escherichia coli WP2uvrA strains. Neither linalool nor beta-caryophyllene showed mutagenicity, but linalyl acetate induced a statistically significant increase in the number of revertant colonies in WP2uvrA, both with and without S9 mixture. Linalool was devoid of antimutagenic activity against 2-nitrofluorene (2NF), sodium azide (SA), methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) and 2-aminoanthracene (2AA). In contrast, beta-caryophyllene showed a strong antimutagenic activity against 2NF: at the maximum concentration tested (6.40mg/plate) the number of 2NF-induced revertant colonies was reduced by 83.9%. beta-Caryophyllene also showed to counteract the mutagenicity of SA (in TA 100), MMS and 2AA (in WP2uvrA): the effect was weak against SA (inhibition lower than 25%) and moderate against MMS and 2AA (up to 30.5%). The antimutagenic activity of beta-caryophyllene observed here suggests further studies to evaluate its possible chemopreventive properties., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus Stapf) was extracted with 80% ethanol. The extract was not found to be mutagenic in the Salmonella mutation test with or without metabolic activation. However, the extract was found to possess antimutagenic properties towards chemical-induced mutation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. Mutagenicity of AFB1, Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2, Glu-P-1, Glu-P-2, IQ, MNNG and AF-2, was inhibited by the extract of lemon grass in a dose-dependent manner, but no effect was found on the mutagenic activity of benzo[a]pyrene., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Water samples from the Yamuna River at Okhla (Delhi), India, were concentrated using XAD resins (XAD-4 and XAD-8) and liquid-liquid extraction procedures. Gas chromatographic analysis of liquid-liquid extracted water samples revealed the presence of the pesticides DDT, BHC, dieldrin, endosulfan, aldrin, 2,4-D, dimethoate, methyl parathion, and malathion at concentrations of 14, 25, 2.1, 114, 0.9, 0.6, 0.9, 1.7, and 1.9 ng/L, respectively. The genotoxicity of the extracted water samples was evaluated with the Ames Salmonella/mammalian microsome test, DNA repair-defective mutants, and bacteriophage lambda systems. The results of the Salmonella test demonstrated that the XAD-concentrated water samples had maximum mutagenicity with the TA98 strain both with and without metabolic activation. However, the liquid-liquid-extracted water samples were also found to be mutagenic with one or more of the Ames tester strains, but to a lesser extent as compared with XAD extracts. The damage brought about in the DNA repair-defective mutants in the presence of XAD-concentrated water samples was found to be markedly high as compared with that liquid-liquid-extracted water samples at the dose level of 20 microl/mL culture. All mutants invariably exhibited significant declines in their colony-forming units as compared with their isogenic wild-type counterparts. Survival decreased by 86.3 and 75.5% in the polA- strain after 6 h of treatment with XAD-concentrated and liquid-liquid-extracted water samples, respectively. A significant decrease was also observed in the survival of bacteriophage lambda when treated with the test samples. Mutagenic responses of the liquid-liquid-extracted water samples may not necessarily reflect the mutagenicity of existing pesticides in the test water, because some other organic pollutants might accompany the pesticides in the extract., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The mutagenicities of 22 mono-nitrobenzene derivatives, i.e., nitrobenzene [98-95-3] and the ortho, meta and para isomers of nitrotoluene [88-72-2, 99-08-1, 99-99-0], nitrophenol [88-75-5, 554-84-7, 100-02-7], nitroanisole [91-23-6, 555-03-3, 100-17-4], nitrochlorobenzene [88-73-3, 121-73-3, 100-00-5], nitrobenzoic acid [552-16-9, 121-92-6, 62-23-7], nitrobenzaldehyde [552-89-6, 99-61-6, 555-16-8] and nitrobenzonitrile [612-24-8, 619-24-9, 619-72-7], were tested with or without S9 mix and norharman [244-63-3] in the Salmonella assay system. None of the compounds was mutagenic without norharman. In the presence of norharman, however, nitrobenzene, nitrotoluene, nitroanisole, nitrochlorobenzene and nitrobenzaldehyde exhibited mutagenicity only to S. typhimurium TA98 with S9 mix. This induction of mutagenesis with norharman was strong for the ortho isomers of every nitro-compound, weak for the para isomers, and was not observed for the meta isomers., Yes: 0.81, No: 0.19\n",
            "Question: The mutagenic activities of the chlorinated butenoic acids recently identified in chlorinated drinking waters were determined by the Salmonella microsome assay and by the SOS chromotest. The Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA97, TA98 and TA100 were used without and with S9 mix. In the SOS chromotest Escherichia coli PQ37 was used as an indicator organism with and without metabolic activation. In addition, the extremely potent Ames test mutagen (Z)-2-chloro-3-(dichloromethyl)-4-oxobutenoic acid (MX, in the open form), was studied by the micronucleus test with mice using intraperitoneal treatment. The results of the Salmonella assay and the SOS chromotest showed that MX was by far the most potent mutagen of the compounds tested. Mutations were also induced by the reduced form of MX, (Z)-2-chloro-3-(dichloromethyl)-4-hydroxybut-2-enoic acid (red-MX), and by the geometric isomer of MX, (E)-2-chloro-3-(dichloromethyl)-4-oxobutenoic acid (EMX). However, since the solution of EMX contained approximately 5% MX, most of its activity might be attributable to MX. The oxidised form of EMX, (E)-2-chloro-3-(dichloromethyl)-butenedioic acid (ox-EMX), was marginally active in the SOS chromotest only. All these compounds were directly acting mutagens and in the presence of metabolic activation (S9 mix) they did not generate mutagenicity. The oxidised form of MX, (Z)-2-chloro-3-(dichloromethyl)-butenedioic acid (ox-MX), was not mutagenic at the dose levels tested. MX did not induce micronuclei in the bone marrow of mice., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The ajowain (Carum copticum (L.)) is a popular spice and traditionally used in Indian system of medicine. Considering the importance of natural products in modern phytomedicine, the antioxidant and antimutagenic activities of C. copticum fruits extract and its fractions were evaluated. The methanol fraction showed highest antioxidant activity by phosphomolybdenum (2087.7 micromol) and DPPH assay (90.2%) followed by other fractions comparable to ascorbic acid and BHT. Based on antioxidant activity, methanol fraction was evaluated for antimutagenic potential against direct acting mutagens sodium azide (NaN(3)) and methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) and indirect acting mutagens 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) and benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), using Salmonella typhimurium (TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA102) tester strains. The methanolic fraction showed no sign of mutagenicity at tested concentrations (25-100 microg/plate). Antimutagenic activity was recorded with inhibition of mutagenicity ranging from 10.8% to 83.1% in a concentration dependent manner. The phytochemical analysis by IR, HPLC, GC-MS, and total phenolic assay revealed a high content of phenolic terpenoids. Further, characterization of active principle is needed to understand the mechanism of action and therapeutic efficacy in vivo., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Phosmet, the active component of the organophosphorus insecticide Decemtione EK 20, was shown to be mutagenic in the standard Ames Salmonella/mammalian microsome assay in the absence and presence of metabolic activation. It appears to be a direct mutagen inducing base substitution mutations (TA100) as well as a weak frameshift mutagen (TA97). This compound was genotoxic in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7 strain. It significantly increased reverse mutation, mitotic crossing-over and slightly, but not significantly, increased gene conversion at the highest concentration used., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Quercetin-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (isoquercitrin) and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (rutin) are common components of a normal human diet and are increasingly used in food supplements. Here their effect on mutagenesis and immunity is shown., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Several in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that grape extracts could prevent certain steps in carcinogenesis and a few mechanisms have been proposed for this activity. In this study, the potential antimutagenic activity of methanolic and aqueous extracts from two Greek grape varieties of Vitis vinifera against DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed as a potential novel chemopreventive mechanism, using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA102. The two grape varieties were Assyrtiko (white grapes) and Mandilaria (red grapes), while the oxidant mutagens used were bleomycin (BLM) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Since it has been considered that polyphenols present in grapes are their most potent biologically active compounds, we also tested the effects of polyphenol-rich fractions as well as some of the more common grape polyphenols on the activity of the two test mutagens. These polyphenols were quercetin, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, trans-resveratrol, gallic acid and protocatechuic acid. Almost all extracts showed inhibitory activity against both mutagens. On the other hand, polyphenol-rich fractions as well as individual polyphenols at concentrations found in the extracts either did not diminish or did enhance the activity of the mutagens. These results suggest that the protection of DNA from mutations induced by ROS may be one of the mechanisms accounting for the chemopreventive activity of grape extracts. However, it seems that this protective activity may not be attributed to polyphenols but rather to a synergism of many compounds in the grapes., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: A fraction isolated from Terminalia arjuna was studied for its antimutagenic effect against 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD) in TA98, sodium azide in TA100 and 2-aminofluorene (2AF, S9-dependent), a promutagen, in both TA98 and TA 100 tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium using the Ames assay. The fraction inhibited the mutagenicity of 2AF very significantly in both strains while the revertant colonies induced by NPD and sodium azide were reduced moderately. 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, IR and UV-spectroscopic data of the fraction revealed it to be tannin in nature., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Heterocyclic aromatic amines, derived from the pyrolysis of amino acids and proteins, are potent mutagens in the Ames Salmonella assay with rodent liver activation. Additionally, heterocyclic aromatic amines are multipotent carcinogens. We report evidence that these compounds are substrates for the hydroperoxidase activity of prostaglandin H synthase, as measured by alterations in UV/visible spectra, and are bioactivated to macromolecule-reactive species by this enzyme. Indirect electron paramagnetic resonance studies indicate that this activation may occur via a one-electron mechanism. 2-Amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) are direct-acting mutagens in TA98. The mutagenicity of IQ and MeIQ, but not Trp-P-2, were enhanced by activation with ram seminal vesicle microsomes (a rich source of prostaglandin H synthase). Subsequent experiments utilized the newly constructed tester strain TA1538/1,8-DNP6 (pYG 121), which has enhanced arylamine N-acetyltransferase activity. In this strain IQ, MeIQ and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido-[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1) were mutagenic with ram seminal vesicle microsome activation. 3-Amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) was a weak direct-acting mutagen, and was not activated by the ram seminal vesicles (RSV) system. The responses of IQ and MeIQ were markedly enhanced in TA1538/1.8-DNP6 (pYG 121), relative to TA98. These data are consistent with the involvement of prostaglandin H synthase-catalyzed activation in heterocyclic aromatic amine-induced extrahepatic neoplasia., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: By renitrating 3-nitrofluoranthene in the presence of fuming nitric acid, some additional nitro-derivatives were induced; they were identified as 3,7-, 3,9- and 3,4-dinitrofluoranthene (DNF), and two trinitrofluoranthenes (TNF, 3,4,7- and 3,4,8- or 3,4,9-isomers) on the basis of the results of mass spectrometry and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance. The yield of 3,7- and 3,9-DNF was about 61.3% in all of the derivatives induced. All of the DNFs yielded positive results in the rec-assay system, inducing DNA-damaging activity in Bacillus subtilis. Both 3,7- and 3,9-DNF converted Salmonella typhimurium His- strains TA98, TA97 and TA1538 from autotrophy to prototrophy, indicating a frameshift-type mutation for both; for strain TA98, 3,7-, 3,9- and 3,4-DNF gave mutagenicity of 422, 355 and 15.5 His+ revertants, respectively, per nanogram, corresponding to the specific activity of 1,6-dinitropyrene (DNP), a powerful mutagen. These DNFs are known to be potential mutagens which are eluted at adjacent retention times with 1,3-, 1,6- and 1,8-DNP on a column for high-performance liquid chromatography., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Nitrated derivatives of the aza-arenes carbazole and 2-hydroxycarbazole were synthesized and tested for mutagenicity in the Ames plate-incorporation assay. 3,6-Dinitrocarbazole was the most mutagenic towards Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 (> 100 revertants/micrograms, 25 revertants/nmol, with or without S9) followed by 2-hydroxy-1,3,6-trinitrocarbazole (24 revertants/micrograms, 7 revertants/nmol without S9) and 2-hydroxy-3-nitrocarbazole (27 revertants/micrograms, 6 revertants/nmol without S9). 2-Hydroxy-1,3-dinitrocarbazole, 1,6-dinitrocarbazole, 3-nitrocarbazole and 1-nitrocarbazole ranged from moderately to weakly active (7-1 revertants/micrograms, 2-0.3 revertants/nmol without S9). Carbazole and 2-hydroxycarbazole, and 2-hydroxy-1-nitrocarbazole, were quite inactive. Activity was generally decreased by the presence of S9, except for the dinitrocarbazoles, and was also lower in the variant TA98NR, indicating that mutagenicity was largely dependent on the presence of the 'classical' bacterial nitroreductase. The relative activities of these compounds are consistent with the hypothesis that structural features (orientation of the nitro group relative to the plane and to the long axis of the molecule, and ability to resonance-stabilize the positive charge on the arylnitrenium active electrophile intermediate) are major influences determining mutagenic potency of nitrated compounds., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The mutagenicities of 15 naturally occurring anthraquinones were examined in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100 and TA2637 by the preincubation method. 7 of the 15 compounds tested, i.e., chrysazin, emodin, islandicin, alizarin, chrysophanol, 2-hydroxyanthraquinone and emodic acid, were strong mutagens in strain TA2637 with metabolic activation. All of these compounds contain 1-3 hydroxyl groups, and some also have methyl groups. Cynodontin, an anthraquinone with 4 hydroxyl groups and 1 methyl group, was only slightly mutagenic in strain TA2637. 2-Hydroxyanthraquinone, alizarin, emodin, islandicin and chrysazin were also mutagenic in strain TA100 with S9 mix. All the bisanthraquinones tested, i.e., skyrin, (+)rugulosin, (-)luteoskyrin, (-)rubroskyrin and sennoside A, were non-mutagenic in this test system with or without metabolic activation. Unsubstituted anthraquinone and anthrone were also non-mutagenic. These results show that hydroxyl substituents are necessary for the mutagenicity of anthraquinones, the optimal substitutions being 1-3 hydroxyl groups per molecule. The 4th hydroxyl group, in the compound cynodontin reduces the mutagenicity considerably., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The effect of highly purified rat liver cytosolic NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase [EC 1.6.99.2] on the mutagenicity of 1,3- 1,6- and 1,8-dinitropyrene (DNP) was studied in the Ames Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay. NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase over the range of 0.02-0.8 micrograms/plate (38-1500) units increased up to threefold the mutagenicity of all three DNPs in S. typhimurium TA 98. In TA98NR, a strain deficient in \"classical\" nitro-reductase, the mutagenicity of 1,6- and 1,8-DNP was essentially unchanged, whereas that of 1,3-DNP was markedly reduced. NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase enhanced the mutagenicity of 1,6- and 1,8-DNP to approximately equivalent extents in TA98NR and TA98. The mutagenicity of 1,3-DNP in TA98NR was potently enhanced by the addition of NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase in a dose-responsive manner. In the presence of 0.8 micrograms NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase, 1,3-DNP displayed a mutagenic response in TA98NR that was comparable to that obtained in TA98. NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase was found to increase the mutagenicity of 1,6- but not 1,3- or 1,8-DNP to mutagenic intermediates in TA98/1,8-DNP6, a strain deficient in O-acetyltransferase activity. The results suggest that NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase not only catalyzes reduction of the parent DNP but also that of partially reduced metabolites generated from that DNP. Such reductive metabolism may lead to increased formation of the penultimate mutagenic species., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Paper strips containing indicator dyes have been developed by defence scientists to change color upon exposure to certain agents but not to common solvents. As a preliminary step in studies on their possible genetic or carcinogenic hazard, 6 dyes used in these detection papers were tested with the Salmonella/mammalian-microsome assay. The 3 nitro arenes tested were found to be mutagenic. Two of them, Orasol Navy Blue 2RB (without metabolic activation) and Eastman Fast Blue B-GLF (with metabolic activation), induced higher yields of mutations in the frameshift revertible strains, but base substitution mutations also were found. The third nitro arene, ethyl-bis-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) acetate, induced only frameshift reversions, the greatest yields without metabolic activation. Because of weak but consistent mutagenic activation. Because of weak but consistent mutagenic effects with a fourth dye, thiodiphenyl-4,4'-diazo-bis-salicylic acid, fluctuation tests using Salmonella strain TA98 were performed, and dose-related, statistically-significant mutagenic responses were observed. Two remaining dyes, Fluorescent Brilliant Yellow R and 2,5,2',5'-tetramethyltriphenylmethane-4,4'-diazo-bis-beta-hydroxynaphthoic anilide, were not mutagenic in experiments using doses extending into the toxic range. Spot tests were performed on different paper strips containing the dyes. When the papers were eluted with dimethyl sulfoxide, responses were found to be qualitatively similar to those in the plate tests. Although microbial test results cannot be used to assess risk in man, these results indicate a potential mutagenic or carcinogenic hazard for individuals exposed to these dyes, especially the nitro aromatics., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Recently we have shown that Salmonella typhimurium tester strains have high levels of the tripeptide glutathione (GSH) and activity of GSH S-transferases (Summer et al., 1979). In continuation of the GSH-dependent suppression of mutagenicity of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene in presence of S9 fraction (Summer et al., 1979), this paper is focused on the GSH-dependent detoxifying capacity of the bacterial tester strains. 1-Fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (FDNB), an electrophilic agent, which is used to identify terminal amino acids in proteins (Sanger reagent), readily reacts with GSH leading to a dose-dependent  depletion of bacterial GSH. Additionally, FDNB is a strong mutagen for Salmonella typhimurium TA100, TA1538, and TA98 without metabolic activation. Presumably owing to conjugation with bacterial GHS, FDNB in concentrations which were lower or equal to those of bacterial GSH were found to be not mutagenic. Accordingly, increasing amounts of bacteria in the test system require increasing amounts of FDNB for expression of mutagenicity., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Chloracetophone (O,O-dimethyl-2,2,2-trichloro-1-(chloroacetoxy)phosphonate), a new insecticide of the organophosphorus group of pesticides, was tested for genotoxicity in a variety of systems with different genetic end-points and varying parameters. The test systems included 2 microbial systems, Salmonella and Aspergillus for point mutations and mitotic segregation, respectively, and human lymphocyte cultures and mammalian bone marrow cells (from rats and hamsters treated acutely and subacutely) for chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei. Chloracetophone was negative in Aspergillus at concentrations of 1-500 micrograms/ml, in human lymphocyte cultures at concentrations of 2.5-40 micrograms/ml, in rats at doses of 420-21 mg/kg b.w. and in hamsters at doses of 210-42 mg/kg b.w. for chromosomal aberrations. It did not cause any increase of micronuclei in human lymphocytes and rat bone marrow cells but did cause a significant increase in hamster bone marrow cells. Chloracetophone induced base-pair substitutions in strain TA100 of Salmonella with and without metabolic activation at a concentration range of 2000-6000 micrograms/plate., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: 22 arylmethane dyes which have been used as food colours, commercial dyes, laboratory stains and pH indicators were tested in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity assay. 8 mutagenic dyes were identified, including 5 food colours and 3 common laboratory strains; none of the 11 indicator dyes tested was mutagenic. The commercial and laboratory dyes Methyl Violet 2B C.I. 42535 and Crystal Violet C.I. 42555 were mutagenic in base-pair substitution mutation detector strain TA1535 in the absence of metabolic activation. By contrast, the food colours Benzyl Violet 4B C.I. 42640, Guinea Green B.C.I. 42085, Light Green SF C.I. 42095, Lissamine Green B C.I. 44090 and Violet BNP C.I. 42581 and the bacteriological stain, Basic Fuchsin C.I. 42500-42510, were all mutagenic in frameshift mutation detector strains TA98 and/or TA1538 and required metabolic activation. Most of these compounds gave weak mutagenic responses with Salmonella and were positive only within narrow dose ranges. Since conflicting results were obtained using dyes from different sources, minor dye components may have been responsible for their mutagenicity. This suggests the need to improve knowledge about impurities in arylmethane colours still used in food and to review the toxicological role of such impurities., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Mouriri pusa Gardner and Mouriri elliptica Martius are fruit-bearing plants of the Melastomataceae family, popularly known in Brazil as puçá-preto or jaboticaba-do-cerrado, and they are used in folk medicine for the treatment of gastric ulcers. In this study, we employ the Ames test to assess the mutagenicity of compounds obtained from the leaves of these species. The methanol extract of the M. pusa was mutagenic to the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA97a and TA100, with or without metabolic activation. The methanol extract of M. elliptica induced mutagenic activity in TA98 when metabolized with S9 fraction and TA97a with and without S9, but with lower mutagenicity index (MI) and potencies values than those for M. pusa. Enriched fractions of flavonoids and tannins of M. pusa were also evaluated and they demonstrated positive mutagenicity. The highest values of MI and potency were obtained with the flavonoid fraction, which contains large amounts of quercetin, quercetin glycosides and myricetin. These compounds are probably related to the mutagenicity observed in the Ames test. The dichloromethane extract was not mutagenic in any of the test conditions employed., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The MeOH extract of Pueraria thunbergiana (Leguminosae) flowers and its fractions were subjected to Ames test to test the antimutagenicity. EtOAc fraction (1 mg/plate) decreased the number of revertants of Salmonella typhymurium TA100 by 95% against aflatoxin B, (AFB1). Phytochemical isolation of the EtOAc fraction afforded four isoflavonoids (tectorigenin, glycitein, tectoridin and glycitin) and one saponin (kaikasaponin III). Though the three isoflavonoids other than tectoridin showed significant antimutagenicity, the activity of kaikasaponin III was the most potent. Kaikasaponin III (1 mg/plate) decreased the number of revertants of S. typhymurium TA100 by 99% against AFB, but by 75% against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Tectorigenin (1 mg/plate) inhibited the AFB1-induced mutagenicity by 90% and MNNG-induced one by 76%. Glycitein and glycitin were less active than tectorigenin and kaikasaponin III. This result suggested that kaikasponin III prevents the metabolic activation of AFB1 and scavenge electrophilic intermediate capable of mutation. The two components with potent activities, tectorigenin and kaikasaonin III, significantly prevented the malondialdehyde formation caused by bromobenzene in the rat., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: In this article, the genotoxic and antigenotoxic effects of methanol extract of of Cladonia foliacea (Huds.) Willd. (CME) were studied using WP2, Ames (TA1535 and TA1537), and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test systems. The results of our studies showed that 5 µM concentration of aflatoxin B1(AFB1) changed the frequencies of SCE and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. When 5 and 10 µg/mL concentrations of CME was added to AFB1, the frequencies of SCE and MDA level were decreased and SOD, GSH, and GPx levels were increased. The extract CME did not show any mutagenicity on Ames (Salmonella typhimurium TA1535, TA1537) and WP2 (Escherichia coli) test systems. On the other hand, CME has antimutagenicity on the mentioned test systems. The results of this experiment have clearly shown that CME has a significant antioxidative and antigenotoxic effect, which is thought to be due to the antigenotoxic activities of antioxidant enzymes., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Nitrilotriacetic acid trisodium salt (NTA), which is a substitute for polyphosphates in household laundry detergents, and N-nitrosoiminodiacetic acid (NIDA), a derivative of NTA produced by metabolism of soil microorganisms, were tested for in vitro mutagenicity in bacteria and yeasts. No gene reversions in five strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA 1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98, and TA100), no forward gene mutations in Schizosaccharomyces pombe P1, and no mitotic gene conversions at two loci in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D4 were induced by NTA (up to 870 micrograms/plate or 40 micrograms/ml) and NIDA (up to 2,000 micrograms/plate or 1,000 micrograms/ml), independently of the presence of rat liver metabolic activation. The influence of NTA on the mutagenic and clastogenic activity of several chromium compounds was examined in the Salmonella/microsome assay and in the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assay in mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster ovary [CHO] line). NTA does not affect the genetic inactivity of water-soluble Cr(III) (Cr2[SO4]3) and the direct mutagenicity of soluble Cr(VI) (Na2CrO4,K2Cr2O7) compounds. The very insoluble Cr(VI) compounds PbCrO4 and PbCrO4 X PbO are instead clearly mutagenic in the Salmonella/microsome assay (TA100 strain) only in the presence of NTA or NaOH. The mutagenicity of lead chromates is correlated with the amounts of Cr(VI) solubilized by NTA or alkali, as detected by the colorimetric reaction with diphenylcarbazide and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. In the SCE assay, the insoluble lead chromates are directly clastogenic owing to prolonged treatment conditions and cellular endocytosis. The chromosome-damaging activity of PbCrO4 is significantly increased by NTA but not by NaOH., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: A series of naturally occurring compounds were tested for the ability to modulate the mutagenicity induced by cigarette smoke (CS), cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) and benzo[a]pyrene (BP) in the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay and the micronucleus test in mouse bone marrow. Sodium selenite, retinol acetate and alpha-tocopherol significantly decreased the mutagenic activity of CS in Salmonella typhimurium TA98. Ascorbic acid, reduced glutathione (GSH), cysteine, caffeine, theophylline, cobalt chloride, folic acid, adenine, adenosine, guanosine, cytidine and cytosine were conversely devoid of any significant effect. Sodium selenite slightly decreased the mutagenic activity of CSC in the same bacterial strain, while caffeine was ineffective and ascorbic acid potentiated its mutagenicity. Ascorbic acid inhibited the mutagenic activity of BP in S. typhimurium TA98, but not in TA100. Retinol acetate diminished the number of BP-induced his+ revertants in TA98 but only at the highest concentrations used, whereas alpha-tocopherol, GSH, cysteine, sodium selenite and caffeine had no effect. Selenite and GSH, which were ineffective when applied individually, inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the BP-induced mutagenesis in S. typhimurium TA98 when simultaneously added to the top agar. All other combinations tested, including selenite plus either GSH, cysteine or caffeine towards CS or CSC, or selenite plus cysteine, or selenite plus retinol acetate and alpha-tocopherol towards BP, failed to produce interactive effects. Sodium selenite and caffeine, given either alone or in combination in drinking water, did not influence the clastogenesis induced in mouse bone marrow by a single treatment with CS or BP. Ascorbic acid was also ineffective towards CS clastogenicity but significantly decreased the number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes induced by BP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS), Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Sulforaphane, a constituent of broccoli was investigated for its antimutagenic potential against different classes of cooked food mutagens (heterocyclic amines). These include imidazoazaarenes such as 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP); pyridoindole derivatives such as 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2); and, dipyridoimidazole derivative such as 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1). Tests were carried out by Ames Salmonella/reversion assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 (frame shift mutation sensitive) and TA100 (base pair mutation sensitive) bacterial strains in the presence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver S9. Results of these in vitro antimutagenicity studies strongly suggest that sulforaphane is a potent inhibitor of the mutagenicity induced by imidazoazaarenes such as IQ, MeIQ and MeIQx (approximately 60% inhibition) and moderately active against pyridoindole derivatives such as Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 (32-48% inhibition), but ineffective against dipyridoimidazole derivative (Glu-P-1) in TA 100., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Antimutagenic activities of hexane extracts obtained from the fruit extract (UE) and the Kernels (KE) of P. mume were examined. These extracts showed inhibitory activities to known mutagens, 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide, benzo[alpha]pyrene and aflatoxin B1 in the Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98 strains. The UE and KE fractions were then separated by silicic acid column chromatography with a stepwise elution method using ether-hexane. The location of the active substances in the fractions was also determined by thin-layer chromatography. Consequently, it was found that the effective substances for the desmutagenicity were fatty acids, and identified by gas liquid chromatography, mainly as oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid in UE, and mainly as oleic acid and linoleic acid in KE, respectively., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The presence and inducibility of CYP1A1 in freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes was examined in untreated rats and in rats pretreated with agents known to induce the enzyme in other tissues, as well as dexamethasone [CAS #50-02-2], which is not commonly associated with CYP1A1 induction. CYP1A1 but not CYP1A2 was detected by Western blot analysis of lymphocytes from untreated rats and was induced in lymphocytes from rats treated with the known CYP1A inducers beta-naphthoflavone [CAS #6051-87-2] or 3-methylcholanthrene [CAS #56-49-5] (7.3-fold), cigarette smoke (2. 8-fold), and pyridine [CAS #108-86-1] (2.6-fold). CYP1A1 was also induced in lymphocytes from rats treated with the nonprototypic inducer dexamethasone (17.7-fold) or bromobenzene [CAS #108-86-1] (3. 9-fold). Lymphocyte homogenate from rats treated with the inducers also catalyzed NADPH-dependent bioactivation of benzo[a]pyrene [CAS #50-32-8] to mutagens. The benzo(a)pyrene mutagenicity was detected using Salmonella typhimurium TA100 in the Ames test, and correlated positively with lymphocyte CYP1A1 content. The data show that CYP1A1 is present in rat peripheral blood lymphocytes in vivo, and is inducible by prototypic, as well as nonprototypic, inducers of the enzyme., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Extensive production and consumption of nanomaterials such as ZnO and TiO(2) has increased their release and disposal into the environment. The accumulation of nanoparticles (NPs) in ecosystem is likely to pose threat to non-specific targets such as bacteria. The present study explored the effect of ZnO and TiO(2) NPs in a model bacterium, Salmonella typhimurium. The uptake of ZnO and TiO(2) bare NPs in nano range without agglomeration was observed in S. typhimurium. TEM analysis demonstrated the internalization and uniform distribution of NPs inside the cells. Flow cytometry data also demonstrates that both ZnO and TiO(2) NPs were significantly internalized in the S. typhimurium cells in a concentration dependent manner. A significant increase in uptake was observed in the S. typhimurium treated even with 8 and 80 ng mL(-1) of ZnO and TiO(2) NPs with S9 after 60 min, possibly the formation of micelles or protein coat facilitated entry of NPs. These NPs exhibited weak mutagenic potential in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA1537 and Escherichia coli (WP2uvrA) of Ames test underscoring the possible carcinogenic potential similar to certain mutagenic chemicals. Our study reiterates the need for re-evaluating environmental toxicity of ZnO and TiO(2) NPs presumably considered safe in environment., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: TNT was mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium without the need of a rat liver metabolic activation system (S9). The mutagenic potency of TNT decreased in proportion to the number of nitro groups that were reduced to the amino form. The presence of a nitro group on the 4 position of the diamino congener is necessary for mutagenicity. Among the active congeners, mutagenicity was generally greater for TA100 than TA98, except that for the 4-amino congener the reverse was true. In cases when S9 was included in the assay, there was always a decrease in the number of mutants induced as compared with those without S9. Tetryl behaved like TNT, except that it was approximately three times more potent. RDX and HMX were not mutagenic under the conditions of the assay. When TNT was composed, the major metabolites identified in organic extracts of compost samples were the 2-amino and 4-amino congeners. An acetonitrile extract of compost was tested and found to be more mutagenic for TA98 than TA100, much like the authentic 4-amino congener, but the amount of this congener in the extract did not account for the degree of mutagenicity., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Acetaminophen (APAP), aspirin (ASA), phenacetin (PA) and ibuprofen (IB) were tested for mutagenic activity in the Ames Salmonella plate incorporation assay using strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538. These analgesics were tested in four separate tests: without metabolic activation, and in the presence of a rat, hamster or mouse liver post-mitochondrial supernatant (S-9, Aroclor 1254-induced). Treatment of all five strains of Salmonella with APAP, ASA or IB under all four metabolic conditions did not induce any appreciable increases in revertant colony counts, as compared to the negative controls. A dose-related increase in revertant colony counts, reaching levels twice the negative control values, were seen with PA at doses greater than or equal to 500 micrograms per plate. This response was only seen in strain TA100 in the presence of hamster S-9. Therefore, these findings constitute a positive result for PA in the Ames test. APAP, ASA and IB did not show any mutagenic potential under these conditions of testing. These findings are discussed along with previously published results concerning the genotoxicity of these analgesics., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The implications of disinfection by-products (DBPs) present in drinking water are of public health concern because of their potential mutagenic, carcinogenic and other toxic effects on humans. In this study, we selected 13 main DBPs found in drinking water to quantitatively analyse their cytotoxicity and genotoxicity using a microplate-based cytotoxicity assay and a developed SOS/umu assay in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. With the developed SOS/umu test, eight DBPs: 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2[5H]-fura3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2-[5H]-furanone (MX), dibromoacetonitrile (DBN), iodoacetic acid (IA), bromochloroacetonitrile (BCN), bromoacetic acid (BA), trichloroacetonitrile (TCN), dibromoacetic acid (DBA) and dichloroacetic acid (DCA) were significantly genotoxic to S. typhimurium. Three DBPs: chloroacetic acid (CA), trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and dichloroacetonitrile (DCN) were weakly genotoxic, whereas the remaining DBPs: chloroacetonitrile (CN) and chloral hydrate (CH) were negative. The rank order in decreasing genotoxicity was as follows: MX > DBN > IA > BCN > BA > TCN > DBA > DCA > CA, TCA, DCN > CN, CH. MX was approximately 370 000 times more genotoxic than DCA. In the microplate-based cytotoxicity assay, cytotoxic potencies of the 13 DBPs were compared and ranked in decreasing order as follows: MX > IA > DBN > BCN > BA > TCN > DCN > CA > DCA > DBA > CN > TCA > CH. MX was approximately 19 200 times more cytotoxic than CH. A statistically significant correlation was found between cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the 13 DBPs in S. typhimurium. Results suggest that microplate-based cytotoxicity assay and the developed SOS/umu assay are feasible tools for analysing the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of DBPs, particularly for comparing their toxic intensities quantitatively., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: 1-Nitropyrene (1-NP) is a mutagenic nitro compound in the environment. We studied correlations between the mutagenicity of 1-NP for three strains of Salmonella typhimurium, the activity of bacterial nitroreductases and the amount of 1-NP-derived DNA adducts. Bacterial strains used in this study were S. typhimurium strains TA98, nitroreductase-less mutant TA98NR and YG1021 carrying a nitroreductase-producing plasmid. The mutagenicity of 1-NP was measured using the Ames assay, and the nitroreductase activities of these strains were assayed by quantification of 1-aminopyrene produced from 1-NP. The DNA adducts were measured by the 32P-postlabeling method. Among the three bacterial strains, strain YG1021 was the highest in mutagenicity of 1-NP, the nitroreductase activity and the DNA adduct level. However, S. typhimurium strain TA98NR had the lowest values of these three parameters. Nitroreductase activity, DNA adduct level and mutagenicity were strongly correlated with each other. These results indicate that bacterial nitroreductase plays an important role in forming the DNA adducts, and that the higher the adduct level the higher the level of mutagenicity., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Metabolic activation of the food mutagens 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) and aflatoxin B1 by female BALB/c mice of different ages (2-24 weeks) was investigated in vivo and in vitro using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 as the indicator organism. The in vivo activation of the three mutagens was investigated in 4- and 24-week-old mice using an intrasanguineous host-mediated assay. All three compounds showed reduced levels of activation with the older hosts. Hepatic S9 fractions from female mice of varying ages between 2 and 24 weeks were used in the in vitro mutagenicity assay. To achieve optimal activation to bacterial mutagens, 5% S9 was required for aflatoxin B1 and Trp-P-2 and 10% S9 for MeIQ; age of donor generally had little effect on the profile of these protein activation curves. Under these optimal conditions MeIQ and Trp-P-2 both exhibited, as before, age-dependent decreases in activation over a wide range of mutagen concentrations, however the in vitro activation of aflatoxin showed no consistent change with age. Spectrophotometric measurements of S9 cytochrome P-450 content showed a decrease in concentration with increasing age, but this was not sufficient to account for changes observed in hepatic mutagen activation. However, changes in the activities of certain cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes and cytosolic GSH-transferases, which in turn result in changes in the activation and detoxification capacity of the liver, would appear to explain age-dependent changes in the activity of mutagens in vivo., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The high diversity of species in the marine environment gives rise to compounds with unique structural patterns not found as natural products in other systems and with great potential for pharmacological, cosmetic and nutritional use. The genus Tubastraea (Class Anthozoa, Order Scleractinia, Family Dendrophylliidae) is characterized as a hard coral without the presence of zooxanthellae. In species of this genus alkaloids derived from the compound aplysinopsin with pharmacological activity are known. In Brazil T. coccinea and T. tagusensis are characterized as non-indigenous and invasive and are currently found along the Brazilian coast, from Santa Catarina to Bahia states. This study aims to analyze the mutagenic, cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of methanolic and ethanolic extracts from T. coccinea and T. tagusensis collected in Ilha Grande Bay, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Bacterial reverse mutation assay on the standard strains TA97, TA98, TA100, TA102 and TA104, in vitro micronucleus formation test and colorimetric assays for cytotoxic signals on the cell lines HepG2 and RAW264.7 were used. We also synthesized an oxoaplysinopsin derivate alkaloid (APL01) for comparative purposes. No mutagenic (250; 312.5; 375; 437.5 and 500 μg/plate) or genotoxic (0.05; 0.5; 5.0; 50 and 500 μg/mL) effects were observed in any sample tested for all measured concentrations. Cytotoxic responses were observed for eukaryotic cells in all tested samples at 500 and 5000 μg/mL concentrations. Cytotoxicity found in the WST-1 assay was independent of the metabolism of substances present in samples compositions. The cytotoxicity observed in the LDH release assay depended on metabolism., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The mutagenic potential of total aqueous, total oligomers flavonoids (TOF), ethyl acetate (EA), chloroform (Chl), petroleum ether (PE) and methanol (MeOH) extracts from aerial parts of Moricandia arvensis was assessed using Ames Salmonella tester strains TA100 and TA1535 with and without metabolic activation (S9), and using plasmid pBluescript DNA assay. None of the different extracts produced a mutagenic effect, except aqueous extract when incubated with Salmonella typhimurium TA100 after metabolic activation. Likewise, the antimutagenicity of the same extracts was tested using the \"Ames test\". Our results showed that M. arvensis extracts possess antimutagenic effects against sodium azide (SA) in the two tested Salmonella assay systems, except metabolized aqueous and PE extracts when tested with S. typhimurium TA100 assay system. Different extracts were also found to be effective in protecting plasmid DNA against the strand breakage induced by hydroxyl radicals, except PE and aqueous extracts. Antioxidant capacity of the tested extracts was evaluated using the enzymatic (xanthine/xanthine oxidase assay) (X/XOD) and the non enzymatic (NBT/Riboflavine assay) systems. TOF extract was the more effective one in inhibiting both xanthine oxidase activity and NBT reduction., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Reverse mutation (Ames) tests with Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100 and TA1537, and chromosomal aberration tests in vitro with a Chinese hamster fibroblast cell line (CHL), were carried out on fluorinated pyrimidine derivatives, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-fluorouracil (FT), 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR), 1,3-bis(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-fluorouracil (FD-1) and a mixture of uracil and FT in the molar ratio 4 : 1 (UFT) (Fujii et al., 1978). For comparison, similar tests were also carried out on 4 anti-metabolic agents, a metabolite of FD-1 and a component of UFT, such as cytosine-1-beta-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), 6-thioguanine (6-TG), 8-azaguanine (8-AG), 3-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-fluorouracil (3-FT) and uracil. The anti-bacterial action of 4 fluorinated pyrimidine derivatives such as 5-FU, FT, FD-1 and UFT to TA100 was tested under the condition that buffer, S9 mix, S9 and albumin were present. 6-MP was only positive in the Ames test with TA100 in the system without S9 mix, while all others failed to show mutagenic activity. On the other hand, all compounds tested, except uracil, induced chromosomal aberrations on CHL cells in the system without metabolic activation. FT was degraded by S9, but there was no significant difference in the killing activity of FT among with buffer, S9 mix and albumin. The killing activity of 5-FU was the strongest with buffer, and it was slightly binding to albumin. The killing activity of 5-FU was mostly decreased by S9 mix. FD-1 showed the strongest anti-bacterial action when S9 mix was present but it was degraded by S9. UFT showed no anti-bacterial action in any conditions., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: To determine the role of cysteine conjugate beta-lyase (beta-lyase) in the metabolism of mutagenic nitropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, we determined the effect of beta-lyase on the mutagenicities and DNA binding of cysteine conjugates of 4,5-epoxy-4,5-dihydro-1-nitropyrene (1-NP 4,5-oxide) and 9,10-epoxy-9,10-dihydro-1-nitropyrene (1-NP 9,10-oxide), which are detoxified metabolites of the mutagenic compound 1-nitropyrene. We purified beta-lyase from Peptostreptococcus magnus GAI0663, since P. magnus is one of the constituents of the intestinal microflora and exhibits high levels of degrading activity with cysteine conjugates of 1-nitropyrene oxides (1-NP oxide-Cys). The activity of purified beta-lyase was optimal at pH 7.5 to 8.0, was completely inhibited by aminooxyacetic acid and hydroxylamine, and was eliminated by heating the enzyme at 55 degrees C for 5 min. The molecular weight of beta-lyase was 150,000, as determined by fast protein liquid chromatography. S-Arylcysteine conjugates were good substrates for this enzyme. As determined by the Salmonella mutagenicity test, 5 ng of beta-lyase protein increased the mutagenicity of the cysteine conjugate of 1-NP 9,10-oxide (10 nmol per plate) 4.5-fold in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and 4.1-fold in strain TA100. However, beta-lyase had little effect on the cysteine conjugate of 1-NP 4,5-oxide (10 nmol per plate). Both conjugates exhibited only low levels of mutagenicity with nitroreductase-deficient strain TA98NR. In vitro binding of 1-NP oxide-Cys to calf thymus DNA was increased by adding purified beta-lyase or xanthine oxidase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS), Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Hydrolysates of infusions of green tea and black tea were mutagenic by the Ames test. The tea infusions were prepared by a regular method and were hydrolysed with 1 M HCl, hesperidinase, naringinase and human intestinal bacteria. The hydrolysates were successively extracted with chloroform, diethyl ether and ethyl acetate. The mutagenicities of the extracts were assayed by the Ames test, and the mutagens were analysed by GC-MS. The ether extracts of the hydrolysates of infusions of both green tea and black tea were mutagenic of TA98 and TA100 with or without S9 mix. The most common mutagenic flavonols, kaempferol, quercetin and myricetin, were detected in the extract by GC-MS, and their combined mutagenicity represented about 70% of the whole mutagenic activity in the extract., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The effects of curcumin, the yellow pigment of the spice, turmeric (Curcuma longa) on the mutagenicity of several environmental mutagens were investigated in the Salmonella/microsome test with or without Aroclor 1254-induced rat-liver homogenate (S-9 mix). With Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the presence of S-9 mix, curcumin inhibited the mutagenicity of bidi and cigarette smoke condensates, tobacco and masheri extracts, benzo[a]pyrne and dimethyl benzo[a]anthracene in a dose-dependent manner. Curcumin did not influence the mutagenicity without S-9 mix of sodium azide, monoacetylhydrazine and streptozocin in strain TA100 nor of 4-nitrophenylenediamine in strain TA98. Our observations indicate that curcumin may alter the metabolic activation and detoxification of mutagens., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: 2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5',6,6'-Decachlorobiphenyl (PCB 209) is a fully chlorinated, non-coplanar biphenyl. To demonstrate that PCB 209 is not likely to exhibit human health hazards common to coplanar PCBs it was tested for cytochrome P450 (P450) enzyme induction potentials, genetic toxicity, and endocrine-modulating activity. PCB 209 (dose from 0.005 to 5000 ng/mL) did not significantly induce P450 CYP1A, 2A, 2B, 3A, or 4A enzyme activities in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. In contrast, Aroclor 1260, a PCB mixture that contains approximately 60% chlorine by weight, showed significant induction of P450 CYP1A, 2A, 2B, and 3A within the same dose range. PCB 209 (dose from 100 to 5000 microg/plate) was negative in the bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) test in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537 or in Eschericia coli strain WP2uvrA. PCB 209 (dose from 25 to 150 microg/mL) was also negative for forward mutations at the thymidine kinase (TK+/-) locus of L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells. The Ames and the mouse lymphoma assays were both conducted in the absence and presence of rat liver S9 fraction. PCB 209 (dose from 500 to 2000 mg/kg by single dose oral gavage) did not induce an increase in the frequency of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes in mouse bone marrow in vivo. PCB 209 did not induce estrogenic effects when administered by gavage to ovariectomized adult female rats at 500 and 1000 mg/kg for 4 days, nor did it produce alterations consistent with endocrine-modulating activity in adult intact male rats when administered by gavage at 500 and 1000 mg/kg for 15 consecutive days., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: In the neotropical savannah, Astronium species are used in popular medicine to treat allergies, inflammation, diarrhea and ulcers. Given that natural products are promising starting points for the discovery of novel potentially therapeutic agents, the aim of the present study was to investigate the mutagenic and antimutagenic activities of hydroalcoholic extracts of Astronium spp. The mutagenicity was determined by the Ames test on Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA97a, TA100 and TA102. The antimutagenicity was tested against the direct-acting and indirect-acting mutagens. The results showed that none of the extracts induce any increase in the number of revertants, demonstrating the absence of mutagenic activity. On the other hand, the results on the antimutagenic potential showed a moderate inhibitory effect against NPD and a strong protective effect against B[a]P and AFB1. This study highlights the importance of screening species of Astronium for new medicinal compounds. The promising results obtained open up new avenues for further study and provide a better understanding the mechanisms by which these species act in protecting DNA from damage. However, further pharmacological and toxicological investigations of crude extracts of Astronium spp., as well as of its secondary metabolites, are necessary to determine the mechanism(s) of action to guarantee their safer and more effective application to human health. , Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The combination of chemical analyses and bioassays allows the identification of potentially mutagenic compounds in different types of samples. Dyes can be considered as emergent contaminants and were detected in waters, under the influence of textile activities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of 9 azo dyes to the mutagenicity of representative environmental samples. Samples were collected along one year in the largest conglomerate of textile industries of Brazil. We analyzed water samples from an important water body, Piracicaba River, upstream and downstream two main discharges, the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the tributary Quilombo River, which receives untreated effluent from local industries. Samples were analyzed using a LC-MS/MS and tested for mutagenicity in the Salmonella/microsome microsuspension assay with TA98 and YG1041. Six dyes were detected in the collected samples, Disperse Blue 291, Disperse Blue 373, Disperse Orange 30, Disperse Red 1, Disperse Violet 93, and Disperse Yellow 3. The most sensitive condition for the detection of the mutagenicity was the strain YG1041 with S9. The concentration of dyes and mutagenicity levels varied along time and the dry season represented the worst condition. Disperse Blue 373 and Disperse Violet 93 were the major contributors to the mutagenicity. We conclude that dyes are contributing for the mutagenicity of Piracicaba River water; and both discharges, WWTP effluent and Quilombo River, increase the mutagenicity of Piracicaba River waters in about 10-fold. The combination of chemical analysis and bioassays were key in the identification the main drivers of the water mutagenicity and allows the selection of priority compounds to be included in monitoring programs as well for the enforcing actions required to protect the water quality for multiple uses., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: A new tester strain, TA102, is described as an addition to the set of strains for the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test. This strain contains A X T base pairs at the site of the mutation (determined by DNA sequence analysis) in contrast to the other Salmonella tester strains that detect mutagens damaging G X C base pairs. This strain differs from previous tester strains in that the mutation has been introduced into a multicopy plasmid, so that approximately equal to 30 copies of the mutant gene are available for back mutation. The new strain detects a variety of oxidative mutagens, including x-rays, bleomycin, hydrogen peroxide and other hydroperoxides, streptonigrin and other quinones, and phenylhydrazine; a variety of aldehydes, including formaldehyde, glyoxal, kethoxal, glutaraldehyde, and malondialdehyde; a number of psoralens (in the presence of near-UV light), mitomycin C, neocarzinostatin, and UV light. Some of these mutagens have been previously shown to damage thymine in DNA. Several auxiliary tester strains also are described, including TA96, a frameshift tester strain with a hot spot for mutation at a run of five A X T base pairs with a specificity similar to that of TA102. The importance of oxidative mutagens is discussed., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Pyranocoumarins are compounds with an important pharmacological profile, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cytotoxic, antiviral, antibacterial, and hypoglycemic effects. These molecules have a widespread presence as secondary metabolites in medicinal plants used to treat Diabetes Mellitus (DM). The aim of this work was to evaluate antidiabetic activity in Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and the antioxidant effects of 3',4'-Di-O-acetyl-cis-khellactone (DOAcK), as well as its toxic potential. We obtained DOAcK with an enantiomeric excess of 70% by chemical synthesis. Our results showed that this compound exerts an important antidiabetic effect: blood glucose decreased in groups treated with DOAcK by 60.9% at dose of 15mg/kg (p<0.05) compared with the diabetic control group, and demonstrated a statistically significant increase in weight gain (45.7±9.7 in the group treated with DOAcK vs. -23.0±33.1 in the group with diabetes). In a biochemical profile, DOAcK did not modify lipid metabolism and did not cause damage at the renal level. DOAcK administration increased the activities of Catalase (CAT), Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), and Super Oxide Dismutase (SOD) to levels near those of the healthy group. Histopathological analysis exhibited morphology similar to that of the healthy group and the group treated with DOAcK. DOAcK is not mutagenic by Ames test for Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, or TA102, and is not genotoxic by Micronucleus assay; median lethal dose (LD50) >2000mg/kg and, at this dose, no signs of toxicity or death were reported after 14days of observation. These results indicate that DOAcK can improve glucose metabolism, which may be due to the increased antioxidant activity of CAT, GPx and SOD. In addition, DOAcK is not toxic in the studies tested., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: To gain insight on biochemical mechanisms of mutagenesis and carcinogenesis by the experimental carcinogens, 5-nitrofurans, a new series of 3,4-dichloro-5-nitrofurans, comprised of 3,4-dichloro-5-nitro-2-acetylfuran (I), 3,4-dichloro-5-nitro-2-bromoacetylfuran (II), methyl 3,4-dichloro-5-nitro-2-furoate (III), were synthesized and tested for their activation to mutagenic forms in the standard plate assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, and TA100NR, a derivative of TA100 deficient in nitroreductase activity. The mutagenic responses in TA98 were 2- to 6-fold lower compared to TA100. Furthermore, I and II were less active in TA100NR, while compound III was about four times more mutagenic in TA100NR compared to the parent strain TA100. Incubation of III with NADPH and bacterial lysates showed that the extent of reduction was greater in TA100 compared to TA100NR. High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis of the ethyl acetate extract obtained from incubation of III with lysates of TA100 revealed the formation of four metabolites with retention times of about 4.0, 5.7, 10.0, and 14.3 minutes. The spectroscopic and chromatographic properties of the components with retention times of 10.0 and 14.3 minutes were identical to two derivatives obtained by chemical reduction of III, and thus represent nitroreduction products. These derivatives have been identified as cis- and trans-oxime isomers of methyl 3,4-dichloro-2-furoate, based on spectroscopic analyses. These oximes were not mutagenic for TA100. Furthermore, III was more mutagenic under anaerobic conditions, suggesting that secondary superoxide or nitroanion free radicals generated from nitroreduction are not responsible for the mutagenicity of III. In addition, the higher mutagenic response in TA100NR, and the lack of mutagenic activities of the amino and the oxime analogs of III suggest that the mutagenic activation of III might be due to the nitroso intermediate or involve mechanisms other than nitroreduction., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Unpolymerized dental monomers can leach out into the oral biophase and are bioavailable for metabolism. We hypothesize that metabolites would be less toxic than parent monomers. We first identified the formation of metabolites from bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE) and Bisphenol A glycidyl methacrylate (BISGMA) after their exposure to liver S9 fractions. Then, the metabolites and parent compounds were subjected to in vitro cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and estrogenicity studies. Bisphenol A bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether and bisphenol F bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether were the hydroxylated metabolites of BISGMA and BFDGE, respectively. Cytotoxicity against L929 cells showed that the metabolites were significantly (p < 0.05) less cytotoxic than the parent monomers. Only BFDGE was mutagenic in the Ames assay with strain TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium. Parent and metabolite compounds did not stimulate estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cell proliferation above solvent controls. These results indicated that the hydroxylated metabolites were non-mutagenic, non-estrogenic, and less cytotoxic than their parent monomers., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: To clarify the mutagenic potential of surface soil in residential areas in Kyoto city, surface soil samples were collected twice or three times from 12 sites, and their organic extracts were examined by the Ames/Salmonella assay. Almost all (>92%) samples showed mutagenicity in TA98 without and with S9 mix, and 8/25 (32%) samples showed high (1000-10,000 revertants/g of soil) or extreme (>10,000 revertants/g of soil) activity. Moreover, to identify the major mutagens in surface soil in Kyoto, a soil sample was collected at a site where soil contamination with mutagens was severe and continual. The soil extract, which showed potent mutagenicity in TA98 without S9 mix, was fractionated by diverse column chromatography methods. Five major mutagenic constituents were isolated and identified to be 1,6-dinitropyrene (DNP), 1,8-DNP, 1,3,6-trinitropyrene (TNP), 3,9-dinitrofluoranthene (DNF), and 3,6-dinitrobenzo[e]pyrene (DNBeP) by co-chromatography using high performance liquid chromatography and spectral analysis. Contribution ratios of 1,6-DNP, 1,8-DNP, 1,3,6-TNP, 3,9-DNF, and 3,6-DNBeP to total mutagenicity of the soil extract in TA98 without S9 mix were 3, 10, 10, 10, and 6%, respectively. These nitroarenes were detected in surface soil samples collected from four different residential sites in other prefectures, and their contribution ratios to soil mutagenicity were from 0.7 to 22%. These results suggest that surface soil in residential areas in Kyoto was widely contaminated with mutagens and there were some sites where surface soils were heavily polluted. 1,6-DNP, 1,8-DNP, 1,3,6-TNP, 3,9-DNF, and 3,6-DNBeP may be major mutagenic constituents that contaminate surface soil in Kyoto and other residential areas., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Scandix pecten-veneris L. or Shepherd's-needle is a weed species used in some countries for medicinal purposes. In this study S. pecten-veneris leaves were shade dried, powdered and extracted with methanol. The purpose of this study was to assay the in vitro mutagenic, antimutagenic, antioxidant, antilipoxygenase and antimicrobial activities of S. pecten-veneris leaf extract. The methanolic extract indicated no mutagenicity when tested with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. Antimutagenic activity was reported with inhibition of mutagenicity in a concentration dependent fashion. The methanolic extract demonstrated antioxidant activity in the DPPH radical-scavenging test (IC50 = 4.57 mg/mL), comparable to ascorbic acid and BHT. Moreover, the extract presented a remarkable and potent inhibition against soybean lipoxygenase (IC50 = 641.57 µg/mL). The methanolic extract was examined for its antimicrobial powers against four different bacteria with MIC values >100. Our results introduced this plant as a useful factor for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and infectious diseases. , Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The in vitro antimutagenic and DNA protecting potential of organic (methanol, hexane, n-butanol) and aqueous extract/fractions of Parkinsonia aculeata L. (Fabaceae) was investigated by employing Ames assay and DNA nicking assay. DNA damage by hydroxyl radicals was effectively inhibited by all the extract/fractions. A marked antimutagenic effect was observed against 4-Nitro-o-phenylenediamine and sodium azide (direct acting mutagens) and 2-Aminofluorene (indirect acting mutagen) in TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium. In Ames assay, two different modes of experiments i.e. pre-incubation and co-incubation were performed and it was observed that all the extract/fractions showed better results in the pre-incubation as compared to co- incubation mode. Out of all the extract/fractions tested, n-butanol fraction was found to be the most effective in preventing DNA damage and inhibiting mutagenesis. UHPLC analysis of extract/fractions revealed presence of polyphenols such as gallic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, umbelliferone, coumaric acid, rutin, and ellagic acid etc. DNA protecting and antimutagenic activity of this plant could be attributed to presence of these polyphenols. The results of this study indicate the presence of potent antioxidant factors in Parkinsonia aculeata L, which are being explored further for their mechanism of action. , Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: We have previously described a very sensitive and efficient bacterial test designed to detect chemical carcinogens as mutagens. Chloroacetaldehyde is mutagenic in this system and is of interest because it is a possible metabolite in mammals of the large volume industrial chemicals 1,2-dichloroethane (ethylene dichloride) (3.5 billion kg/yr, U.S.) and vinyl chloride (2.5 billion kg/yr, U.S.), and of the antineoplastic agent cyclophosphamide. Chloroacetaldehyde reverts a new Salmonella bacterial tester strain (TA100). Chloroacetaldehyde is shown to be hundreds of times more effective in reversion of TA100 than is chloroethanol (ethylene chlorohydrin), a known metabolic precursor of chloroacetaldehyde and a possible metabolite of dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, or than vinyl chloride, which is itself mutagenic for TA100. Chloroethanol is shown to be activated by rat (or human) liver homogenates to a more highly mutagenic form with reversion properties similar to chloroacetaldehyde. Reversion properties of cyclophosphamide after in vitro metabolic activation suggest that chloroacetaldehyde is not the active mutagenic form of this antineoplastic drug., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Nitroscanate (NSC) was found to be a direct acting mutagen in the Ames Salmonella tester strains TA100 and TA98 and this activity increased further in the presence of rat liver S9 mix. It was inactive in TA98NR and TA100NR, and weakly active in TA98/1,8-DNP6. A substantial fall in drug induced mutagenicity by pentachlorophenol, an inhibitor of acetyltransferase, in TA98, TA100 and YG1024 suggests the initial bioconversion of a nitro group to hydroxylamine and its further activation to the ultimate N-acetoxyarylamine. The refrigerated DMSO solution of the drug in the plate incorporation assay and freshly prepared solutions using the pre-incubation procedure indicated a fall in mutagenicity owing to the conversion of NSC to N,N'-bis-4-(p-nitrophenoxy)phenyl thiourea (NFPT). The drastic reduction in mutagenicity in the presence of 4-amino-4'-nitrodiphenyl ether (ANDE) and 4-aminodiphenyl ether (ADE) was also attributed to the conversion of NSC to the corresponding thiourea, a non-mutagen. The negligible mutagenicity of ANDE and its absence in ADE and 4-isothiocyanate diphenyl ether (ITDE) suggests that the mutagenicity of NSC is due to the nitro group, and the -NCS function is responsible for enhanced mutagenicity over nor-isothiocyanate 4-nitrodiphenyl ether (NDE)., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Many metals have been shown to alter the function of a wide range of enzyme systems, including those involved in DNA repair and replication. To assess the impact in vivo of such metal actions a \"Microtitre\" fluctuation assay was used to examine the ability of Ni(II) to act as a comutagen with simple alkylating agents. In E. coli, Ni(II) chloride potentiated the mutagenicity of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) in polymerase-proficient strains (WP2+ and WP2-), but not in polA- strains (WP6 and WP67) or in lexA- (CM561) or recA- (CM571) strains. The absence of UV excision repair (WP2- and WP67) had little, if any, effect. An extended lag phase was seen at 2-4 h in the polA- strains following treatment with Ni(II) chloride and MMS, but normal growth resumed thereafter. Results suggested that mutations induced by MMS were fixed during log phase growth and that more than 2 h of exposure were necessary for potentiation by Ni(II) to be observed. Thus, the extended lag phase probably cannot explain the lack of potentiation. RecA-dependence of the comutagenic effect was corroborated with S. typhimurium TA1535 and TA100. Only in the pKM101 containing strain, TA100, was potentiation of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and MMS by Ni(II) chloride evident. The mucAB genes carried on pKM101 increase the sensitivity of TA100 to a variety of mutagens, providing there is a functional recA gene product. Taken together, the data suggest that Ni(II) acts indirectly, as a comutagen, in bacterial systems, possibly affecting processes involving recA- and/or polA-dependent function(s)., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Mutagenic and antimutagenic activities against direct acting mutagens, nifuroxazide (NF) and sodium azide (SA), and indirect acting mutagen aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) of extracts prepared from aerial parts of Pituranthos tortuosus were investigated in bacterial assay systems (i.e., the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA100, TA98, TA1538, TA1535, and the SOS chromotest with Escherichia coli PQ 37). It was found that all extracts obtained from P. tortuosus decreased the mutagenicity induced by AFB1 (10 microg/assay), SA (1.5 microg/assay), and NF (20 microg/assay). Ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol, and total oligomer flavenoid extracts exhibited the highest inhibition level of mutagenicity induced by the indirect mutagen AFB1. In addition, antiproliferative and apoptotic properties of these extracts have also been reported using two leukemia cell lines, L1210 and K562. The results revealed that all extracts showed a significant cytotoxic effect on these cell lines, and the effect was greater in the presence of human K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, whereas they do not induce apoptosis., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Mouriri pusa Gardner and Mouriri elliptica Martius are fruit-bearing plants of the Melastomataceae family, popularly known in Brazil as puçá-preto or jaboticaba-do-cerrado, and they are used in folk medicine for the treatment of gastric ulcers. In this study, we employ the Ames test to assess the mutagenicity of compounds obtained from the leaves of these species. The methanol extract of the M. pusa was mutagenic to the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA97a and TA100, with or without metabolic activation. The methanol extract of M. elliptica induced mutagenic activity in TA98 when metabolized with S9 fraction and TA97a with and without S9, but with lower mutagenicity index (MI) and potencies values than those for M. pusa. Enriched fractions of flavonoids and tannins of M. pusa were also evaluated and they demonstrated positive mutagenicity. The highest values of MI and potency were obtained with the flavonoid fraction, which contains large amounts of quercetin, quercetin glycosides and myricetin. These compounds are probably related to the mutagenicity observed in the Ames test. The dichloromethane extract was not mutagenic in any of the test conditions employed., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Benorylate and its two major hydrolysis products, paracetamol and aspirin were examined for mutagenicity in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome screening test. The compounds were tested in 6 strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA100, TA97 and TA98) in the presence and absence of a rat-liver microsome activation system. Benorylate did not show evidence of mutagenic activity in the 6 strains tested with or without metabolic activation at concentrations ranging from 0.006 to 3 mg per plate. Paracetamol and aspirin likewise did not show any evidence of mutagenic activity at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50 mg per plate for the former and 0.01 to 50 mg per plate for the latter., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The frequency of his+ revertants induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in the strain TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium was decreased by gallic and tannic acid. In weak buffer solutions, the inhibition effects of gallic acid towards MNU and MNNG mutagenicity was caused primarily by a decrease of pH in the incubation mixtures. At adjusted pH (pH 5.0 and 6.5), the antimutagenic effects are largely the result of an interaction between MNU or MNNG with phenolic acids outside the cells., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The Salmonella mutagenicity assay has been used to investigate the mutagenicity of cigarette smoke and cigarette smoke condensate. The Kentucky reference (K1R4F) cigarette is designed to be representative of full-flavor, low-tar cigarettes sold in the U.S. and to serve as a reference standard for comparative studies on the chemistry and biological activities of cigarette smoke and condensate. The objective of this study was to determine if the mutagenicity of mainstream smoke condensate from the K1R4F, as measured by the Salmonella mutagenicity assay, is representative of the mutagenic activity of U.S. cigarettes. Mainstream smoke condensates prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide from the K1R4F and 73 brand styles (representing greater than 70% of the total U.S. cigarette market) were assayed using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 (+S9) at concentrations of 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125 and 250 micrograms/plate. Revertants/mg condensate were determined by calculating the slopes of the dose-response curves using linear and nonlinear regression models. Revertants/cigarette were determined by multiplying the revertants/mg condensate by the mg condensate/cigarette. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed between the mean mutagenicity of U.S. market and K1R4F mainstream smoke condensates in terms of revertants/mg condensate or revertants/cigarette. Increased variability in mutagenicity was observed among the U.S. brands versus that of the K1R4F. This is not surprising since variability among the U.S. brands would be expected to have both measurement error and brand style variability while the K1R4F variability contains only the measurement error portion. These results demonstrate that the K1R4F is a representative model for the U.S. cigarette market in comparative Salmonella mutagenicity studies using mainstream smoke condensates., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Chlorogenic acid, a compound which occurs naturally in many food items, was assayed for genotoxic activity in 3 different test systems: reverse mutations in the preincubation test with Salmonella typhimurium, gene conversion with Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain D7, and chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Chlorogenic acid was directly convertogenic and clastogenic, but lacked a mutagenic capacity in the Salmonella bioassay. The transition metal Mn2+ enhanced the clastogenic and convertogenic activity of chlorogenic acid. In the presence of Mn2+ (10(-4)M), chlorogenic acid increased the frequency of his+ revertants in TA98 and TA100 strains of S. typhimurium. Caffeic acid and, to a lesser degree, quinic acid, which are components of chlorogenic acid, also showed genotoxic activity. The results show the importance of using several assays in combination with transition metals when testing for genotoxicity., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: In a previous study we screened a range of mushroom species growing in Slovenia for their anti-genotoxic potential and found Lactarius vellereus to be the most effective. In this study genotoxic and anti-genotoxic activities of methanol extracts of Lactarius vellereus (Fr.: Fr.) Fr. were evaluated in the bacterial reverse mutation test with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and, in the mammalian cell test with human hepatoma (HepG2) cells, using the comet assay to measure DNA damage. The extract induced no mutations in S. typhimurium TA98 and no DNA damage in HepG2 cells. Against the indirect acting mutagen 2-amino-3-methylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoline (IQ) the extract showed significant, dose dependent antimutagenic activity, while it did not counteract the direct acting mutagen 4-nitroquinoline oxide (4-NQO). The extract also exerted a protective effect against IQ induced genotoxicity in mammalian cells of human origin. Treatment of HepG2 cells with the L. vellereus extract (125-500 microg/ml) together with IQ, reduced the genotoxic effect of the latter in a dose dependent manner. Our findings show that a methanol extract of L. vellereus is highly protective against IQ induced DNA damage in human derived cells and L. vellereus can be considered as a natural source of antimutagens with potential pharmacological applications in cancer prevention., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: A monitoring of the urinary mutagenicity in workers occupationally exposed to low doses of 2,4,7-trinitro-9-fluorenone (TNF) was undertaken. Urine concentrate of 22 exposed workers (11 smokers and 11 nonsmokers) and 18 presumedly unexposed workers (7 smokers and 11 nonsmokers) were assayed for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 with the plate incorporation technique. In this test system none of the urine concentrate was effective as a mutagen, either in the absence or presence of S9. Fifteen urine samples (8 from exposed workers, 7 from referents) were also tested in the microtiter fluctuation assay. With this technique smoking habits were significantly related to urinary mutagenicity in tests performed with metabolic activation. In neither case however was the association between presumed exposure and urinary mutagenicity significant. These results were evaluated on the basis of urinary mutagenicity data obtained from rats exposed to TNF by different routes. It was shown that the observed urinary mutagenicity accounts for a minor fraction of the administered TNF dose (about 0.1 to 0.2%, depending on the route of exposure); thus it is possible that low-level exposure to TNF could escape detection by urinary mutagenicity monitoring., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: 2-Hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (HNQ; Lawsone; CAS 83-72-7) is the principal natural dye ingredient contained in the leaves of Henna (Lawsonia inermis). Published genotoxicity studies on HNQ suggested it was a weak bacterial mutagen for Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 or was more clearly mutagenic for strain TA 2637, both in the presence of metabolic activation. HNQ was unable to induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster. However, a small increase in micronucleus frequency was reported in the bone marrow of mice at a single mid-range dose level, 24h after intraperitoneal injection. In view of the wide use of Henna hair dyes it was deemed necessary to conduct a thorough investigation, under Good Laboratory Practice conditions, of the genotoxicity of HNQ. HNQ was non-mutagenic in bacterial (Ames test) or mammalian (V79 hprt) assays. It was borderline positive in a mouse lymphoma tk mutation assay and a chromosome aberration test (CHO cells), results that may reflect a similar clastogenic mechanism. Negative in vivo genotoxicity results were noted in the rat hepatocyte in vivo/in vitro UDS test, in peripheral lymphocytes (chromosome aberrations) of rats receiving repeated oral doses of HNQ at the MTD for 28 days, and in mouse and hamster bone marrow chromosome aberration tests. However small, but statistically significant increases in the incidence of bone marrow micronuclei were observed in two out of five tests at 72 h after dosing, but not at 24 or 48 h. There was evidence of haematotoxicity at 72 h, which may have been enhanced by the vehicle (DMSO) used in the positive tests. As erythropoiesis and administration of haematotoxic agents are known to induce small increases in the frequency of bone marrow micronuclei, typically at delayed sampling times, the data suggest that the positive 72 h response produced by HNQ is consistent with stimulation of haematopoiesis subsequent to haematological toxicity of HNQ, and not due to a DNA-reactive mechanism. Overall, the weight of evidence suggests that Henna and HNQ pose no genotoxic risk to the consumer., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Possible mutagenic and co-mutagenic effects of strong static magnetic fields were estimated using bacterial mutagenicity test. Mutagenic potential of static magnetic fields up to 5T (T:1T=10,000 G) was not detected by the bacterial mutagenicity test using four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537) and Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA either in the pre-incubation method or in the plate incorporation method. In the co-mutagenicity test, E. coli WP2 uvrA cells were treated with various chemical mutagens and were simultaneously exposed to a 2T or a 5T static magnetic field. Mutation rate in the exposed group was significantly higher than that in the non-exposed group when cells were treated with N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS), 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO), 2-amino-3-methyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) or 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (AF-2). The mutagenicity of 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA), 9-aminoacridine (9-AA), N4-aminocytidine and 2-acetoamidofluorene (2-AAF) was not affected by the magnetic field exposure. Possible mechanisms of the co-mutagenicity of magnetic fields are discussed., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: S-1 is a new antineoplastic agent of a fluorinated pyrimidine derivative containing tegafur (FT), 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP) and potassium oxonate (Oxo) in a molar ratio of 1:0.4:1 with the aim of prolonging the effective plasma concentration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and reducing its dose-limiting gastrointestinal toxicity. As a part of the safety evaluation of S-1, reverse mutation tests using bacteria and chromosomal aberration tests using cultured cells, CHL/IU, were conducted to test the in vitro mutagenicity of S-1, CDHP and Oxo. All S-1 doses are expressed as the content of FT. 1. The reverse mutation tests were carried out on S-1 at 1.02-520 micrograms/plate, on CDHP at 39.1-5000 micrograms/plate, and on Oxo at 78.1-5000 micrograms/plate using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA98, and TA1537 and Escherichia coli WP2uvrA. None of the test compounds induced a significant increase over solvent controls in the number of mutant colonies in any tester strains in either system, with or without mammalian metabolic activation (S9 Mix). 2. For the in vitro chromosomal aberration tests, Chinese hamster lung cells (CHL/IU), were treated with S-1 at 27.5-220 micrograms/ml for 24 hr or at 6.88-27.5 micrograms/ml for 48 hr without S9 Mix, and at 110-880 micrograms/ml with S9 Mix, with CDHP at 365-1460 micrograms/ml (10 mM), and with Oxo at 122-1950 micrograms/ml (10 mM), with and without S9 Mix. S-1 with and without S9 Mix, and Oxo only for 48 h treatment without S9 Mix, induced chromosomal aberrations, while CDHP did not. 3. The present study indicates that S-1 was nonmutagenic in bacteria, but clastogenic in vitro. CDHP had no in vitro mutagenic or clastogenic activity. Oxo was positive in the in vitro chromosomal aberration test, but negative in the reverse mutation test., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The mutagenicities of 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX, compound 1), 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (RMX, compound 6), and 2-(dichloromethyl)-3,3-dichloropropenal (TCB, compound 7) were determined in the same assay and in repetitive determinations using Salmonella typhimurium (TA 100) without microsomal fraction activation. In addition, the mutagenicity of 2-methyl-3,3-dichloropropenal (compound 8) was assayed in the same manner although not simultaneously with MX, RMX, and TCB. This study was undertaken to ascertain the role of open- and closed-ring forms of MX in the mutagenicity of MX. MX proved to be roughly 100 times more mutagenic than the open-ring analogue TCB and 10 times more mutagenic than the closed-ring analogue RMX. Compound 8 was inactive. Assay stability of the three active compounds in Vogel-Bonner medium at 38 degrees C was estimated as the chemical half-life values by following the change in UV absorbance at selected wave lengths. Half-life values were 10.7, 2.6, and 2.8 hr, respectively, for MX, RMX, and TCB. The enhanced mutagenicity of MX relative to RMX and TCB is attributed to the intrinsic mutagenicity of MX and its greater stability is judged to play only a minor role. Moreover, the greater mutagenicity of the closed-ring analogue RMX relative to the open-ring analogue TCB points to the ring form of MX as the active species even though the open form of MX is predominant under assay conditions., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Sulforaphane, a constituent of broccoli was investigated for its antimutagenic potential against different classes of cooked food mutagens (heterocyclic amines). These include imidazoazaarenes such as 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP); pyridoindole derivatives such as 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2); and, dipyridoimidazole derivative such as 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1). Tests were carried out by Ames Salmonella/reversion assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 (frame shift mutation sensitive) and TA100 (base pair mutation sensitive) bacterial strains in the presence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver S9. Results of these in vitro antimutagenicity studies strongly suggest that sulforaphane is a potent inhibitor of the mutagenicity induced by imidazoazaarenes such as IQ, MeIQ and MeIQx (approximately 60% inhibition) and moderately active against pyridoindole derivatives such as Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 (32-48% inhibition), but ineffective against dipyridoimidazole derivative (Glu-P-1) in TA 100., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Nitromezuril (NZL) is a novel triazine compound that exhibits remarkable anticoccidial activity. However, mutagenicity and genotoxicity of NZL have not been evaluated to date. This study evaluated the potential risks of NZL by testing for bacterial reverse mutation (Ames), mouse sperm abnormality (SA), bone marrow micronucleus (MN) and chromosomal aberration (CA). Mice were orally administered with NZL at 385, 192 and 96 mg/kg, corresponding to 0.5 ×, 0.25 × and 0.125 × the LD50 of NZL, respectively. No significant increases in SA and CA were found in mice treated with NZL for 5d and 3d, respectively (P>0.05). NZL at 96-385 mg/kg did not have significant influence on micronucleated polychromatic erythrocyte counts (P>0.05). These results suggest that NZL is not genotoxic. However, Ames test results were positive both with and without the S9 system for Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100, suggesting that NZL may be mutagenic. The mutagenic effects of NZL were different in in vitro and in vivo assays. Further studies should be conducted to confirm the safety of using and developing NZL as a novel anticoccidial drug., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Eight components of humic substances were ozonated. Mutagenic activity was found with TA100 with and without S9 mix for all ozonated components. Ozonated products of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde were separated into five fractions by silica gel chromatography and each fraction subjected to mutagenicity assay. Mutagenic activity was found in the chloroform and chloroform-acetone (1:1) fractions. The compounds in these fractions were identified, and aldehydes such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, glyoxal, glyoxylic acid and methyl glyoxal were found to be mutagenic. Mutagenic compounds are present in the polar fraction., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Among the various kinds of spices tested, the aqueous extracts of dill weed from Anethum graveolens L. and dill seeds from A. sowa D.C. (Umbelliferae), exhibited a mutagenicity to Salmonella typhimurium, strains TA98 and TA100. The aqueous methanol extracts were fractionated by the mutation assay using the strain TA98 with S-9 Mix. Isorhamnetin 3-sulfate (persicarin) and quercetin 3-sulfate were characterized as the mutagenic principles. Carcinogenicity was not observed for dill weed and seeds when the diets containing these in 33% were administered for 450 and 410 days, respectively, to the inbred strain ACI rats., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: 2-(3-Chlorobenzyloxy)-6-(piperazin-1-yl)pyrazine (3) is a potent and selective 5-HT(2C) agonist that exhibits dose-dependent inhibition of food intake and reduction in body weight in rats, making it an attractive candidate for treatment of obesity. However, examination of the genotoxicity potential of 3 in the Salmonella Ames assay using tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 revealed a metabolism (rat S9/NADPH)- and dose-dependent increase of reverse mutations in strains TA100 and TA1537. The increase in reverse mutations was attenuated upon coincubation with methoxylamine and glutathione. The irreversible and concentration-dependent incorporation of radioactivity in calf thymus DNA after incubations with [14C]3 in the presence of rat S9/NADPH suggested that 3 was bioactivated to a reactive intermediate that covalently bound DNA. In vitro metabolism studies on 3 with rat S9/NADPH in the presence of methoxylamine and cyanide led to the detection of amine and cyano conjugates of 3. The mass spectrum of the amine conjugate was consistent with condensation of amine with an aldehyde metabolite derived from hydroxylation of the secondary piperazine nitrogen-alpha-carbon bond. The mass spectrum of the cyano conjugate suggested a bioactivation pathway involving N-hydroxylation of the secondary piperazine nitrogen followed by two-electron oxidation to generate an electrophilic nitrone, which reacted with cyanide. The 3-chlorobenzyl motif in 3 was also bioactivated via initial aromatic ring hydroxylation followed by elimination to a quinone-methide species that reacted with glutathione or with the secondary piperazine ring nitrogen in 3 and its monohydroxylated metabolite(s). The metabolism studies described herein provide a mechanistic basis for the mutagenicity of 3., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Acetaminophen (APAP), aspirin (ASA), phenacetin (PA) and ibuprofen (IB) were tested for mutagenic activity in the Ames Salmonella plate incorporation assay using strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538. These analgesics were tested in four separate tests: without metabolic activation, and in the presence of a rat, hamster or mouse liver post-mitochondrial supernatant (S-9, Aroclor 1254-induced). Treatment of all five strains of Salmonella with APAP, ASA or IB under all four metabolic conditions did not induce any appreciable increases in revertant colony counts, as compared to the negative controls. A dose-related increase in revertant colony counts, reaching levels twice the negative control values, were seen with PA at doses greater than or equal to 500 micrograms per plate. This response was only seen in strain TA100 in the presence of hamster S-9. Therefore, these findings constitute a positive result for PA in the Ames test. APAP, ASA and IB did not show any mutagenic potential under these conditions of testing. These findings are discussed along with previously published results concerning the genotoxicity of these analgesics., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The mutagenicities of 22 mono-nitrobenzene derivatives, i.e., nitrobenzene [98-95-3] and the ortho, meta and para isomers of nitrotoluene [88-72-2, 99-08-1, 99-99-0], nitrophenol [88-75-5, 554-84-7, 100-02-7], nitroanisole [91-23-6, 555-03-3, 100-17-4], nitrochlorobenzene [88-73-3, 121-73-3, 100-00-5], nitrobenzoic acid [552-16-9, 121-92-6, 62-23-7], nitrobenzaldehyde [552-89-6, 99-61-6, 555-16-8] and nitrobenzonitrile [612-24-8, 619-24-9, 619-72-7], were tested with or without S9 mix and norharman [244-63-3] in the Salmonella assay system. None of the compounds was mutagenic without norharman. In the presence of norharman, however, nitrobenzene, nitrotoluene, nitroanisole, nitrochlorobenzene and nitrobenzaldehyde exhibited mutagenicity only to S. typhimurium TA98 with S9 mix. This induction of mutagenesis with norharman was strong for the ortho isomers of every nitro-compound, weak for the para isomers, and was not observed for the meta isomers., Yes: 0.99, No: 0.01\n",
            "Question: Purple rice (Oryza sativa L. var. indica) cv. Kum Doisaket is cultivated in northern Thailand. This study evaluated the mutagenic and antimutagenic properties of hydrophilic and lipophilic components of purple rice using the Ames test. The seed and hull of purple rice were extracted with hexane, methanol, ethanol, and water. The methanol extracts had the highest amounts of phenolic acids and flavonoids, while the hexane extracts contained large amount of tocols and γ-oryzanol. None of the extracts were mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. The hexane extract of rice hull and the methanol extract of rice seed were strongly effective against aflatoxin B1- and 2-amino-3, 4 dimethylimidazo (4, 5-f) quinoline-induced mutagenesis, while aqueous extracts showed weakly antimutagenic properties. All extracts with the exception of aqueous extracts enhanced the number of revertant colonies from benzo (a) pyrene induced-mutagenesis. None of the extracts inhibited mutagenesis induced by the direct mutagens 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-acrylamide and sodium azide. The hull extracts showed more potent antimutagenicity than the seed extracts. Based on a chemical analysis, γ-oryzanol and γ-tocotrienol in the hull and cyanidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside in the seed are candidate antimutagens in purple rice. The antimutagenic mechanisms of purple rice might be related to either modulation of mutagen metabolizing enzymes or direct attack on electrophiles. These findings supported the use of Thai purple rice as a cancer chemopreventive agent. , Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Glutathione is activated to a mutagen by gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Other thiols, such as cysteine, penicillamine, cysteine ethylester, and cysteinylglycine, are direct mutagens in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity test. Thiol mutagenesis is oxidative in nature and involves H2O2 and possibly hydroxyl radicals. Transition metals are crucial for thiol autoxidation. The role of copper and ceruloplasmin (CP) in thiol-dependent mutagenesis was studied in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA102. Cu and CP at low concentrations enhanced thiol-dependent mutagenesis in the presence, but not in the absence, of added Fe. The degree of enhancement depended on the type of thiol. At high Cu or CP concentrations, thiol mutagenesis was inhibited. Cu also decreased the mutagenicity of H2O2. Cu- and CP-enhanced mutagenesis were inhibited by radical scavengers, catalase, and peroxidase but not by superoxide dismutase. The effects of Cu and CP on thiol-dependent mutagenesis were similar to their effects on thiol-driven lipid peroxidation. The results indicate that the role of Cu and CP in the enhancement of thiol mutagenesis is the facilitation of the transfer of electrons from a thiol to iron, rather than in catalysis of the Fenton reaction., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The mutagenic potential of two soils amended with a municipal sewage sludge at two application rates was monitored over a 2-year period using Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay. Samples were collected from undisturbed monolith lysimeters of Weswood sandy clay (Fluventic Ustochrept) and Padina sandy loam (Grossarenic Paleustalf) amended with dried sewage sludge at 50 and 100 Mg/ha. Soil samples were collected and sequentially extracted with methylene chloride and methanol. The residues from these extracts were tested for mutagenicity at five doses with and without metabolic activation in Salmonella strain TA98. In general, the mutagenic potential of the amended soils of both application rates for the first 8 weeks following sludge application increased and then slowly decreased. The maximum mutagenic response observed in the soil extracts was 222 revertants at a dose of 10 mg of residue. This response was induced by the methanol extract from the Weswood soil collected 56 days after the application of 50 Mg/ha sewage sludge as compared to the 100 Mg/ha application which induced 202 revertants/mg. The mutagenicity of all fractions extracted from the sludge-amended soil at both application rates collected 717 days after application were not appreciably different from extracts from the unamended soils. The data indicate that chemicals that were mutagenic in bacteria persist in the soil and that at the higher application rates, as much as 2 years may be required for the mutagenic potential of the soil to return to background levels., Yes: 0.01, No: 0.99\n",
            "Question: The antimutagenicity of α-hexylcinnamaldehyde (1), a semisynthetic and more stable derivative of cinnamaldehyde, was evaluated against common environmental pollutants in the bacterial reverse mutation assay. The pre-, co-, and post-treatment protocols were applied to assess the involvement of desmutagenic and/or bioantimutagenic mechanisms. Compound 1 (9-900 μM) produced a strong antimutagenicity (>40% inhibition) in the Salmonella typhimurium TA98 strain against the nitroarenes 2-nitrofluorene and 1-nitropyrene in almost all experimental conditions. A strong inhibition was also reached against the nitroarene 1,8-dinitropyrene and the arylamine 2-aminoanthracene in the cotreatment at the highest concentrations tested. In order to evaluate if an inhibition of bacterial nitroreductase (NR) and O-acetyltransferase (OAT) could be involved in the antimutagenicity of 1 against nitroarenes, the substance was further tested against 1-nitropyrene (activated by both NR and OAT) in TA98NR and TA98 1,8-DNP strains (lacking the NR and OAT enzymes, respectively). Although both desmutagenic and bioantimutagenic mechanisms appear mostly involved in the antimutagenicity of 1, based on data obtained in the TA98NR strain, applying the pretreatment protocol, compound 1 seems to act as an inhibitor of the OAT-mediated mutagen bioactivation. These results provide justification for further studies on 1 as a possible chemopreventive agent. , Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Glycomacropeptide (GMP), a whey protein of milk, has functions including differentiation and development of nervous system, and anticancer and antiviral effects. To develop new functions, N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) containing 7% sialic acid was separated from GMP to produce G-7%NANA. N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is another type of sialic acid separated from GMP, which has been linked to immune disorders and chronic inflammation-mediated diseases. Therefore, safety was a concern in the use of G-7%NANA in functional foods. To ensure safety, in this study, three genetic toxicity tests on G-7%NANA were conducted. In the reverse mutation test using  Salmonella typhimurium  TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and  Escherichia coli  WP2uvrA, and in the chromosome aberration test using CHO-K1 cells, no significant differences from negative control were found at all dose levels. Similarly, no dose-related differences were evident compared to negative control in the micronucleus test using ICR mice. There was no evidence of G-7%NANA-related genetic toxicity., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Mutation frequency tests for isepamicin (HAPA-B), a new aminoglycoside antibiotic, were carried out using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and Escherichia coli WP2uvrA. After a 30-minute exposure of bacterial cells at 37 degrees C to HAPA-B in a buffer solution, the cells were washed twice with a buffer solution to minimize the cytotoxicity of the drug. Then washed cells were inoculated on minimum glucose agar plates to determine mutation frequency. The results should no significant increase in mutation frequency with increasing HAPA-B concentration; suggesting that the drug has no mutagenicity detectable by this test system., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The activation of dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) to a bacterial mutagen in liver subcellular fraction and in intrasanguinous host-mediated assays was studied, in particular the effect of pretreatment of the animals with ethanol or acetone. Salmonella typhimurium TA 92 was much more sensitive to DMN mutagenicity than TA 100 and TA 1535 or Escherichia coli WP2uvrA and was used for the main part of the study. Noteworthy, in part already known, features of the in vitro activation are the relatively low pH optimum (pH 6-6.4), the non-linear dose-mutagenic response-relationship and the relatively high doses of DMN required for activation with control preparations. Pretreatment of mice with ethanol or acetone greatly reduced the minimal mutagenically effective concentration of DMN in the in vitro assay. Pretreatment with Aroclor 1254, an inducer frequently used in mutagenicity research, showed little effect when used alone, but reduced the potentiation by acetone. The results of the host-mediated assays substantially differed from those of the in vitro activation assays (a) in the relatively low dose of DMN required for mutagenicity to occur and (b) in the lack of potentiation by acetone-or ethanol-pretreatment. Acetone even led to a marginal decrease in mutagenicity. As a possible explantation for this apparent discrepancy were assume that with the in vitro system the activity of the dilute metabolizing system is limiting for the activation of DMN and induction therefore will increase the mutagenicity, whereas in vivo DMN is quantitatively metabolized in both induced and non-induced animals. The results show that caution has to be taken in the interpretation from in vitro results to the in vivo situation. In particular our in vivo experiments do not support the hypothesis that the induction by ethanol of an activating system with a low Km (which would strongly activate traces of DMN ingested with many foods) is one of the reasons for the increased risk of liver tumors in alcoholics., Yes: 0.03, No: 0.97\n",
            "Question: Methyl isocyanate (MIC) in aqueous solution forms methylamine (MA) and N,N'-dimethylurea (DMU). MA in buffered system further converts into its salt form, methylamine hydrochloride (MAH). Therefore, MAH and DMU were evaluated for their mutagenic activity in the in vitro Ames Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test. The liquid preincubation protocol was followed, using tester strains TA98, TA100 and TA104 of Salmonella typhimurium, in the presence of 0, 5, 15 and 30% Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver S9 mixture. DMU and MAH did not induce a mutagenic response in any of the tester strains, both in the presence and in the absence of S9 mixture. The results therefore confirm that MIC in its native form or as its unknown metabolites is responsible for the mutagenic activity reported earlier by us in the his tester strains TA100 and TA104 of Salmonella typhimurium (Mutation Res., 204 (1988) 123-129) and not due to its hydrolysis products, MA or DMU., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The effect of arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid on the conversion of the heterocyclic amine 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) to its genotoxic metabolites was investigated using a modified bacterial mutation assay. The assay used Salmonella typhimurium TA98 as an indicator of the mutagenicity and hepatic post-mitochondrial fractions (S-9) from male Sprague-Dawley rats as the activating system. All three fatty acids inhibited the mutagenicity of IQ without effect on the uptake of the active metabolites and/or on the DNA repair processes within the bacterial cell. The activation of three other food mutagens, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was also inhibited by these fatty acids., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Heated sugar/amino acid reaction mixtures, known to contain products that are clastogenic and/or mutagenic to cells in vitro, were evaluated for clastogenic activity in mouse bone marrow using the erythrocyte micronucleus assay. Heated (i.e. browned) fructose/lysine reaction mixtures were also evaluated in the Salmonella his-reversion assay and the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell chromosomal aberration assay to confirm and extend previous in vitro observations. Significant mutagenicity of fructose/lysine mixtures was observed in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA2637, TA98 and TA102, with greater activity in mixtures heated at pH 10 than at pH 7. S-9 decreased the activity in strains TA100, TA2637 and TA98, but increased the activity in strain TA102. Both pH 7 and pH 10 reaction mixtures of the fructose/lysine browning reaction were highly clastogenic in CHO cells. Heated mixtures of fructose and lysine, and of glucose or ribose with lysine, histidine, tryptophan or cysteine, did not increase the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes in mice when administered by the oral route. This indicates the absence of chromosomal aberrations in erythrocyte precursor cells, and indicates that the genotoxic components of the browned mixtures are not absorbed and distributed to bone marrow cells in amounts sufficient to induce micronuclei when given orally. Because sugar/amino acid browning reactions occur commonly in heated foods, it is important to evaluate further the in vivo genotoxicity of browning products in cell populations other than bone marrow., Yes: 0.98, No: 0.02\n",
            "Question: Context Seaweeds from the Mexican Pacific Ocean have not been evaluated as a source of chemoprotectants. Objective The objective of this study is to evaluate chemopreventive activities of the seaweeds Phaephyceae - Padina durvillaei (Dictyotaceae) - Rodhophyceae - Spyridia filamentosa (Spyridiaceae), Gracilaria vermiculophylla (Gracilariaceae) - and Chlorophyceae - Ulva expansa (Ulvaceae), Codium isabelae (Codiaceae), Rhizoclonium riparium (Cladophoraceae) and Caulerpa sertularioides (Caulerpaceae). Materials and methods Methanol, acetone and hexane seaweed extracts were assessed at 30 and 3 mg/mL on antioxidant capacity (DPPH and ABTS assays), 0.003-3.0 mg/plate on antimutagenic activity against AFB1 using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 tester strains in Ames test, and 12.5 to 100 μg/mL on antiproliferative activity on Murine B-cell lymphoma. Phenols, flavonoids and pigments content were also assessed as antioxidant compounds. Results Extraction yield was higher in methanol than in acetone and hexane extracts (6.4, 2.7 and 1.4% dw). Antioxidant capacity was higher in brown and green than in red seaweed species, particularly in P. durvillaei extracted in acetone (EC50  value= 16.9 and 1.56 mg/mL for DPPH and ABTS). Flavonoids and chlorophylls were identified as mainly antioxidant components; particularly in hexane extracts, which were correlated with the antioxidant capacity. Highest mutagenesis inhibition (> 40%) occurred in R. riparium at the lowest concentration assayed (0.003 mg/plate), while highest antiproliferative inhibition (37 and 72% for 12.5 and 25 μg/mL) occurred in C. sertularioides. Discussion and conclusion Flavonoids and chlorophylls explained the chemopreventive activities assessed in S. filamentosa, R. riparium and C. sertularioides. These seaweeds have a high potential as a source of novel chemoprotectants. , Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The hot water extract of the herbal tea, Gynostemma pentaphyllum Makino, was not found to be mutagenic in Salmonella mutation assay with or without metabolic activation. However, the extract had both DT-diaphorase inducing activity in the murine hepatoma (Hepa1c1c7) cell line and antimutagenic properties towards chemical-induced mutation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. Mutagenicity of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido [1, 2-a: 3', 2', 3-d] imidazole (Glu-P-1), 2-aminodipyrido [1, 2-a: 3', 2', 3-d] imidazole (GIu-P-2), 2-amino-1, 4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido [4, 3-b] indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido [4, 3-b] indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo [4, 5-f] quinoline (IQ) and Benzo [a] pyrene (B[a]P) was inhibited by the extract of Gynostemma pentaphyllum Makino in a dose-dependent manner, but no effect was found on the mutagenic activity of 2-(2-Furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (AF-2). However, the extract enhanced the mutagenicity induced by 2-aminoanthracene (2AA), and N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: To clarify the mutagenic potential of surface soil in residential areas in Kyoto city, surface soil samples were collected twice or three times from 12 sites, and their organic extracts were examined by the Ames/Salmonella assay. Almost all (>92%) samples showed mutagenicity in TA98 without and with S9 mix, and 8/25 (32%) samples showed high (1000-10,000 revertants/g of soil) or extreme (>10,000 revertants/g of soil) activity. Moreover, to identify the major mutagens in surface soil in Kyoto, a soil sample was collected at a site where soil contamination with mutagens was severe and continual. The soil extract, which showed potent mutagenicity in TA98 without S9 mix, was fractionated by diverse column chromatography methods. Five major mutagenic constituents were isolated and identified to be 1,6-dinitropyrene (DNP), 1,8-DNP, 1,3,6-trinitropyrene (TNP), 3,9-dinitrofluoranthene (DNF), and 3,6-dinitrobenzo[e]pyrene (DNBeP) by co-chromatography using high performance liquid chromatography and spectral analysis. Contribution ratios of 1,6-DNP, 1,8-DNP, 1,3,6-TNP, 3,9-DNF, and 3,6-DNBeP to total mutagenicity of the soil extract in TA98 without S9 mix were 3, 10, 10, 10, and 6%, respectively. These nitroarenes were detected in surface soil samples collected from four different residential sites in other prefectures, and their contribution ratios to soil mutagenicity were from 0.7 to 22%. These results suggest that surface soil in residential areas in Kyoto was widely contaminated with mutagens and there were some sites where surface soils were heavily polluted. 1,6-DNP, 1,8-DNP, 1,3,6-TNP, 3,9-DNF, and 3,6-DNBeP may be major mutagenic constituents that contaminate surface soil in Kyoto and other residential areas., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Azido-PhIP (2-azido-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine) and nitro-PhIP (2-nitro-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine) have been synthesized and characterized chemically. The mutagenic potencies of azido-PhIP (with photoactivation by near UV irradiation), of nitro-PhIP (without exogenous activation) and of the heterocyclic amine PhIP (with activation by rat liver S9) were evaluated by means of the reversion assay in Salmonella typhimurium. Like PhIP, azido- and nitro-PhIP were potent mutagens in the strain TA98. In addition to TA98, the strains YG1024 with increased and TA98/1,8-DNP6 deficient in acetyltransferase activity and TA98NR deficient in nitroreductase were used. Photolysis of azido-PhIP generates a very short-lived mutagen whose mutagenic potency is similar in all strains used and therefore not dependent on the acetyltransferase and nitroreductase. These findings are analogous to previous ones with azidofluorene and suggest that a short-lived DNA-binding arylnitrenium ion is formed directly by the photolysis of azido-PhIP. The nitroreductase contributes to the mutagenic potency of nitro-PhIP; in TA98NR it is 37% of that in TA98. The acetylator status of the strains influences the mutagenic potencies of PhIP and nitro-PhIP only weakly. This contrasts with findings obtained with 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and nitro-IQ and with other amino- and nitro-imidazoarenes which lose most of their mutagenic activity in the acetyltransferase-deficient strain. This atypical behavior of PhIP suggests that the presumed metabolite, N-hydroxy-PhIP, differs from the N-hydroxy metabolites of other heterocyclic amino- and nitro-imidazoarenes in that in Salmonella it is not significantly activated by O-acetylation. It must therefore either react directly with DNA or be activated in a different way. This divergent behavior of PhIP and N-hydroxy-PhIP in Salmonella may also be a key to the understanding of several 'unusual' properties of PhIP in mammalian cells and organisms., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Diethylstilbestrol was tested for mutagenicity with his- S. typhimurium strains under 10 different matabolic situations (no exogenous metabolizing system; S9 mix from liver homogenate of rats induced with Aroclor 1254, with or without inhibition of epoxide hydratase; liver and/or kidney S9 mix from control or hamsters treated with Aroclor 1254; horse-radish peroxidase + H2O2). Under none of these conditions did diethylstilbestrol give any indication of a mutagenic effect. Furthermore, 11 metabolites and other derivatives of diethylstilbestrol, 2 of them potent inducers of sister-chromatid exchange in cultured fibroblasts, were not mutagenic with any of the 4 tester strains (S. typhimurium TA100, TA98, TA1537, TA1535) in the presence or absence of S9 mix from liver homogenate of rats induced with Aroclor 1254. Thus, one of the few known human carcinogens is very resistant to detection by the mammalian enzyme-mediated Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity test (Ames test). This is especially remarkable since the metabolizing systems used included: (1) some of very high metabolic activity (S9 mix from liver homogenate of rats and hamsters induced with Aroclor 1254); (2) metabolizing systems from organs susceptible to the carcinogenic activity of diethylstilbestrol (hamster kidney); as well as (3) a mixture of (1) and (2) in case both activities are required for the carcinogenic effect in the whole animal., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: In Taiwan, betel quid is a natural masticatory, which is composed of fresh green areca fruit, Piper betle and slaked lime paste. Areca fruit contains some alkaloids, of which arecoline is the major one. N-Nitrosoguvacoline (NG), one of the N-nitrosation products of arecoline, is the only one N-nitrosamine found in Taiwanese betel quid chewing saliva. The mutagenic studies in Ames Salmonella microsome test showed that crude alkaloid extracts of areca fruit and arecoline were active in Salmonella typhimurium TA100, and NG was weakly active in TA98 and TA100. The activities in both arecoline and NG decreased further in the presence of rat liver S9 mix. Nitrite was significantly consumed during the N-nitrosation of arecoline and sodium nitrite at acidic condition (pH 3), whereas the formation of NG was favored at neutral condition (pH 7). Crude phenolic extracts of leaf and inflorescence of Piper betle inhibited the formation of NG by blocking the nitrite. However, a high amount of crude phenolic extracts of areca fruit enhanced the formation of NG., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The Salmonella mutagenicity assay was utilized to compare hepatic S9 fractions derived from wild and laboratory reared woodchucks (Marmota monax). Two promutagens, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracence (DMBA) and 2-amino-fluorene (AF) were tested at 5 concentrations with the tester strains TA98 and TA100, against 2 levels of S9 fraction. AF produced similar number of revertants with the S9 fraction from wild and laboratory-reared animals. DMBA produced 2-4 times more revertant colonies at 50 microliter S9/plate with wild woodchuck S9 than with S9 from the laboratory-reared animals with both tester strains. It was concluded that natural inducers in the wild woodchuck diet may have contributed to the increased reversion frequency over laboratory reared woodchucks. Dose-response parameters for the activation of DMBA by S9 fraction from woodchucks and rats were compared with TA100. Woodchuck S9 had 3-40 more revertants/nmol and a 100-fold lower threshold of response than S9 from Aroclor 1254-induced rats., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Benzo(ghi)perylene (B(ghi))Per, (191-24-2)) and coronene (Cor, (191-07-1)) are major constituents of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) found in automobile exhaust and polluted air [eg, Grimmer et al, 1981]. Nitration of these PAH by NO2 and traces of HNO3, which are also formed in automobile exhaust, seems highly probable. To identify the presence of these nitroarenes in environmental samples and to examine their mutagenic potencies we synthesized and characterized nitro derivatives of both PAH. 5-NO2B(ghi)Per (81316-87-2) and 1-NO2Cor (81316-84-9) produced 405 and 340 revertants/nmole respectively in TA98 in the presence of 0.6 mg of microsomal enzymes (S-9) per plate in the Ames test. 5,8-diNO2B(ghi)Per (83292-25-5) and 5,10-diNO2B(ghi)Per (83292-26-6) produced 21,500 and 4,000 revertants/nmole in TA98 without microsomal activation. Mutagenicity for the dinitrobenzo(ghi)perylenes was also high in TA98NR and TA97 but was reduced by 97% in TA98-1,8DNP. There is close similarity in the orientation and distances between reactive sites (nitrenium ion and carbocation) on the dinitrobenzo(ghi)perylenes and 1,6-dinitropyrene (42397-64-8) and 1,8-dinitropyrene (42397-65-9)., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Curcumin (C) and its natural analogues demethoxycurcumin (dmC) and bisdemethoxycurcumin (bdmC), known for their potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic effects, were tested for their possible inhibitory effects against seven cooked food mutagens (heterocyclic amines): 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1), in both TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium using Ames Salmonella/reversion assay in the presence of Aroclor induced rat liver S9 homogenate. In the present investigations, curcumin as well as its two natural analogues i.e., dmC and bdmC were found to be highly effective in suppressing genotoxicity of all the tested cooked food mutagens in a dose-dependent manner, in both the frame shift (TA98) as well as base pair mutation sensitive (TA100) strains of S. typhimurium. However, bdmC appeared to be a relatively less active antimutagen compared to C and dmC. More than 80% inhibition of mutagenicity was observed at 200 microg/plate in case of C and dmC in both TA98 and TA100 against all tested cooked food mutagens. Where as, bdmC showed 39-79% inhibition in TA100 and 60-80% inhibition in TA98, at a dose of 200 microg/plate. These findings warrant further biochemical, enzymatic and in vivo investigations in animal models as well as in humans to establish the chemoprotective effect of these agents against mutagenic heterocyclic amines found in cooked food., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: 4-Aminobyphenyl (4-Ab), benzidine (Bz), and Bz congeners were evaluated for their ability to induce genotoxicity through an oxidative mechanism. The mutagenicity of these compounds was tested in the presence and absence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat S9 mix using Salmonella typhimurium tester strain TA102, which is sensitive to agents producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the presence of S9, 4-Ab, Bz, N-acetyl-benzidine, and 3,3-dimethoxybenzidine were strongly mutagenic in TA102, whereas, 3,3,5,5-tetra-methylbenzidine, 3,3-dimethylbenzidine (O-tolidine), and N,N-diacetylbenzidine were not mutagenic. In addition, 3,3-dichlorobenzidine and 4,4-dinitro-2-biphenylamine were directly mutagenic in TA102. Incorporation of the free radical and metal scavengers, catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), butylated hydroxytolune (BHT), and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) reduced the mutagenic responses of 4-Ab and Bz, whereas heat-inactivated catalase and SOD had no effect. 4-Ab and Bz also induced lipid peroxidation in the presence of S9 mix as shown using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay. The results of this study indicate that 4-Ab and Bz induce mutations through the induction of ROS., Yes: 0.02, No: 0.98\n",
            "Question: Human hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase, human phenol-sulfating form of phenol sulfotransferase, rat hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase a and rat phenol sulfotransferase IV were expressed in Escherichia coli. Cytosol preparations of transformed bacteria were used as activating systems in mutagenicity tests with Salmonella typhimurium TA98. All test compounds, 1-hydroxymethylpyrene, 2-hydroxymethylpyrene, 1-(1-pyrenyl)ethanol, 9-hydroxymethylanthracene, 7-hydroxymethyl-12-methylbenz[a]anthracene and 4H-cyclopenta[def]chrysen-4-ol, were activated by both hydroxysteroid sulfotransferases investigated. However, 1-(1-pyrenyl)ethanol was 67-fold more efficiently activated by the human enzyme, whereas 7-hydroxymethyl-12-methylbenz[a]anthracene was 27-fold more efficiently activated by the rat enzyme. The phenol sulfotransferases showed relatively low activities with the benzylic alcohols investigated. The only exception was 4H-cyclopenta[def]chrysen-4-ol, which was activated efficiently by rat phenol sulfotransferase IV. We had previously tested the ability of rat and human hepatic cytosol preparations to activate the same compounds. The results of a statistical analysis suggest that the activities of human hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase, rat hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase a and phenol sulfotransferase IV can account for a substantial portion of the activation of benzylic alcohols in human, female rat and male rat liver, respectively., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: To aid in the selection of chemical candidates for in vivo tests, the mutagenicity of 6 oxime compounds was evaluated in the Salmonella plate incorporation assay and mouse lymphoma L5178Y TK +/- assay. All of the oximes were mutagenic in the mouse lymphoma assay in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation. Acetaldehyde oxime was also mutagenic in the presence of S9 activation. In contrast to these results, a positive response was noted only for 2-(hydroxyimino)-N-phenyl-acetamide oxime in strain TA1535 in the absence of activation in the Salmonella/microsome test., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Amsacrine, an acridine derivative used clinically in the treatment of acute leukaemia, has formed the basis for the development of further compounds with high activity against experimental solid tumours, one of which is currently in clinical trial. We have compared the ability of these drugs to cause point mutations in bacteria, 'petite' mutations in yeast and mutations in mammalian cells. Several of the compounds are frameshift mutagens in Salmonella typhimurium TA1537 while some cause 'petite' mutagenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. All are highly clastogenic and have significant mutagenic activity at the 6-thioguanine locus in cultured V79 Chinese hamster fibroblasts following 1 h drug exposures. None are mutagenic at the ouabain locus of these cells. The relationship between different indicators of mutagenicity has been studied using an additional set of amsacrine analogues, some of which are mutagenic in S. typhimurium TA98. There is a highly significant relationship between mutation frequency (measured as resistance to 6-thioguanine) and either cytotoxicity (D37 values in a clonogenic assay) or clastogenicity (ability to induce micronuclei). However, there is no correlation with mutagenicity in microbial systems. The results suggest that the cytotoxicity, clastogenicity and mutagenic activity of the amsacrine analogues is mediated by similar mechanisms, probably involving the enzyme DNA topoisomerase II., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: During the photolysis of tryptophan a large number of products is formed. In this study, aqueous solutions of tryptophan were irradiated by ultraviolet light during 5, 20 or 40 h. Each of the irradiated batches was divided into two aliquots, which were freeze-dried or extracted with chloroform. For each batch the latter extract was subsequently divided into a purified chloroform extract and a methanol extract. Aliquots of the purified chloroform extracts were fractionated and pooled, peakwise, into seven fractions. A recombined sample was also constructed. All extracts and samples were tested for mutagenicity using the standard Ames Salmonella assay. The results indicate an exposure time dependent increase in mutagenicity of the extracts, as seen with tester strain TA100 both with and without metabolic activation. The mutagenicity of the freeze-dried extracts well approximated the mutagenicity of the chloroform extracts, indicating that most mutagenicity can be extracted with chloroform. With the fractions the highest mutagenic responses were seen in the late, i.e., less lipophilic fractions. This response pattern seen in TA98 and TA100, mainly with S9 activation, was in contrast to the response of TA102 without S9, which was highest to the more lipophilic fractions. On a fraction level, no general exposure dependent increase of mutagenicity was observed. The results also show that photooxidation of tryptophan gives rise to a different spectrum of products compared to pyrolysis. Both processes result in compounds with strong biological effects. Photooxidation results in compounds with low genotoxicity and high Ah receptor affinity while pyrolysis generates compounds with high genotoxicity and low or no Ah receptor affinity., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: A galactose- and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-specific lectin (Viscum album L. var. coloratum agglutinin, VCA), which is known for its anticancer activity, was isolated from mistletoe. In this study, we investigated the antimutagenic potentials of VCA by using the pre-incubation method of the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100) in the presence or absence of S9 mixture. Viscum album L. var. coloratum agglutinin was assessed for its antimutagenic properties against the mutagens 2-aminoanthracene (2AA) and furylfuramide (AF-2) for strain TA98, and sodium azide (NaN(3) ) and 2-aminoanthracene (2AA) for strain TA100. The concentrations used for this test compound were 100, 200 and 400 µg per plate.  Viscum album L. var. coloratum agglutinin showed moderate, but not negligible, protective effects regarding the antimutagenic properties against the direct-acting mutagens NaN(3) and AF-2. Furthermore, VCA was more effective in preventing the mutagenicity of the indirect-acting mutagen 2-AA (in the presence of S9) when tested with both TA98 and TA100. In conclusion, this report has shown broad ranging antimutagenic effects of VCA to numerous mutagens in TA98 and TA100 Salmonella typhimurium strains. Although the data presented here cannot be applied in vivo, they can support other antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic findings for VCA., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: This study aimed to determine the in vitro cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of graphene flake (GF) and aqueous graphene paste (AGP) in order to evaluate their potential for application as biomaterials. Furthermore, their antitumor activity against adherent and suspended cells, namely, human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231), and human monocytes from histiocytic lymphoma (U-937), was investigated. The results demonstrated that GF reduced the viability and proliferation of NIH3T3 immortalized murine fibroblasts for concentrations >0.8 µg/mL and incubation times of 48 and 72 h. AGP showed no toxic effects in any of the tested concentrations and incubation times. The same results were obtained for MDA-MB-231 cells. The viability of the U-937 cells was not affected by either GF or AGP. The Ames test showed that GF and AGP were not genotoxic against  Salmonella typhimurium  strains TA98 and TA100, with and without metabolic activation. The present study demonstrated good in vitro cellular compatibility of GF and AGP and. Among these, AGP was the best material as it did not interfere, at any of the tested concentrations, with cell viability and proliferation for up to 72 h of incubation. In any case, neither material induced alterations to cell morphology and were not mutagenic., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) combined with sulfuric acid is a strongly oxidizing mixture which has been recommended for the destruction and the decontamination of various mutagens/carcinogens in the publication series of the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Evaluation of the genotoxicity of 4 potassium permanganate solutions was performed using a microtechnique of the Ames test with the tester strains TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102 with and without metabolic activation. Presence of direct-acting mutagens was detected in all the samples with the tester strain TA102 without S9 mix (163-357 revertants/microliters of the solutions). Three samples containing either acetone or ethanol as an organic solvent also induced a mutagenic response on tester strain TA100 without S9 mix (167-337 revertants/microliters). In addition, DNA damage in human peripheral blood lymphocytes was also measured for one of the mixtures by a new technique: the single-cell gel assay (SCGA). A sample with no organic solvent induced DNA damage in human lymphocytes with a dose-response relationship as determined by SCGA. The major mutagenic agent generated by the permanganate solutions was found to be manganese ion (Mn2+). Both manganese sulfate (MnSO4) and manganese chloride (MnCl2) gave mutagenic dose-response relationships on tester strain TA102 without S9 mix. The mutagenic potencies were 2.8 and 2.4 revertant/nmole for MnSO4 and MnCl2 respectively. MnCl2 also induced DNA damage in human lymphocytes as determined by the SCGA. The genotoxic effects of KMnO4 in acidic conditions were probably mediated by the conversion of MnO4- to Mn2+. KMnO4 in alkaline solutions did not produce mutagenic species and may offer an alternative for the degradation of genotoxic compounds., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Recently we have shown that Salmonella typhimurium tester strains have high levels of the tripeptide glutathione (GSH) and activity of GSH S-transferases (Summer et al., 1979). In continuation of the GSH-dependent suppression of mutagenicity of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene in presence of S9 fraction (Summer et al., 1979), this paper is focused on the GSH-dependent detoxifying capacity of the bacterial tester strains. 1-Fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (FDNB), an electrophilic agent, which is used to identify terminal amino acids in proteins (Sanger reagent), readily reacts with GSH leading to a dose-dependent  depletion of bacterial GSH. Additionally, FDNB is a strong mutagen for Salmonella typhimurium TA100, TA1538, and TA98 without metabolic activation. Presumably owing to conjugation with bacterial GHS, FDNB in concentrations which were lower or equal to those of bacterial GSH were found to be not mutagenic. Accordingly, increasing amounts of bacteria in the test system require increasing amounts of FDNB for expression of mutagenicity., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: In a comparative study on 135 compounds of various chemical classes, 30 agents inducing direct nonreparable DNA damage in repair-deficient E. coli failed in reverting strains TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98 and TA100 of S. typhimurium (De Flora et al., 1984b). These compounds were re-assayed in the Ames test using strains TA97 and TA102. A dose-dependent mutagenic response was detected with aminoantipyrine and p-rosaniline in TA97 and with streptomycin and formaldehyde in TA102. p-Rosaniline was the only mutagen requiring metabolic activation. 5 compounds, i.e. o-aminophenol in TA97 and methanol, ethanol, cadmium chloride and cadmium sulfate in TA102, induced a reproducible increase in revertants over controls, but this was less than 2-fold. The remaining 21 chemicals--including amino compounds, aliphatics, aromatics, heterocycles, hydrazine derivatives and inorganics--confirmed their inactivity in the Ames test. Overall data for 135 compounds, comparing the Ames test (7 strains) and the DNA-repair test (3 strains), are re-assessed on the basis of these findings., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: We investigated the photomutagenicity of maltol (3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one) in bacterial cells. Maltol has a caramel-butterscotch odour and is used as a food additive to impart flavour to bread and cakes. Unirradiated maltol was not mutagenic up to 5 mg/plate in the Ames test. When maltol was irradiated with either UVA (a black light, 320-400 nm, 230 microW/cm(2)) for 5-30 min or UVC (a germicidal lamp, 610 microW/cm(2)) for 3 min in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) prior to the exposure of bacterial cells, it was mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium TA100, TA104 and TA97. Mutagenic activation of maltol by UVA-irradiation was more evident in neutral and alkaline conditions (pH 7.0-9.0) than in acidic conditions. On the other hand, photomutagenicity was not observed when maltol was irradiated with UVA in 100 mM NaCl solution or water. The mutagenic photoproduct was stable for at least 60 min after UVA-irradiation. However, addition of thiol compounds (cysteine or glutathione) to the UVA-irradiated maltol diminished the mutagenicity. Mutational spectrum analysis revealed that the predominant base-substitutions induced were G:C-->T:A transversions and G:C-->A:T transitions. An increase of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine formation in salmon sperm DNA exposed to maltol and UVA in vitro was detected by HPLC-ECD, but it was too small to explain the photomutagenicity. We are considering the formation of DNA adducts as the photomutagenic mechanism., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The antimutagenic activity of the methanolic extract of the fruiting bodies of Ganoderma lucidum (Fr.) P. Krast. occurring in South India was investigated. The activity was assayed by Ames Salmonella mutagenicity test using histidine mutants of Salmonella typhimurium tester strains, TA98, TA100 and TA102. The methanolic extract of the mushroom significantly inhibited (P<0.001) the in vitro sodium azide (NaN(3)), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD), and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) induced his(+) revertants in a dose dependent manner. In vivo antimutagenic activity of extract was also assayed by determining the mutagenicity of the urine of rats administrated with B[a]P as a mutagen. The prior administration of extract markedly inhibited mutagenicity induced by B[a]P. The results indicated that the methanolic extract of Ganoderma lucidum occurring in South India possessed significant antimutagenic activity. The effect of B[a]P on hepatic enzymes, such as serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and alkaline phosphtase (ALP), were also evaluated. The extract prevented the increase of SGOT, SGPT, and ALP activities consequent to B[a]P challenge, and enhanced the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). The extract also profoundly inhibited lipid peroxidation induced by B[a]P. The results revealed that Ganoderma lucidum extract restored antioxidant defense and prevented hepatic damage consequent to the challenge by B[a]P., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: A synthetic muramyl dipeptide derivative N2-[(N-acetylmuramoyl)-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl]-N6-stearoyl-L-lysine (MDP-Lys(L18), muroctasin) was studied for mutagenicity using the Ames method, in vitro cytogenetics and micronucleus test. MDP-Lys(L18) had no mutagenic effect on S. typhimurium (TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98 and TA100) or E. coli (WP2 uvrA) in the reverse mutation assay. In the cytogenetic study, MDP-Lys(L18) had no effect on the chromosomes of the Chinese hamster cells at cytotoxic doses. Single subcutaneous treatment of MDP-Lys(L18) at dose levels of 3.5, 35 or 350 mg/kg in the mouse micronucleus test did not increase the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes. These results show that MDP-Lys(L18) has no demonstrable mutagenic potential., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: 6-Dimethylaminopurine (6-DMAP) and cycloheximide have recently been used for successful production of cloned mammals. We investigated whether 6-DMAP or cycloheximide are mutagenic agents in the Ames test. Whereas cycloheximide showed no differences compared to the negative control in any of the tester strains, 6-DMAP was clearly mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535. Here, we strongly propose that innocuous chemicals be used in the production of cloned animals., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Benzidine (Bz), a human bladder carcinogen, was strongly mutagenic to Salmonella TA102 tester strain in the Ames Salmonella microsome/mutagenicity assay in the presence of rat liver S9 mix. Various non-mutagenic plant polyphenols were included in the assay to test their inhibitory effects on the Bz-induced mutations. Coumestrol, ellagic acid (EA), (-)-epicatechin (EC), (-)-epichatechingallate (ECG), gallic acid (GA), (-)-gallocatechin (GC), plumbagin, propyl gallate (PG), taxifolin, and 2,2',4'-trihydroxychalcone were found to have a strong inhibitory effect on Bz-induced mutations. (-)-Epigallo-catechingallate (EGCG), fisetin, (-)-gallocatechingallate (GCG), and piceatannol were moderately inhibitory to the mutations; whereas, (-)-catechin, (-)-catechingallate (CG), and reseveratrol were weakly inhibitory to the mutations. (-)-Epigallocatechin (EGC) and 7,3',4'-trihydroxy isoflavon were not inhibitory to the Bz-induced mutations. Isoliquirtigenin, quercetin dihydrate, and rhein were found to be mutagenic in tester strain TA102. Benzidine mediated lipid peroxidation was conducted employing the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay using linoleic acid as a substrate. In the presence of rat liver S9 mix, Bz could cause lipid peroxidation as an outcome of production of oxygen free radicals. Incorporation of the above mentioned non-mutagenic plant polyphenols significantly inhibited benzidine mediated lipid peroxidation in a time dependent manner. These polyphenols also effectively reduced the iron mediated lipid peroxidation. Thus, it is concluded that the inhibition of oxidative mutagenicity of Bz by plant polyphenols could be due to an inhibitory effect of plant polyphenols on the bioactivating enzymes such as cytochrome P-450 and peroxidase and the chelation of iron present in the cytochrome P-450 in the S9 mix. Thus, these plant polyphenols play a significant inhibitory role on Bz-induced mutagenicity., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The evaluation of the mutagenic and antimutagenic actions of extracts obtained from aerial part of Teucrium ramosissimum was assayed using the Salmonella typhimurium assay system. The effect of the same extracts on genotoxicity and SOS response induced by aflatoxin B(1) as well as nitrofurantoin was investigated in a bacterial assay system, i.e., the SOS chromotest with Escherichia coli PQ37. The different extracts showed no mutagenicity when tested with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA98 and TA1535 either with or without S9 mix. In contrast, our results prove that T. ramosissimum extracts possess antimutagenic effects against sodium azide, aflatoxin B1, benzo[a]pyrene and 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine. Moreover, the T. ramosissimum tested extracts exhibited no genotoxicity either with or without the external S9 activation mixtures. However, all the extracts significantly decreased the genotoxicity induced by aflatoxin B(1) and nitrofurantoin. The result obtained by the Ames test confirms those of SOS chromotest. Antioxidant capacity of the tested extracts was evaluated using the enzymatic (xanthine/xanthine oxidase assay) and the non enzymatic (NBT/riboflavine, DPPH and ABTS assays) systems. All extracts exhibited high antioxidant activity except the chloroform and the methanol extracts in DPPH and NBT/riboflavine assays respectively. Our results underline the potential of T. ramosissimum to avoid mutations and also its antioxidant potential., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Mutagenic activity of the promutagens 2-aminofluorene (2AF) and a contaminant of 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NOP-X) was followed in Ames Salmonella strain TA98 following metabolism by cotton and carrot cell suspension cultures using the plant cell/microbe coincubation assay. Both cell lines were capable of activating each chemical. However, activation capacities of the cell lines differed relative to their respective stage of growth when used. For 2AF activation early-log phase cotton cells and mid-log phase carrot cells proved superior while mid-log phase cotton cells and stationary phase carrot cells proved superior for NOP-X activation. These data indicate that the phase of the growth cycle at which plant cells are harvested can significantly affect their promutagen activation potential., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Dimethacrylate derivatives are used as monomers to polymerize dental composite materials and for a great variety of other industrial resins. Occupational exposure is likely in various ways because of the many areas of methacrylate application. Here, the mutagenicity of the monomers, bisphenol A-diglycidyl dimethacrylate (Bis-GMA), urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA), Bisphenol A (BPA), glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), methyl methacrylate (MMA), and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) was studied in a bacterial (Ames test) and a mammalian gene mutation assay (V79/HPRT assay). Mutagenicity was determined in different Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102) and in V79 cells in the presence and in the absence of a metabolically active microsomal fraction from rat liver (S9). No mutagenic effects were observed with Bis-GMA and UDMA, methyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate and bisphenol A. Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) was mutagenic in a dose-dependent manner in three Salmonella tester strains. The number of mutants was increased by a factor of 2 to 3 with strains TA97a and TA102 in the absence of S9. Moreover, the numbers of mutants induced in S. typhimurium TA100 were about 8-fold higher than in solvent controls. GMA also induced an increase of mutants in V79 cells in the absence of S9. However, GMA was inactivated by microsomal enzymes. Triethylenglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) was not mutagenic in any S. typhimurium. In contrast, the compound induced a dose-dependent rise in mutant frequencies in V79 cell cultures. It is concluded that TEGDMA acted through a clastogenic mechanism which is not detected by Ames tester strains., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Genotoxicities of phthalic acid (PA) and terephthalic acid (TPA) were examined using three mutagenicity tests: Ames, chromosome aberration (CA), and micronucleus (MN). In the Ames test, these two agents did not produce any mutagenic responses in the absence or presence of S9 mix on the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA102, TA1535, or TA1537. The CA test also showed that PA and TPA exerted no significant cytogenetic effect on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In the mouse MN test, no significant alteration in occurrence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was observed in ICR male mice ip administered any of these agents at doses of 0, 20, 100, 500, 2500 or 12,500 microM/kg. These results indicate that PA and TPA produced no mutagenic effects using these in vitro and in vivo mutagenic test systems., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The antimutagenic activity of the methanolic extract of the fruiting bodies of Ganoderma lucidum (Fr.) P. Krast. occurring in South India was investigated. The activity was assayed by Ames Salmonella mutagenicity test using histidine mutants of Salmonella typhimurium tester strains, TA98, TA100 and TA102. The methanolic extract of the mushroom significantly inhibited (P<0.001) the in vitro sodium azide (NaN(3)), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD), and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) induced his(+) revertants in a dose dependent manner. In vivo antimutagenic activity of extract was also assayed by determining the mutagenicity of the urine of rats administrated with B[a]P as a mutagen. The prior administration of extract markedly inhibited mutagenicity induced by B[a]P. The results indicated that the methanolic extract of Ganoderma lucidum occurring in South India possessed significant antimutagenic activity. The effect of B[a]P on hepatic enzymes, such as serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and alkaline phosphtase (ALP), were also evaluated. The extract prevented the increase of SGOT, SGPT, and ALP activities consequent to B[a]P challenge, and enhanced the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). The extract also profoundly inhibited lipid peroxidation induced by B[a]P. The results revealed that Ganoderma lucidum extract restored antioxidant defense and prevented hepatic damage consequent to the challenge by B[a]P., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Mutagenicity, co-mutagenicity and anti-mutagenicity of glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) were examined by the Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 with S9. As pro-mutagens, 2-aminoanthracene (2AA), Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), 3-amino-1-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4, 3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4, 5-f]quinoline (IQ) and 2-amino-3, 4-dimethylimidazo[4, 5-f]quinoline (MeIQ) were used. In addition to these pro-mutagens, blue-chitin extracts of human gallbladder bile (BCE) collected from the cholecystectomized patients with cholelithiasis were used in order to investigate the role of GUDCA on mutagen(s) actually existing in human bile. It was found that GUDCA did not show mutagenicity in this test system. Concerning the modification of mutagenic activities of pro-mutagens, GUDCA showed the different directions. GUDCA acted as co-mutagen, since it enhanced the mutagenic activities of 2AA and BaP. But, acted as anti-mutagen, since it suppressed the activities of Trp-P-2, IQ and MeIQ, all of which were classified as heterocyclic amines. GUDCA also suppressed the mutagen(s) in human bile. Because of the use of blue-chitin absorbed method for testing bile mutagenicity, the chemicals involved were considered to be heterocyclic amines and other polycyclic compounds. In these we suspect the bile mutagens are heterocyclic amines. Further examination should be directed towards the investigation into the mechanism of anti-mutagenic effects of GUDCA on mutagen(s) actually existing in human bile., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Soybean acid hydrolyzed extracts are raw-materials widely used for manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics products due to their high content of isoflavone aglycones. In the present study, the main sugar degradation products 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (HMF) and 5-ethoxymethyl-2-furfural (EMF) were quantitatively determined after acid hydrolysis of extracts from different soybean cultivars by a validated liquid chromatography method. The furanic compounds determined in samples cover the range of 0.16-0.21mg/mL and 0.22-0.33mg/mL for HMF and EMF, respectively. Complementarily, due to the scarce literature regarding the EMF toxicology, this study also assessed the EMF mutagenicity by the Salmonella/microsome test and genotoxicity by the comet assay. The results revealed that EMF did not show mutagenicity at the range of 50-5000μg/plate in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA97a, TA100, TA102 and TA1535, but induced DNA damage in HepG2 cells at non-cytotoxic doses of 0.1-1.3mg/mL, mainly by oxidative stress mechanisms. Based on literature of HMF genotoxicity, and considering the EMF genotoxicity results herein shown, purification procedures to remove these impurities from extracts are recommended during healthcare products development to ensure the security of the products. , Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Four prenylated flavanones were isolated from the methanol extract of the flowers of Azadirachta indica (the neem tree) as potent antimutagens against Trp-P-1 (3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole) in the Salmonella typhimurium TA98 assay by activity-guided fractionation. Spectroscopic properties revealed that those compounds were 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-8-prenylflavanone (1), 5,4'-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-8-prenylflavanone (2), 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3',8-diprenylflavanone (3), and 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3',5'-diprenylflavanone (4). All isolated compounds were found for the first time in this plant. The antimutagenic IC(50) values of compounds 1-4 were 2.7 +/- 0.1, 3.7 +/- 0.1, 11.1 +/- 0.1, and 18.6 +/- 0.1 microM in the preincubation mixture, respectively. These compounds also similarly inhibited the mutagenicity of Trp-P-2 (3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole) and PhIP (2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine). All of the compounds 1-4 strongly inhibited ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylation activity of cytochrome P450 1A isoforms, which catalyze N-hydroxylation of heterocyclic amines. However, compounds 1-4 did not show significant inhibition against the direct-acting mutagen NaN(3). Thus, the antimutagenic effect of compounds 1-4 would be mainly based on the inhibition of the enzymatic activation of heterocyclic amines., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The Ames assay employing Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98 was used to investigate potential interactions between aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and the phenolic antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyanisole, and propyl gallate. AFB1 doses were within the linear response range, and the antioxidants were used at levels of 0 to 50 micrograms per plate. All three antioxidants were nonmutagenic in either bacterial tester strain, with or without the hepatic S-9 enzyme preparation; toxic effects were observed at doses higher than 20 micrograms per plate. Butylated hydroxytoluene and butylated hydroxyanisole substantially increased AFB1-induced mutagenesis in the two tester strains with microsomal activation. The addition of 5 to 20 micrograms of butylated hydroxytoluene or hydroxyanisole to 5 to 20 ng of AFB1 per plate caused more than a twofold increase in the number of His+ revertants. Addition of propyl gallate resulted in only a moderate increase in the number of revertants. Whereas several anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic effects by phenolic antioxidants have been reported, particularly in studies with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the enhancement of mutagenic potency of AFB1 by these compounds suggests a specificity with respect to the chemical nature of AFB1., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: For ages, lichens have long been investigated popularly for biological roles, mainly antitumor, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Many positive results were obtained in these previous research. Thus, in this study, we aimed to determine whether extracts of Usnea articulata (UAE) and Usnea filipendula (UFE) possessing a protection against aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-induced genotoxic and oxidative damage. The results of our studies showed that 5 μM concentrations of AFB1 increased the frequencies of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). However, when 5, 10 and 20 µg/mL concentrations of UAE and UFE was added to AFB1, the frequencies of SCE and MDA level were decreased and SOD, GSH and GPx level were increased. The Ames (Salmonella typhimurium TA1535, TA1537) and WP2 (Escherichia coli) test systems carried out evinced that UAE and UFE possess any mutagenicity, but have antimutagenic effects. Consequently, the results of this experiment have clearly shown that UAE and UFE have strong antioxidative and antigenotoxic effects that are associated with its antioxidant nature. A detailed study can be performed to determine the antioxidant properties of each compound that will extend the use of lichen extracts in food and pharmacy industries., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The genotoxic environmental contaminant 1-nitropyrene is metabolised in mammalian systems by pathways more complex than the straightforward nitroreduction which accounts for most of its biological activity in bacteria. In order to evaluate the role of O-acetyltransferase (OAT) activity in generation of genotoxic intermediates from 1-nitropyrene, the mutagenicity of the major primary oxidised metabolites of 1-nitropyrene was characterised in the Ames Salmonella typhimurium plate incorporation assay with strain TA98, and with variants of TA98 deficient (TA98/1,8-DNP6) or enhanced (YG1024) in O-acetyltransferase. 1-Nitropyren-3-ol was more mutagenic in the absence than in the presence of S9, while 1-nitropyren-4-ol, 1-nitropyren-6-ol and 1-nitropyren-8-ol required S9 for maximum expression of mutagenicity. 1-Nitropyren-4-ol (176 rev/nmol without S9, 467 rev/nmol with S9 in TA98) and 1-nitropyren-6-ol (13 rev/nmol without S9, 266 rev/nmol with S9 in TA98) were overall the most potent nitropyrenol isomers assayed. 1-Acetamidopyren-8-ol and 1-acetamidopyrene 4,5-quinone were only minimally active. 1-Acetamidopyren-3-ol exhibited direct-acting mutagenicity. 1-Acetamidopyren-6-ol, previously shown to be a major contributor to mutagenicity in the urines of rats dosed with 1-nitropyrene (Ball et al., 1984b), was confirmed as a potent (359 rev/nmol) S9-dependent mutagen. Both the direct-acting and the S9-dependent mutagenicity of all the compounds studied was enhanced in the OAT-overproducing strain and much diminished (though not always entirely lost) in the OAT-deficient strain, showing that OAT amplifies expression of the genotoxicity of these compounds. 1-Acetamidopyren-6-ol required both S9 and OAT activity in order to exhibit any mutagenicity; this finding strongly implicates N-hydroxylation followed by O-esterification, as opposed to further S9-catalyzed ring oxidation, as a major route of activation for urinary metabolites of 1-nitropyrene., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Acylfulvenes are a class of antitumor agents derived from illudin S, a sesquiterpenoid toxin isolated from mushrooms of the genus Omphalotus. Although DNA appears to be their major target, no data concerning mutagenicity of acylfulvenes are available in the literature, and limited data have been published on illudin S. Enzyme-mediated biotransformations have been demonstrated to influence the cytotoxicity of acylfulvenes. Illudin S and some acylfulvenes [e.g., (-)-6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (HMAF)] are allylic alcohols with potential for enhanced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity by means of metabolic sulfation. Therefore, we studied the influence of various heterologously expressed human sulfotransferases (SULTs) on biological activities of illudin S and HMAF in bacterial and mammalian cells. (-)-Acylfulvene (AF) was tested as a congener lacking an allylic hydroxyl group. We found: (1) all three compounds were mutagenic in standard Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100 and TA104; (2) they induced gene mutations (at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase locus) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in Chinese hamster V79 cells; (3) these effects were practically unaffected when human SULTs were expressed in the target bacteria or mammalian cells (using SCE as the endpoint); (4) illudin S demonstrated 40-600 times higher genotoxic activities than the semisynthetic acylfulvenes studied; it was positive in the SCE test even at a concentration of 0.3 nM; (5) genotoxicity in mammalian cells was observed at substantially lower concentrations of the compounds than required for a positive result in the bacterial test (400 nM with illudin S). We conclude that illudin S, HMAF and AF are potent genotoxicants and human SULTs do not play a significant role in their bioactivation. , Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The current study aims to determine the genotoxic and antigenotoxic potential of four newly synthesized dihydropyridine derivatives using Escherichia coli WP2 and Ames/Salmonella bacterial reversion assay systems. The bacterial mutant tester strains, E. coli WP2uvrA with a point mutation and Salmonella typhimurium TA1537 with a frameshift mutation, were used to determine genotoxic potentials of the test compounds. To determine antigenotoxic potentials of the test compounds, the same strains were also used together with positive mutagens N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) for E. coli WP2uvrA and 9-aminoacridine (9-AA) for S. typhimurium TA1537. According to the results, neither of the test compounds showed significant genotoxic activity on both tester strains at the tested concentrations. However, except compound 4, all the test compounds showed significant antigenotoxic activity on MNNG- or/and 9-AA-induced mutations. The inhibition rates of mutagenesis ranged from 27.0% (compound 2: 2.5 mM/plate) to 65.0% (compound 2: 0.5 mM/plate) for MNNG and from 30.6% (compound 2: 2 mM/plate) to 58.5% (compound 1: 1 mM/plate) for 9-AA genotoxicity. According to these results, it is concluded that all the test compounds do not have a mutagenic potential on the bacterial strains at the tested concentrations, and some of them have antigenotoxic potentials against MNNG- and 9-AA-induced mutagenesis. , Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Hepatic microsomal fractions (microsomes) were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats. The effect of arachidonic acid on the conversion of the heterocyclic aromatic amine 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) to its genotoxic metabolites was investigated using a modified bacterial mutation assay (indicator: Salmonella typhimurium TA98). Arachidonic acid inhibited the mutagenicity of IQ without effect on the uptake of the active metabolites and/or on the DNA-repair processes within the bacterial cell. The activation of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was also inhibited by this polyunsaturated fatty acid., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Benzimidazole derivatives have a diverse range of biological activities, including antiulcer, antihypertensive, antiviral, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer. Despite these activities, previous studies have revealed that some of the derivatives can induce mutations. This study aimed to screen for potential mutagenic activities of novel benzimidazole derivatives 1-4 using the Ames test and to study their structure-activity relationship (SAR). An Ames test was carried out on two strains of  Salmonella typhimurium  (TA98 and TA100) in the absence and presence of metabolic activation. Genetic analysis was performed prior to the Ames test to determine the genotypes of the bacterial tester strains. Both bacterial strains showed dependency on histidine with the presence of  rfa  mutation,  uvr B deletion, and plasmid pKM101. Further, all derivatives tested showed no mutagenic activity in the absence of metabolic activation in both tester strains. However, in the presence of metabolic activation, compound 1 appeared to induce mutation at 2.5 µg/plate when tested against the TA98 strain. These results suggest that the absence of the -OH group at the  ortho -position over the phenyl ring might be the cause of increased mutagenic activity in compound 1. Additionally, the presence of mutagenic activity in compound 1 when it was metabolically activated indicates that this compound is a promutagen., Yes: 0.14, No: 0.86\n",
            "Question: N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione were negative in the Ames test with 7 Salmonella strains, while L-cysteine was activated by rat liver S-9 fractions to metabolites mutagenic to strains TA102, TA97 and TA100. The mutagenic response in S. typhimurium strains (TA1535, TA98, TA100, TA102) and the levels of enzyme activities, responsible for NADP+ or GSSG reduction and for the utilization of NADPH or GSH in rat liver S-9 fractions, were investigated following in vitro preincubation of NAC with four direct-acting mutagens and six procarcinogens. Treatment with this nucleophilic and reducing compound resulted in a dose-related decrease of the direct mutagenicity of epichlorohydrin, hydrogen peroxide and, sharply, of 4-nitroquinolino-N-oxide and sodium dichromate. The mutagenicity of these compounds, both in the absence and in the presence of NAC, was decreased by rat liver S-9 fractions and to some extent by lung S-9 fractions. A diphasic effect was observed in the case of procarcinogens (cyclophosphamide, 2-aminofluorene, cigarette smoke condensate, Trp-P-2, aflatoxin B1 and benzo[a]pyrene), i.e., an enhancement of S-9 requiring mutagenicity at intermediate NAC doses, which could be ascribed to metabolic factors acting in vitro, and a loss of mutagenicity at high NAC doses, which could be ascribed to trapping of electrophilic metabolites. Out of the five S-9 enzyme activities under study, i.e., glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, GSH peroxidase and GSSG reductase, only the last one showed significant changes following mutagen and/or NAC treatment., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Allyl isothiocyanate, a naturally occurring compound, component of oil of mustard and human food plants such as cabbage, cauliflower and horseradish, has up to now been regarded as nonmutagenic in bacterial mutagenicity testing systems. Recently, however, it was found to cause transitional-cell papillomas in the urinary bladder of male F344 rats. Contrary to earlier reports, in this study allyl isothiocyanate showed clear mutagenicity for Salmonella typhimurium TA100 in the preincubation assay after longer, non-standard preincubation times (greater than 20 min). The mutagenicity is expressed only in the presence of a rat-liver homogenate metabolising system, i.e. it is indirect. However, high concentrations of rat-liver homogenate suppress the mutagenicity of allyl isothiocyanate. SKF525, inhibitor of microsomal oxygenase, reduces the mutagenic potential which on the other hand is increased in the presence of 1,1,1-trichloropropene-2-oxide, inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase. This indicates the occurrence of an epoxide intermediate in allyl isothiocyanate metabolism. Another metabolic pathway, namely hydrolysis to allyl alcohol and oxidation to acrolein, a known mutagen, also seems possible as cyanamide, inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase, can slightly increase the mutagenic potential. The reason(s) for allyl isothiocyanate's requirement for long preincubation times to express mutagenicity still requires elucidation, and the question arises: is allyl isothiocyanate a single, exceptional case or not?, Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Previously, Alternaria extract and metabolite mutagenicities+/-nitrosylation were characterized using Ames Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100, which are both reverted at GC sites. To examine other targets for mutation, the metabolites Altertoxin I (ATX I), Altenuene (ALT), Alternariol (AOH), Alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), Tentoxin (TENT), Tenuazonic acid (TA) and Radicinin (RAD) were reexamined+/-nitrosylation, using Ames Salmonella strain TA97, sensitive to frameshift mutations at a run of C's, as well as strains TA102 and TA104, reverted by base pair mutations at AT sites and more sensitive to oxidative damage. ATX I was also assessed for mammalian mutagenicity at the Hprt gene locus in Chinese hamster V79 lung fibroblasts and rat hepatoma H4IIE cells. When tested from 1 to 100 microg/plate without nitrosylation, ATX I was mutagenic in TA102+/-rat liver S9 for activation and weakly mutagenic in TA104+/-S9, demonstrating direct-acting AT base pair mutagenicity. AOH was also directly mutagenic at AT sites in TA102+/-S9 while AME was weakly mutagenic in TA102+/-S9 and TA104+S9. Nitrosylation of ATX I enhanced mutagenicity at AT sites in TA104+/-S9 but produced little change in TA102+/-S9 compared to native ATX I. However, nitrosylated ATX I generated a potent direct-acting frameshift mutagen at C sites in TA97+/-S9. While ATX I was not mutagenic in either V79 cells or H4IIE cells, 5 and 10 microg/ml nitrosylated ATX I produced a doubling of 6-thioguanine resistant V79 colonies and 0.5 and 1 microg/ml were mutagenic to H4IIE cells, becoming toxic at higher concentrations. These results suggest ATX I, AME and AOH induce mutations at AT sites, possibly through oxidative damage, with nitrosylation enhancing ATX I frameshift mutagenicity at runs of C's. Nitrosylated ATX I was also directly mutagenic in mammalian test systems., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) is a product of lipid peroxidation. In the presence of t-butyl hydroperoxide the racemic HNE readily converts to its epoxide, 2,3-epoxy-4-hydroxynonanal (EH), as a pair of diastereomers. In this study, the potential roles of HNE and EH as tumor initiating agents were assessed. The mutagenicities of HNE and EH isomers in Salmonella strains TA100 and 104 were examined. In addition, the tumor initiating activities of HNE and EH were evaluated in bioassays involving either topical application in CD-1 mice or i.p. administration in newborn CD-1 mice. In the mutagenicity assays, EH isomers induced similar levels of revertants in both tester strains, although EG isomers were previously shown to react with bases in DNA with different specificity (Sodum, R.S. and Chung, F.-L., Cancer Res., 51, 137-143, 1991). The major isomer induced approximately 20,000 revertants/mumol in TA100 and 15,000 revertants/mumol in TA104, whereas, the minor isomer induced approximately 40,000 revertants/mumol in TA100 and 20,000 revertants/mumol in TA104. HNE was, however, not mutagenic under the assay conditions. In the tumor bioassays, EH was a weak tumorigen in CD-1 mice upon topical application followed by TPA promotion, yielding 0.55 tumors/mouse and 40% tumor incidence at a total dose of 128 mumol/mouse versus 0.02 tumors/mouse and 5% tumor incidence in the control group. Both HNE and EH induced liver tumors in male mice, but not in female mice. However, the incidences were not statistically significant. EH administered i.p. at a total dose of 200 nmol/mouse exacerbated the chronic spontaneous nephropathy in newborn CD-1 mice. Although the incidence of mild nephropathy was comparable in both EH-treated and control groups, the incidence of more severe lesions in mice treated with 200 nmol/mouse was 21%; while it was 0% in the control group. Furthermore, two mice at each dose level of EH showed a tubule profile with complex hyperplastic lining, suggestive of atypical hyperplasia. Again, HNE was not as active as EH in these bioassays. These results suggest a possible role of EH in tumorigenesis associated with lipid peroxidation., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Paper strips containing indicator dyes have been developed by defence scientists to change color upon exposure to certain agents but not to common solvents. As a preliminary step in studies on their possible genetic or carcinogenic hazard, 6 dyes used in these detection papers were tested with the Salmonella/mammalian-microsome assay. The 3 nitro arenes tested were found to be mutagenic. Two of them, Orasol Navy Blue 2RB (without metabolic activation) and Eastman Fast Blue B-GLF (with metabolic activation), induced higher yields of mutations in the frameshift revertible strains, but base substitution mutations also were found. The third nitro arene, ethyl-bis-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) acetate, induced only frameshift reversions, the greatest yields without metabolic activation. Because of weak but consistent mutagenic activation. Because of weak but consistent mutagenic effects with a fourth dye, thiodiphenyl-4,4'-diazo-bis-salicylic acid, fluctuation tests using Salmonella strain TA98 were performed, and dose-related, statistically-significant mutagenic responses were observed. Two remaining dyes, Fluorescent Brilliant Yellow R and 2,5,2',5'-tetramethyltriphenylmethane-4,4'-diazo-bis-beta-hydroxynaphthoic anilide, were not mutagenic in experiments using doses extending into the toxic range. Spot tests were performed on different paper strips containing the dyes. When the papers were eluted with dimethyl sulfoxide, responses were found to be qualitatively similar to those in the plate tests. Although microbial test results cannot be used to assess risk in man, these results indicate a potential mutagenic or carcinogenic hazard for individuals exposed to these dyes, especially the nitro aromatics., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Workplaces of an Italian carbon electrode factory, exposed to petroleum pitch and petroleum coke, were studied using a coupled chemical and biological approach to evaluate occupational mutagenic/carcinogenic hazards. Analytical procedures for the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity tests (with TA98 and TA100 strains) were performed on both industrial ingredients (pitch and coke) and airborne particulate matter of the working environment, after fractionating by sequential Soxhlet extractions with four organic solvents of increasing polarity (benzene, chloroform, methanol and acetone). The results showed: (a) the presence of extraordinarily high PAH (carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic) contents in the benzene extracts of petroleum pitch (3.6 wt% of total PAH) and of airborne particulate samples (up to 0.35 wt% of total PAH), in correlation with very high indirect (after metabolic activation) mutagenic responses of benzene extracts with strain TA98; (b) very high indirect mutagenic responses in the other extracts of the airborne particulate samples (especially with strain TA98); (c) the production during the processing at high temperatures of directly acting mutagens (without metabolic activation) which were absent in the starting materials and their release in the air of workplaces. The comparison of chemical analytical and mutagenicity data has proved to be an interesting approach for better defining the relative health hazards due to occupational exposure to potentially mutagenic/carcinogenic petroleum products., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The ability of the plant phenol ellagic acid to inhibit the mutagenicity of the food mutagen IQ was evaluated using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the Ames mutagenicity test. Ellagic acid caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the S-9- and microsome-mediated mutagenicity of IQ. The plant phenol did not interact directly with the IQ-derived mutagenic species and did not modify the cytosol-mediated activation of the promutagen. At the concentrations used in the mutagenicity studies, ellagic acid failed to inhibit microsomal mixed-function oxidase activity, including that mediated by the P450I family responsible for the bioactivation of IQ, despite being an essentially planar molecule as indicated by computer-graphic analysis. The inhibitory effect of ellagic acid was independent of its ability to chelate Mg2+. However, pre-incubation of ellagic acid with the bacteria, followed by removal of the plant phenol, did not completely prevent the inhibitory effect of the phenol on the mutagenicity of IQ. Intraperitoneal administration of ellagic acid to rats caused a decrease in total cytochrome P-450 levels and related activities as well as in cytosolic glutathione S-transferase activity. Finally, the possibility that the reported anticarcinogenic action of ellagic acid reflects nothing more than non-selective destruction of hepatic cytochromes P-450, and thus reduced chemical activation, is considered., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Touchi, a traditional Chinese food used mainly for seasoning is obtained by first steaming soybeans followed by fermentation with Aspergillus oryzae (koji). A series of toxicological studies was conducted to evaluate the mutagenic and genotoxic potential and subchronic toxicity of a water extract of Touchi, a known inhibitor of alpha -glucosidase activity. Touchi extract (TE) did not induce reverse mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA1537, TA100, TA1535, and Escherichia coli WP2uvrA at concentrations up to 5000 microg/plate, in either the absence or presence of exogenous metabolic activation. No deaths occurred and no abnormal clinical signs were observed in any animal in any group in an in vivo micronucleus test, and TE was devoid of clastogenic activity when administered orally to mice at doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day. Thus, TE was evaluated as negative in the bacterial reverse mutation and mouse bone marrow micronucleus tests under the conditions of these assays. To evaluate its subchronic toxicity, SPF rats were administered TE at doses of 0, 250, 1000, and 2500 mg/kg/day via oral gastric intubation. No treatment-related toxic changes were seen in clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, urinalysis, hematology, blood chemistry, necropsy, organ weight, or histopathology. The no observed adverse effect level for TE was thus considered to be more than 2500 mg/kg/day in both males and females. These results are consistent with Touchi's status as a traditional Chinese food derived from fermented soybeans and its purported long history of use. Specifically, these data are consistent with the expected safety of human consumption of TE up to at least 5 g/day., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The Ames assay employing Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98 was used to investigate potential interactions between aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and the phenolic antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyanisole, and propyl gallate. AFB1 doses were within the linear response range, and the antioxidants were used at levels of 0 to 50 micrograms per plate. All three antioxidants were nonmutagenic in either bacterial tester strain, with or without the hepatic S-9 enzyme preparation; toxic effects were observed at doses higher than 20 micrograms per plate. Butylated hydroxytoluene and butylated hydroxyanisole substantially increased AFB1-induced mutagenesis in the two tester strains with microsomal activation. The addition of 5 to 20 micrograms of butylated hydroxytoluene or hydroxyanisole to 5 to 20 ng of AFB1 per plate caused more than a twofold increase in the number of His+ revertants. Addition of propyl gallate resulted in only a moderate increase in the number of revertants. Whereas several anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic effects by phenolic antioxidants have been reported, particularly in studies with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the enhancement of mutagenic potency of AFB1 by these compounds suggests a specificity with respect to the chemical nature of AFB1., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Molds of the genus Alternaria are common food pathogens responsible for the spoilage of fruits, vegetables, grains, and nuts. Although consumption of Alternaria alternata-contaminated foodstuffs has been implicated in an elevated incidence of esophageal carcinogenesis, the mutagenic potencies of several A. alternata toxins seem unable to account for the levels of activity found using crude mycelial extracts. In this study, the mutagenic effects of nitrosylation were examined with the major Alternaria metabolites Altenuene (ALT), Alternariol (AOH), Alternariol Monomethyl Ether (AME), Altertoxin I (ATX I), Tentoxin (TENT), Tenuazonic Acid (TA), and Radicinin (RAD) using the Ames Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100. In the absence of nitrosylation, ATX I was mutagenic when tested from 1 to 100 microg/plate in TA98 with rat liver S9 for activation, while AOH and ATX I were weakly mutagenic +/- S9 in TA100. Incubation with nitrite generally increased mutagenic potencies with ATX I strongly mutagenic +/- S9 in both TA98 and TA100, while ALT, AOH, AME, and RAD responses were enhanced in TA100 + S9. However, subsequent examination of three extracts made from A. alternata culture broth, acetone-washed mycelia, and the acetone washes showed a different mutagenic response with both broth and acetone washes directly mutagenic in TA98 and TA100 but with a reduced response + S9. The acetone-washed mycelial extract was found to have the lowest mutagenic activity of the three extracts tested. Nitrosylation had little effect on the mutagenicity of any of the extracts. Thus, while nitrosylation increases the mutagenicity of ATX I, and to a lesser extent that of several other Alternaria toxins, the results demonstrate that Alternaria produces a major mutagenic activity with a S. typhimurium response different from that found with the purified toxins. Efforts are currently underway to chemically identify this mutagenic species. Published 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The mutagenicity of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (24DNT), and 2,6-dinitrotoluene (26DNT), and their related transformation products such as hydroxylamine and amine derivatives, which are formed by Clostridium acetobutylicum, were tested in crude cell extracts using Salmonella typhimurium TA100. A previous publication already reported the mutagenic activities of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and its related hydroxylamine derivatives in this test system. A time course of the mutagenicity during the anaerobic transformation of TNT, 24DNT, and 26DNT was also investigated under the same conditions to compare with the results from the pure compounds. The monohydroxylamino intermediates 2-hydroxylamino-4-nitrotoluene (2HA4NT), 4-hydroxylamino-2-nitrotoluene (4HA2NT) and 2-hydroxylamino-6-nitrotoluene (2HA6NT) formed during anaerobic transformation of dinitrotoluenes were proven to be mutagenic in the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA100. This study reports that 4HA2NT is the most stable derivative, whereas 2HA4NT and 2HA6NT are less stable and these intermediates are mutagenic in the Ames test. Both 24DNT and 26DNT and their final metabolites 2,4-diaminotoluene (24DAT) and 2,6-aminotoluene (26DAT) appeared nonmutagenic. In a time-course study of TNT degradation, the temporal sample containing 85% of 2,4-dihydroxylamino-6-nitrotoluene (24HA6NT) is most mutagenic. These observations suggest that the bioremediation approach for treatment of 24DNT and 26DNT should be carried past the hydroxylamino intermediate., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The genotoxic and mutagenic effects of two commonly used organochlorine pesticides, lindane (LND) and endosulfan (ENS), and two commonly used organophosphate pesticides, chlorpyrifos (CPF) and monocrotophos (MCP) were assessed using in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test and in vitro Ames Salmonella/ microsome mutagenicity test. The results showed that these pesticides alone or in combination, induced significantly high frequency of micronuclei (MN) formation that increased with concentration of pesticides. All these four pesticides produced significant increase in the frequencies of micronucleated-polychromatic erythrocytes (MN-PCE) and decrease infrequencies of PCE in dose-dependent manner. The results indicate the suppression of proliferative activity of the bone marrow and increase in the extent of cell death. ENS and MCP showed mutagenic potential in Salmonella/ microsome assay. ENS induced mutagenic and nontoxic response only in TA98 tester strain of S.typhimurium at the dose of 500 μg/plate and in the absence of metabolic activation. MCP showed weak mutagenic and nontoxic effect only in TA100 tester strain at the dose of 5000 μg/plate in both assays, with or without metabolic activation when compared with negative control. MCP was toxic in TA98 tester strain at the dose of 5000 μg/plate in absence of metabolic activation while reduction in toxicity was seen on addition of S9 mixture. The study clearly showed the genotoxic potential of all these four pesticides and mutagenic response of endosulfan and monocrotophos., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: In a previous report we described the ability of cyclohexanol to induce CYP activity. In order to characterize this induction we tested the capacity of liver S9 from rats orally treated with cyclohexanol for 5 days, to activate several carcinogenic nitrosamines into mutagens in the Salmonella typhimurium TA100 test system. Additionally, Western blot analysis of hepatic microsomes from the same treated animals were analysed with specific antibodies against P450 protein families 1A1/A2, 2B1/B2 and 2E1. Cyclohexanol-S9 mixture was more efficient in activating the following nitrosamines: N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodipropylamine (NDPA), N-nitrosomethylpropylamine (NMPA), N-nitrosodibutylamine (NDBA), and N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) into bacterial mutagens than S9 from non-treated animals. The mutagenicity of N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) was not modified in the presence of S9 from cyclohexanol-treated animals. Since the main metabolic pathway leading to the production of mutagenic intermediates of NDMA and NPYR is catalysed by isozyme CYP2E1 and that of NDPA, NMPA and NDBA by CYP2B1/B2, mutagenicity experiments predicted that cyclohexanol induces these two P450 isozyme families. Western blot analysis confirmed the results of the mutagenicity assay, showing an increase in the intensity of CYP2E1 and CYP2B1/B2 protein bands in hepatic microsomes from cyclohexanol treated rats in comparison with non-treated controls. Bacterial mutagenicity tests with specific pro-mutagens were good predictors of the P450 induction properties of cyclohexanol., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: A methanol extract from Pogostemon cablin showed a suppressive effect on umu gene expression of SOS response in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 against the mutagen 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (furylfuramide). The methanol extract was re-extracted with hexane, dichloromethane, butanol, and water. A dichloromethane fraction showed a suppressive effect. Suppressive compounds against furylfuramide in the dichloromethane fraction were isolated by SiO(2) column chromatography and identified as 7,4'-di-O-methyleriodictyol (1), 7, 3',4'-tri-O-methyleriodictyol (2), and 3,7,4'-tri-O-methylkaempferol (3). In addition, three flavonoids, ombuine (4), pachypodol (5), and kumatakenin (6), were isolated and identified from the dichrolomethane fraction. Compounds 1 and 3 suppressed >50% of the SOS-inducing activity at <0.6 micromol/mL, and the ID(50) values of both compounds were 0.25 micromol/mL. Compound 2 showed a weakly suppressive effect (17%) at a concentration of 0.6 micromol/mL, and compounds 4-6 did not. These compounds were also assayed with 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), which requires liver metabolizing enzymes. Compounds 3-6 suppressed >80% of the SOS-inducing activity of Trp-P-1 at <0.06 micromol/mL, and compounds 1 and 2 suppressed 87 and 63% at a concentration of 0.3 micromol/mL. In addition, these compounds were assayed with activated Trp-P-1, and the suppressed effects of these compounds were further decreased when compared to Trp-P-1. The antimutagenic activities of these compounds against furylfuramide, Trp-P-1, and activated Trp-P-1 were assayed by the Ames test using S. typhimurium TA100., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Chemical fractions from 4 shale oils including one produced in an above-ground retort (Paraho), 2 produced below ground by in situ method (Occidental and Geokinetics), and 1 produced by a simulated modified in situ process (Livermore), were tested for mutagenicity against Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames assay system. Their mutagenic activities were compared with 2 other complex materials: a high-boiling coal distillate (The Solvent Refined Coal Process I (SRC II) heavy distillate), and a crude petroleum (Prudhoe Bay). Each material was fractionated by Sephadex LH-20 partition chromatography and by acid-base solvent extraction to provide chemical fractions for bioassay. Mutagenic activity was detected in the coal liquid (and their fractions), but not in the natural crude oil nor in any of its fractions. The basic and tar fractions derived by solvent extraction, and the LH-20 methanol fractions contained most of the mutagenic activity recovered from the unfractionated material. The heavy distillate was approx. 10 times more active in the Ames assay than the most mutagenically active shale oil. The most mutagenically active of the shale oils was about 10 times more active than the least active shale oil., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Azathioprine is a direct acting mutagen in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA1535. Addition of rat liver S9 fraction with or without co-factors, or glutathione, causes a decrease in the mutagenicity of azathioprine in TA100 and an increase in TA1535, indicating the effect of SH groups., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The antimutagenicity of ethanol extracts of bee glue (propolis) (EEBG) was evaluated, using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 as a test model, against two direct mutagens, 4-nitro-O-phenylenediamine (4-NO) and 1-nitropyrene (1-NP), and two indirect mutagens, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) with S9 mix. EEBG was shown to suppress the mutagenicity of these compounds in a dose-dependent fashion. To delineate the mechanism of action of the antimutagenic effects of EEBG on the two indirect mutagens IQ and B[a]P, two possible points of blocking were considered: (1) cytochrome P-450 activity (route 1) and (2) interaction with microsome-generated proximate mutagens to generate an inactive complex (route 2). Our results clearly demonstrated, at a very low dose, remarkable suppression of the mutagenicity of both compounds by inhibiting either route 1 or route 2 pathway. Further studies indicated that EEBG was capable of inhibiting both the activities of hepatic cytochrome P-450 IA1-linked 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and IA 2-linked 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase (ECD) in a similar dose-dependent manner. Taken together, we demonstrated that EEBG was a good inhibitor for mutagenicity of direct mutagens, 1-NP and 4-NO, as well as for the indirect mutagens IQ and B[a]P in the presence of S9 mix via inactivation of microsomal enzyme activities (e.g. EROD and ECD) or antagonizing metabolic generation of the proximate mutagens of IQ and B[a]P., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: 2-Chlorocinnamaldehyde and 2-bromocinnamaldehyde, compounds of practical interest, for example, as bacteriocides and fungicides or for utilization in light sensitive layers, were tested in the Ames preincubation test with various Salmonella typhimurium strains, and in the SOS chromotest with Escherichia coli PQ 37.2-Chlorocinnamaldehyde was clearly mutagenic in strain TA 100 (6081 revertants/mumol) and in strain TA 98 (3050 revertants/mumol) without S9 mix, and was clearly positive in the SOS chromotest (SOSIP = 0.181). 2-Bromocinnamaldehyde was a strong mutagen in strain TA 100 (105, 500 revertants/mumol), in strain TA98 (41567 revertants/mumol) and in strain TA 1538 (15825 revertants/mumol), and also unambiguously mutagenic in strain TA 1535 (2110 revertants/mumol) without S9 mix. The SOSIP in the SOS chromotest was 1.5. Addition of S9 mix led to a marked decrease in the mutagenic activity of 2-bromocinnamaldehyde in all strains tested. In the case of strain TA 1535, mutagenic activity was abolished or not significant in the presence of S9 mix. The possible primary mechanisms underlying these mutagenic effects are discussed. Frame-shift activity of these halocinnamaldehydes can be explained by their planar structure., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Antimutagenic activities of hexane extracts obtained from the fruit extract (UE) and the Kernels (KE) of P. mume were examined. These extracts showed inhibitory activities to known mutagens, 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide, benzo[alpha]pyrene and aflatoxin B1 in the Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98 strains. The UE and KE fractions were then separated by silicic acid column chromatography with a stepwise elution method using ether-hexane. The location of the active substances in the fractions was also determined by thin-layer chromatography. Consequently, it was found that the effective substances for the desmutagenicity were fatty acids, and identified by gas liquid chromatography, mainly as oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid in UE, and mainly as oleic acid and linoleic acid in KE, respectively., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The effect of arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid on the conversion of the heterocyclic amine 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) to its genotoxic metabolites was investigated using a modified bacterial mutation assay. The assay used Salmonella typhimurium TA98 as an indicator of the mutagenicity and hepatic post-mitochondrial fractions (S-9) from male Sprague-Dawley rats as the activating system. All three fatty acids inhibited the mutagenicity of IQ without effect on the uptake of the active metabolites and/or on the DNA repair processes within the bacterial cell. The activation of three other food mutagens, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was also inhibited by these fatty acids., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: 1-Hydroxymethylpyrene (HMP), a primary benzylic alcohol, and 4H-cyclopenta[def]chrysen-4-ol (OH-CPC), a secondary benzylic alcohol, were investigated for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium (reversion of the his- strain TA98) in the presence of various xenobiotic-metabolizing systems. In the direct test, HMP was inactive and OH-CPC was very weakly active. In the presence of NADPH-fortified postmitochondrial fraction from rat liver (S9/NADPH), no activation of OH-CPC was observed, whereas strong mutagenic effects were elicited by HMP. In the presence of cytosol and 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), both alcohols were activated to potent mutagens. For equal mutagenic effects, approximately 650-fold lower concentrations of HMP were required in the cytosol/PAPS-mediated assay than in the S9/NADPH-mediated assay. The cytosol/PAPS-mediated mutagenicity of both alcohols was 3- to 4-fold enhanced, when KCl (125 mM) was present during the exposure. The authentic chloromethylarenes, 1-chloromethylpyrene and 4-chloro-4H-cyclopenta[def]chrysene, showed very strong direct mutagenicity. These results, taken together with previous findings, indicate that both primary and secondary benzylic alcohols derived from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may be activated by sulfotransferases to electrophilic sulfuric acid esters, and by subsequent substitution reaction to further active species such as benzylic chlorides., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The methanol extract from Citrus aurantium showed a suppressive effect on umu gene expression of SOS response in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 against the mutagen 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (furylfuramide). The methanol extract from C. aurantium was successively re-extracted with hexane, dichloromethane, butanol, and water. A dichloromethane fraction showed a suppressive effect. The suppressive compounds in the dichloromethane fraction were isolated by SiO(2) column chromatography and identified as tetra-O-methylscutellarein (1), sinensetin (2), and nobiletin (3) by EI-MS and (1)H- and (13)C NMR spectroscopy. These compounds suppressed the furylfuramide-induced SOS response in the umu test. Gene expression was suppressed 67%, 45%, and 25% at a concentration of 0.6 micromol/mL, respectively. The ID(50) value (50% inhibition dose) of compound 1 was 0. 19 micromol/mL. These compounds were assayed with other mutagens, 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), which requires liver metabolizing enzymes, activated Trp-P-1, and UV irradiation. These compounds showed of all mutagen-induced SOS response in the umu test. In addition, compounds 1-3 exhibited antimutagenic activity in the S. typhimurium TA100 Ames test., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The antimutagenic effects of 27 kinds of plant flavonoids on the mutagenicity of aflatoxin B1(AFB1) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine(MNNG) in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 were investigated. In the mixed applications of AFB1 (1 microgram/plate) with the flavonoids (300 micrograms/plate) in the presence of a mammalian metabolic activation system (S9 mix), chrysin, apigenin, luteolin and its glucoside, kaempferol, fisetin, morin, naringenin, hesperetin, persicogenin, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin showed the antimutagenic effect against AFB1 with more than 70% inhibition rate. A little or no antimutagenicities except flavone against MNNG (0.5 microgram/plate) were observed. For the antimutagenicity of the flavonoids on AFB1, the flavonoid structure that contains the free 5-, 7-hydroxyl group seemed to be essential. However, saturation of the 2,3-double bond or elimination of the 4-keto group did not affect the activity., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: An investigation was undertaken to determine whether analgesics and their derivatives (13 compounds), and anti-inflammatory drugs (4 compounds) had mutagenicity. Rec-assay was used to clarify specific DNA-damaging properties, and the Ames test was used to find back-mutations, using S-9 fractions obtained from the liver of 4 animal species pretreated with polychlorobiphenyl. In the Rec-assay, salicylic acid (2 mg), aspirin (5 mg), benzoic acid (4 mg), sulpyrine (0.4 mg), indomethacin (0.1 mg), oxyphenbutazone (0.1 mg) and diclofenac sodium (0.1 mg) showed a DNA-damaging tendency. In the Ames test, mutagenicity of methyl salicylate was demonstrated using the Salmonella typhimurium TA98 strain upon addition of hamster S-9 mixture. Weak mutagenicity was also found using the TA100 strain with rat S-9 mixture for salicylic acid, sulpyrine, indomethacin and oxyphenbutazone, and with hamster S-9 mixture for methyl salicylate, acetaminophen and phenacetine., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Leptolyngbya  sp. KIOST-1 (LK1) is a newly isolated cyanobacterium that shows no obvious cytotoxicity and contains high protein content for both human and animal diets. However, only limited information is available on its toxic effects. The purpose of this study was to validate the safety of LK1 powder. Following Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines, a single-dose oral toxicity test in Sprague Dawley rats was performed. Genotoxicity was assessed using a bacterial reverse mutation test with  Salmonella typhimurium  (strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537) and  Escherichia coli  WP2  uvrA , an in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration test using Chinese hamster lung cells, and an in vivo mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus test using Hsd:ICR (CD-1) SPF mouse bone marrow. After LK1 administration (2,500 mg/kg), there were no LK1-related body weight changes or necropsy findings. The reverse mutation test showed no increased reverse mutation upon exposure to 5,000 μg/plate of the LK1 powder, the maximum tested amount. The chromosome aberration test and micronucleus assay demonstrated no chromosomal abnormalities and genotoxicity, respectively, in the presence of the LK1 powder. The absence of physiological findings and genetic abnormalities suggests that LK1 powder is appropriate as a candidate biomass to be used as a safe food ingredient., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The XAD-2 resin concentration/elution system for concentration of mutagens contained in urines was optimized for cancer patients who had been administered such antineoplastic agents as adriamycin (ADR; doxorubicin), cyclophosphamide (CP), methotrexate, vincristine, and 5-fluorouracil. In the reverse mutation assay, Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535 and TA98 differentiated between CP (with S9 fraction) and ADR (without S9), respectively. No dose-response for CP was observed. There was a dose-response to ADR by TM677 in the presence of S9 using a forward mutation assay. However, while the reverse mutation assays successfully detected ADR and CP administration in the presence of each other in terms of urine mutagenicity, the forward mutation assay did not, since unidentified CP metabolites were also detected in the latter. None of these systems detected mutagenic urines from tobacco smokers, although reaction of these urines with beta-glucuronidase allowed this type of source to be detected also., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Aflatoxin B1 and some of its metabolites were released from water-soluble aflatoxin conjugates isolated from rat primary hepatocyte cultures and hydrolysed by enzymes (beta-glucuronidase and sulphatase), by acid or by a combination of both treatments. The presence of AFB1 in the hydrolysates was detected on TLC plates, or indicated indirectly by the Ames mutagenicity assay. The aflatoxin conjugates were not mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the presence of rat-liver S-9 mix. However, following enzymatic hydrolysis, the chloroform extract of the hydrolysate was highly mutagenic to the bacteria, indicating the presence of mutagenic AFB1. The conjugates AFB1-glucuronide and AFB1-sulphate are therefore produced from AFB1 in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Two oral contraceptive steroids, mestranol and norethynodrel, were evaluated for mutagenicity in the Salmonella histidine reversion assay. The pure forms of the hormones were not mutagenic when tested with either missense (TA1535, TA100) or frameshift (TA98, TA1538, TA1537) strains. In vitro activation of the hormones with liver homogenates from rats induced either with phenobarbital or Aroclor did not influence these results. However, mestranol was capable of enhancing the mutation yield obtained by an ineffective subthreshold dose of 2-acetylaminofluorene. Dimethyl sulfoxide extracts of two contraceptive pills, Ovulen-21 (containing mestranol) or Enovid-E (containing mestranol or norethynodrel), also were nonmutagenic. But again, both these extracts were capable of enhancing the mutation yield induced with an ineffective dosage of 2-acetylaminofluorene and N-nitrosopiperidine. These studies point to the possible promotional effect and subsequent potential hazard to the female consumers who use these hormones as a means of pregnancy control., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The mutagenicity and genotoxicity in bacteria of 2.3THz radiation (THz) produced by a free-electron laser (NovoFEL) were evaluated; exposures were 5, 10, or 15min at average power 1.4W/cm(2). Two Ames mutagenicity test strains of Salmonella typhimurium, TA98 and TA102, were used. For the genotoxicity test, we measured SOS induction in Escherichia coli PQ37. No significant differences were found between exposed and control cells, indicating that THz radiation is neither mutagenic nor genotoxic under these conditions. Nevertheless, a small increase in total cell number of S. typhimurium after 15min exposure, and an increase in β-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase activities in E.coli PQ37, were observed, indicating some effect of THz radiation on cell metabolism. We also examined the combined effect of 4-NQO (8μM; positive control) and THz exposure (5min) on genotoxicity in E.coli PQ37. Unexpectedly, THz radiation decreased 4-NQO genotoxicity. , Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The liquid suspension modification of the standard Salmonella mutagenicity assay employing Ames tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 and T100 was used to study the influence of potassium, sodium and calcium on the mutagenic activity of MNU and MNNG. The toxic and mutagenic activities of MNU and MNNG were better expressed when potassium-containing solution was used as a solvent. Short-term pretreatment of bacteria cells with potassium-containing solutions increased the mutagenic efficiency of both chemicals. Potassium-induced increased sensibility of S. typhimurium TA1535 to MNU was completely reversible after 20 min incubation of bacteria in a nutrient broth at 37 degrees C. The mutagenic activity of MNU was reduced after a short-term pretreatment of S. typhimurium TA1535 with a 0.9% solution of CaCl2, while NaCl did not change the mutagenic response of bacteria to MNU., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Natulan R (MIH, procarbazine) was tested for its ability to induce prophage lambda in Escherichia coli GY5027. E. coli Gy4015 served as indicator strain. A weak phage-inducing effect was observed at concentrations from 2 to 12 mg/plate in presence of S9 prepared from rats. This effect was found not to be due to the formation of hydrogen peroxide. It was confirmed that, even at the same high concentrations, no mutagenic effect can be detected with the Ames test in strains TA98 and TA100 of S. typhimurium. However, a toxic effect was observed in presence of S9 in S. typhimurium., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Several mutants with decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were isolated from the sensitive mutagen tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA100 after treatment with u.v. and selection for resistance to N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG) and its methyl analogue MNNG. Estimation of the GSH concentration and GSH S-transferase activity in extracts of these strains and of TA100 indicates that the GSH- derivatives contain 10-30% of the GSH level found in TA100, and that they exhibit normal GSH S-transferase activity. The mutagenic activities of 7 chemicals, namely, MNNG, ENNG, 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE), 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), styrene-7,8-oxide (STOX), N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) were compared in TA100 and in one representative GSH- strain, denominated NG-57. MNNG, ENNG, DBE and CDNB are potent to extremely potent mutagens in TA100, but induce very low levels of His+ mutants in NG-57. Pretreatment of NG-57 with 1 mM GSH (partially) restores the mutant yields to the levels usually found in TA100. The mutagenic activities of STOX, ENU and MMS are similar in both strains. These results support some previous findings, namely that ENNG, MNNG and DBE, but not ENU are activated to mutagens inside the test bacteria, and also suggest that CDNB is activated by bacterial GSH. The latter finding is in contrast with the current view that CDNB is detoxified by GSH, as is also presently evidenced by a strong reduction of the compound's mutagenicity in the presence of extracts of rat liver, which contains GSH and GSH S-transferase activity. The results with STOX indicate that GSH plays in bacteria a much less important role in the detoxification of xenobiotics than in mammalian tissue, presumably due to a much lower GSH S-transferase activity in the first organism., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia) is an important spice which is widely consumed in the Indian subcontinent as well as in several other parts of the world. In the present study, NMR spectroscopy showed the presence of cinnamaldehyde to be the major component of the bark. The possible mutagenic effects of cinnamon bark ethanolic extract (CEE, 0.01-1 mg/plate) cinnamon oil (CNO, 0.125-1 mg/plate), and its active component cinnamadehyde (CLD, 0.125-1 mg/plate) were evaluated. Antimutagenic activity of CEE, CNO, and CLD was also tested against various food borne mutagens (heterocyclic amines and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)) and sodium azide (SA) using Ames assay. Similarly, the antimicrobial activity was studied using agar well diffusion assay against various pathogens. CEE was non-mutagenic in any of the five tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102, and TA104) in Ames test. CEE exhibited antimutagenic activity against all the mutagens tested in the higher doses. Additionally, CEE, CNO, and CLD were effective against various pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, S. typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli in the agar well diffusion assay. Promising antimutagenic and antimicrobial properties were shown by the cinnamon bark ethanolic extract and cinnamaldehyde, respectively. Therefore, their role in cancer chemoprevention, as well as a natural antimicrobial agent must be exploited and studied in depth in in vivo conditions., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The mutagenic activity of garbage originating from a household wax industry was determined by the Salmonella/microsome assay, using the bacterial strains TA100, TA98 and YG1024. The garbage was obtained by sweeping the floor of the factory at the end of the work shift. Organic compounds were extracted by ultrasound for 30 min in dichloromethane or 70% ethanol. After evaporation of solvent, these extracts (HFS: household-wax factory sweepings) were dissolved in DMSO, and were tested for the mutagenic activity at varying concentrations (HFS-ET: 0.08-0.68 mg/plate, HFS-DCM: 0.60-7.31 mg/plate). The colouring agents (pigments) used in the production of the wax were also dissolved in DMSO and tested with the assay. The concentrations tested for each pigment were: Amaranth: 0.46-3.65 mg/plate, Auramine: 0.15-1.2 mg/plate and Rhodamine B: 0.22-1.82 mg/plate. Both ET and DCM organic extracts had mutagenic activity, especially in the YG1024 strain. The pigments behaved in a similar way, demonstrating that YG1024 was the most sensitive strain for the detection of mutagenicity, and that metabolization increased the activity. Human exposure (occupational and non-occupational) to industrial residues generated during the household-wax manufacturing and packaging process should be monitored, since this type of garbage is normally deposited in the environment without any control., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Cyracure UVR 6105 is a cycloaliphatic epoxy monomer and has both carboxylate and epoxy groups, with the potential for rapid polymerization. It is widely used in industry for the preparation of inks, resins, coatings, and was proposed for incorporation into dental composites. The objective of this study was to determine the mutagenic potential of this chemical related to its metabolite products. Several doses of Cyracure UVR 6105 were dissolved in DMSO and subjected to the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. A metabolic activation system (S9-mix) was used consisting of Arochlor-induced liver S9 homogenate enriched with NADP and glucose-6-phosphate cofactors. In contrast to studies without S9-mix, Cyracure UVR 6105 exhibited enhanced genotoxic activities with strains TA100 and TA1535 in the presence of liver S9-mix. From in vitro metabolism of Cyracure UVR 6105 with S9-mix, as used in the Ames assay, several metabolites were identified. The alcohol metabolite, 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethanol, containing intact epoxy group was identified in the organic solvent extract. This metabolite was synthesized and proved to be mutagenic against TA100 when assayed in the presence and absence of S9-mix. Results showed that the increased mutagenicity of Cyracure UVR-6105 in the presence of liver enzymes is due to the formation of the mutagenic metabolite 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethanol., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) is activated to mutagenic species in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100) by hamster hepatic S9 preparation. This S9 activity is induced by administration of ethanol to the animals. The organic solvents dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (MP) inhibit this mutagenicity, apparently because they inhibit DMN demethylase activity (assayed as formaldehyde production). Ellagic acid, dissolved in DMSO or MP, had no inhibitory effect on DMN mutagenicity, beyond the effect of the solvent vehicle., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The mutagenicities of 22 mono-nitrobenzene derivatives, i.e., nitrobenzene [98-95-3] and the ortho, meta and para isomers of nitrotoluene [88-72-2, 99-08-1, 99-99-0], nitrophenol [88-75-5, 554-84-7, 100-02-7], nitroanisole [91-23-6, 555-03-3, 100-17-4], nitrochlorobenzene [88-73-3, 121-73-3, 100-00-5], nitrobenzoic acid [552-16-9, 121-92-6, 62-23-7], nitrobenzaldehyde [552-89-6, 99-61-6, 555-16-8] and nitrobenzonitrile [612-24-8, 619-24-9, 619-72-7], were tested with or without S9 mix and norharman [244-63-3] in the Salmonella assay system. None of the compounds was mutagenic without norharman. In the presence of norharman, however, nitrobenzene, nitrotoluene, nitroanisole, nitrochlorobenzene and nitrobenzaldehyde exhibited mutagenicity only to S. typhimurium TA98 with S9 mix. This induction of mutagenesis with norharman was strong for the ortho isomers of every nitro-compound, weak for the para isomers, and was not observed for the meta isomers., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The antimutagenicity of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) prepared by refluxing D-glucose and L-tryptophan under various reaction conditions was determined by means of the Ames test. The dose of MRPs with 5 mg per plate showed no toxicity, and mutagenicity to Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 was used for antimutagenic assay. The mutagenicity of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo (4,5-f) quinoline (IQ) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido (1,2-a:3',2'-d) imidazole (Glu-P-1) toward TA98 was markedly reduced by the addition of glucose-tryptophan MRPs, whereas the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (NQNO) was not inhibited. The mutagenicity of IQ, Glu-P-1, and NQNO toward TA100 was also markedly reduced by glucose-tryptophan MRPs, but the mutagenicity of NQNO was only slightly inhibited. Greater antimutagenic effects of glucose-tryptophan MRPs were found when these materials were prepared at an alkaline pH. The optimum combinations of reaction conditions for obtaining antimutagenic MRPs to IQ were glucose-tryptophan molar ratio = 0.5:0.25 at pH 9.0 for 5 and 10 h, molar ratio = 0.5:0.5 at pH 11.0 for 10 h, and molar ratio = 1.0:0.25 at pH 7.0 for 15 h and at pH 11.0 for 15 h. The antimutagenic effect of glucose-tryptophan MRPs to IQ and Glu-P-1 was well correlated with their browning intensity, reducing power, and antioxidative activity. The antimutagenicity of glucose-tryptophan MRPs might be due to both desmutagenic and bio-antimutagenic effects., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The mutagenic activity of methanol extracts from airconditioner filters was tested using the standard plate-incorporation procedure for the Ames test and the strains Salmonella typhimurium TA97, TA98 and TA100 as test organisms. In a first set of experiments filters from 4 buildings were investigated. For each building the mutagenic activity of a filter which was in use during the fire (fire-exposed) was compared with the mutagenic activity of a filter which was exposed for a similar time span to normal urban air (non-exposed). While for 1 pair of filters the non-exposed extract was more mutagenic than the fire-exposed material, the opposite was found for 2 other filter pairs, and in 1 case there was hardly any difference in the mutagenic activities of the fire-exposed and the non-exposed filter extracts. Overall differences by factors up to 100 were observed in the mutants/m3 air values of the most and the least mutagenic filter extracts. The second group of experiments was performed to investigate the variations in mutagenic activity of filter extracts occurring due to changes in the weather conditions. Airborne particles were collected for 3 consecutive periods of 10-11 days at the 2 buildings where the extracts of the fire-exposed filters had been found to be more mutagenic than the corresponding control materials. The differences between the strongest and the weakest mutagenic filter extracts of these series were similar to the differences observed previously between the fire-exposed filters and the non-exposed filter materials. The highest mutagenic activities found in the second group of experiments was similar, at both sites, to the mutagenic activities measured in the fire-exposed extracts from these 2 buildings. Since the differences in the mutagenic activities of filters exposed to urban air during the different meteorological conditions were similar to the differences observed between fire-exposed and non-exposed materials, it is not possible to state whether the fire led to the distribution of mutagenic chemicals, although it is theoretically possible. However, based on the observation that the maximal mutagenic activities of the fire-exposed and the non-exposed extracts were similar, the present study allows the conclusion that the mutagenic burden for the population of the area of Basel was not significantly increased by the fire in Schweizerhalle on November 1, 1986., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: In the present study, the acute, subacute and genetic toxicity of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in the form of Bio-Quinone (Pharma Nord, Denmark) was assessed. LD(50) of CoQ10 by oral treatment was greater than 20g/kg body weight in both female and male mice. Genotoxicity was assessed in mice by Ames test in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102, by bone marrow micronucleus test and sperm abnormality. Thirty-day subacute toxicity was conducted with oral daily dose at 0, 0.56, 1.13 and 2.25g/kg body weight in rats. No significant changes in body weight, food intake, behavior, mortality, hematology, blood biochemistry, vital organ weight, sperm abnormality, mutagenicity and micronucleus formation were observed and no clinical signs or adverse effects were detected by administration of CoQ10. These results support the safety of CoQ10 for oral consumption., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Hepatic S9 preparations from Aroclor 1254 induced rats and 3-methylcholanthrene induced woodchucks were used to investigate, in vitro, the mutagenic potential of five amino acid conjugates of 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (alanine, aspartic acid, leucine, methionine and tryptophan). Five strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA97, TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1538) were utilized for this purpose. Dose-response effects producing a two-fold increase of revertants over spontaneous levels were not observed with either S9 preparation indicating that the amino acid conjugates are not promutagens in these assays., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Synthetic dyes are released in wastewater from textile manufacturing plants, and many of these dyes are genotoxic. In the present study, the mutagenicity of azo, anthraquinone, and triphenyl methane dyes was investigated before and after successive biodegradation with activated sludge and the ligninolytic fungus, Irpex lacteus. Two biodegradation systems were used to reduce the genotoxicity of dyes that were not efficiently inactivated by activated sludge alone. Mutagenicity was monitored with the Salmonella reversion assay conducted with the base-pair substitution detector strains, TA100 and YG1042, and the frame-shift detector strains, TA98 and YG1041, with and without rat liver S9. All dyes except for Congo Red (CR) were mutagenic with S9 activation. Assays conducted with the dyes indicated that only the azo dye Reactive Orange 16 (RO16) was mutagenic in both TA98 and TA100. Methyl Red and Disperse Blue 3 (DB3) were mutagenic in TA98, YG1041 and YG1042, while Reactive Black 5 was mutagenic in YG1041 and YG1042. Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR), Crystal violet (CV) and Bromophenol Blue (BPB) were mutagenic only in TA98, but the toxicity of the latter two dyes complicated the evaluation of their mutagenicity. CR was not mutagenic in any of the tester strains. Biodegradation studies conducted with RO16 and DB3 indicated that the two-step biodegradation process reduced the mutagenic potential of RO16 and DB3 to a greater extent than activated sludge alone; the mutagenicity of the two dyes was reduced by 95.2% and 77.8%, respectively, by the two-step process. These data indicate that the combined biodegradation process may be useful for reducing the mutagenicity associated with wastewater from textile factories that contain recalcitrant dyes., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Purple rice (Oryza sativa L. var. indica) cv. Kum Doisaket is cultivated in northern Thailand. This study evaluated the mutagenic and antimutagenic properties of hydrophilic and lipophilic components of purple rice using the Ames test. The seed and hull of purple rice were extracted with hexane, methanol, ethanol, and water. The methanol extracts had the highest amounts of phenolic acids and flavonoids, while the hexane extracts contained large amount of tocols and γ-oryzanol. None of the extracts were mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. The hexane extract of rice hull and the methanol extract of rice seed were strongly effective against aflatoxin B1- and 2-amino-3, 4 dimethylimidazo (4, 5-f) quinoline-induced mutagenesis, while aqueous extracts showed weakly antimutagenic properties. All extracts with the exception of aqueous extracts enhanced the number of revertant colonies from benzo (a) pyrene induced-mutagenesis. None of the extracts inhibited mutagenesis induced by the direct mutagens 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-acrylamide and sodium azide. The hull extracts showed more potent antimutagenicity than the seed extracts. Based on a chemical analysis, γ-oryzanol and γ-tocotrienol in the hull and cyanidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside in the seed are candidate antimutagens in purple rice. The antimutagenic mechanisms of purple rice might be related to either modulation of mutagen metabolizing enzymes or direct attack on electrophiles. These findings supported the use of Thai purple rice as a cancer chemopreventive agent. , Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Mutagenicity of a commercially available N-nitrosodiethanolamine (NDELA) and purified NDELA was examined, using Salmonella typhimurium TA100 as a tester strain. Purified NDELA was positive in the presence of liver activation system from either rats or hamsters, but the mutagenicity was completely lost when dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as a solvent. In contrast, the commercial NDELA which was chemically of 93.8% purity showed positive mutagenicity without metabolic activation, and the liver activation system and DMSO had no effect on the direct mutagenic activity. These results indicate that an apparent discrepancy among previous findings of several investigators with the mutagenic response of NDELA might be due to an impurity in NDELA samples and the solvent, DMSO., Yes: 0.32, No: 0.68\n",
            "Question: Benzothiazole and benzothiazole derivatives (BTs) have been detected in various environmental matrices as well as in human beings, but little is currently available regarding their toxicities. In our study, genotoxicities of nine BTs (benzothiazole [BT], 2-chlorobenzothiazole [CBT], 2-bromobenzothiazole [BrBT], 2-fluorobenzothiazole [FBT], 2-methylbenzothiazole [MeBT], 2-mercaptobenzothiazole [MBT], 2-aminobenzothiazole [ABT], 2-hydroxy-benzothiazole [OHBT] and 2-methythiobenzothiazole [MTBT]) are comprehensively evaluated by the SOS/umu test using the bacterial Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 for DNA-damaging effect and the high content in vitro micronucleus test using two human carcinoma cells (MGC-803 and A549) for chromosome-damaging effect. The cytotoxicity of BTs on both bacteria and two human cells was also evaluated. Except for the cytotoxic effect of MBT on MGC-803 and A549, the other tested BTs showed more than 50% cytotoxicity at their highest concentrations in a dose-dependent manner, and their LC50s ranged from 19 (MBT in bacteria) to 270 mg l(-1) (CBT in A549). Activation and inactivation were observed for specific BTs after metabolism. On the other hand, no evidence of genotoxicity was obtained for BT, FBT and MBT, and DNA damage was induced by ABT, OHBT, BrBT and MTBT in MGC-803, by MeBT in A549 and by CBT in both cells. Through quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis, two structure alerts for chemical genotoxicity, including heterocyclic amine and hacceptor-path3-hacceptor are present in ABT and OHBT respectively; however, the underlying mechanisms still need further evaluation., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",

It is widely used in industry for the preparation of inks, resins, coatings, and was proposed for incorporation into dental composites. The objective of this study was to determine the mutagenic potential of this chemical related to its metabolite products. Several doses of Cyracure UVR 6105 were dissolved in DMSO and subjected to the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. A metabolic activation system (S9-mix) was used consisting of Arochlor-induced liver S9 homogenate enriched with NADP and glucose-6-phosphate cofactors. In contrast to studies without S9-mix, Cyracure UVR 6105 exhibited enhanced genotoxic activities with strains TA100 and TA1535 in the presence of liver S9-mix. From in vitro metabolism of Cyracure UVR 6105 with S9-mix, as used in the Ames assay, several metabolites were identified. The alcohol metabolite, 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethanol, containing intact epoxy group was identified in the organic solvent extract. This metabolite was synthesized and proved to be mutagenic against TA100 when assayed in the presence and absence of S9-mix. Results showed that the increased mutagenicity of Cyracure UVR-6105 in the presence of liver enzymes is due to the formation of the mutagenic metabolite 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethanol., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: A synthetic muramyl dipeptide derivative N2-[(N-acetylmuramoyl)-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl]-N6-stearoyl-L-lysine (MDP-Lys(L18), muroctasin) was studied for mutagenicity using the Ames method, in vitro cytogenetics and micronucleus test. MDP-Lys(L18) had no mutagenic effect on S. typhimurium (TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98 and TA100) or E. coli (WP2 uvrA) in the reverse mutation assay. In the cytogenetic study, MDP-Lys(L18) had no effect on the chromosomes of the Chinese hamster cells at cytotoxic doses. Single subcutaneous treatment of MDP-Lys(L18) at dose levels of 3.5, 35 or 350 mg/kg in the mouse micronucleus test did not increase the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes. These results show that MDP-Lys(L18) has no demonstrable mutagenic potential., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Dichloromethane and 90% methanol extracts of 42 South African plants were screened for mutagenicity and antimutagenicity using the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay (Ames) against Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 bacterial strains in the presence and absence of metabolic activator S9. The methanol extracts from whole plants of Helichrysum simillimum, Helichrysum herbaceum and Helichrysum rugulosum indicated mutagenicity. These are the first reported tests on the mutagenicity of Helichrysum species. Six species indicated antimutagenic properties, all in the presence of S9: methanol leaf extract of Bauhinia galpinii, and dichloromethane leaf extracts of Bauhinia galpinii, Clerodendrum myricoides, Datura stramonium, Buddleja saligna, Millettia sutherlandii and Sutherlandia frutescens., Yes: 0.97, No: 0.03\n",
            "Question: Reconstituted non-fat dry milk powder, fermented by a mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus CH3 and Lactobacillus bulgaricus 191R to produce yogurt, was freeze-dried and extracted in acetone. After evaporation of the acetone, the extract was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and tested for antimutagenicity. In the Ames test, significant dose-dependent activity was observed against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), 4-nitro-quinoline-N-oxide (4NQO), 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB), 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benz[a]anthracene (DMBA), and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole acetate (Trp-P-2). Weak activity was observed against 1,2,7,8-diepoxyoctane (DEO), and no activity was observed against methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), or aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). In a related assay (Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7), significant antimutagenic activity was detected against MNNG and 4NQO. Activity against the experimental colon carcinogens MNNG and DMAB was examined further, as assayed in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA100). Compounds responsible for both activities were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in DMSO. Adjustment of yogurt pH to 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the amount of anti-MNNG activity recovered. In contrast, extractability of anti-DMAB activity was significantly greater at acidic pH. Conjugated linoleic acid, a known dairy anticarcinogen, failed to inhibit mutagenesis caused by either mutagen, suggesting that other yogurt-derived compound(s) are responsible. Unfermented milk was treated with lactic acid, yogurt bacteria without subsequent growth, or both, to determine if formation of antimutagenic activity required bacterial growth. Extracts of the milk treatments exhibited the same weak antimutagenicity observed in unfermented milk, approximately 2.5-fold less than in the yogurt extracts, suggesting that antimutagenic activity is associated with bacterial growth., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: DNA alkylating agents such as 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (SDMH) and azoxymethane (AOM) are potent carcinogens and are widely used to induce colon tumors in experimental animals. However, standard bacterial mutagenesis assays have failed to detect the mutagenic effects of these chemicals. Using derivatives of a set of Escherichia coli test strains developed by Cupples and Miller (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86, 5345, 1989), we hve demonstrated that under two conditions, SDMH and AOM induced point mutations by several-fold in a dose-dependent manner: (i) of six possible base substitutions, they only induced GC-->AT transitions; and (ii) the cells must be deficient in O6-methylguanine (O6MeG) DNA methyltransferase (MTase) activity. SDMH and AOM up to 200 microg/ml were unable to induce His+ revertants in a Salmonella Ames test strain TA1535 (GC-->AT); however, in the absence of mammalian S9 extract, His+ revertants increased up to 55-fold upon treatment of an isogenic Salmonella strain deficient in MTase activity. These results indicate that SDMH and AOM are indeed bacterial mutagens and that lesions induced by them are the target of DNA repair MTases, which probably include mutagenic and carcinogenic lesions such as O6MeG. Furthermore, variable responses of bacterial species to SDMH- and AOM-induced mutagenicity suggests a difference either in the metabolism of potential mutagens or in the repair of specific lesions. Since O6MeG is not only a mutagenic lesion but also a lethal lesion if left unrepaired, we compared the mutagenicity and toxicity of SDMH and AOM with an SN-type methylating carcinogen. N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, and conclude that SDMH and AOM are weak bacterial mutagens., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Tea is consumed worldwide as second largest to water in popularity as a beverage. It has been reported that tea extracts have antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidative, antitumor and antimutagenic activities. The protective effect of green tea has been assumed to be due to the powerful scavenging and antioxidative property of high concentrations of unpolymerised catechins and their gallates. In the present proposal green tea extract (GT), (+)-catechin (C) and (-)-epicatechin (EC) were investigated for their antioxidant activity by different in vitro methods like (i) DPPH assay (ii) superoxide anion scavenging and (iii) hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity. Further these agents were also tested against mutagenesis using the well-standardized Ames microsomal test system. The Ames tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA102, which readily responds to reactive oxygen species, was used and the antimutagenic activity was evaluated against oxidative mutagens tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (ID50-24.41, 29.63 and 113.23 microg for EC, C and GT, respectively) and hydrogen peroxide (ID50-17.3, 18.4 and 88.1 microg for EC, C and GT, respectively). Ascorbic acid was used as a standard antioxidant in all the experiments. Results indicate that all the three agents possess excellent DPPH free radical scavenging activity (IC50-1.5 microg for EC, 3.45 microg for C and 3.8 microg for GT), good hydrogen peroxide (IC50-11.18 microg for EC, 13.5 microg for C and 11.78 microg for GT) and superoxide anion scavenging (IC50-1.64 microg for EC, 1.74 microg for C and 3.52 microg for GT) activities. Further, they also show antimutagenic activity in the above-mentioned test systems establishing their antioxidant nature to be responsible for such activity. The in vitro antioxidant activity correlates well with the antimutagenic action. (-)-Epicatechin is indicated to be a better agent in comparison to the other two agents (ID50-1.2 times more than C and 5 times more than GT in antimutagenicity studies against t-BOOH and hydrogen peroxide induced mutagenesis). Ascorbic acid however showed a much less activity (ID50-12.1 mg against t-BOOH and 7.2 mg with hydrogen peroxide induced mutagenesis)., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The antimutagenic properties of the most prevalent flavonoids in rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) were compared in the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay using tester strains TA98 and TA100 with, respectively, 2-acetamido-fluorene (2-AAF) and aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) as mutagens in the presence of metabolic activation. The flavonoids included the dihydrochalcones aspalathin and nothofagin and their flavone analogues, orientin and isoorientin, and vitexin and isovitexin, respectively, as well as luteolin, chrysoeriol, (+)-catechin, quercetin, isoquercitrin, hyperoside and rutin. Flavonoid-mutagen interactions ranged from antimutagenic, comutagenic and promutagenic to mutagenic, while dose-response effects were mutagen-specific and ranged from typical to atypical including biphasic and threshold effects. Aspalathin and nothofagin and their structural flavonoid analogues displayed moderate antimutagenic properties while luteolin and to some extent, chrysoeriol, showed activities comparable to those of the green tea flavonoid (-) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Apart from their mutagenic and promutagenic properties, quercetin and isoquercitrin exhibited concentration-dependent comutagenic and/or antimutagenic effects against 2-AAF- and AFB(1)-induced mutagenesis. Different structural parameters known to affect the antimutagenic properties of flavonoids include their hydrophilic or lipophilic nature due to the extent of hydroxylation and O-methylation, glycosylation on the A and B rings, the C4-keto group and the C2-C3 double bond. The C ring does not appear to be a prerequisite when comparing for the antimutagenic activity of the dihydrochalcones when compared of the dihydrochalcones with the structural flavone analogues., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: 1,8-Dinitropyrene (DNP) is a potent, direct-acting mutagen to Salmonella typhimurium TA98 due to activation by bacterial metabolism. We have studied the effects of uninduced and Aroclor-induced rodent liver post-mitochondrial supernatant (S9), microsomes or cytosolic preparations on its activity. With the plate incorporation protocol, the reported S9-mediated inhibition of mutagenicity was confirmed and shown to be greater after induction when equivalent levels of protein were plated. Cytosol increased mutagenicity considerably whereas the inhibitory effect of S9 could be attributed to the microsomal fraction. The activating and detoxifying capacities of the various hepatic fractions derived from male Sprague-Dawley rats and female BALB/c mice were similar. In the absence of hepatic preparations, DNP mutagenicity was much lower in TA98/1,8DNP6 (deficient in transacetylase) than in TA98, although mutagenic activity could be still increased in the former strain by addition of uninduced cytosol. When DNP was pre-incubated in a liquid assay with S9 before addition of TA98, inhibition occurred and was time dependent. Thus the overall detoxifying effect of S9 is independent of bacterial metabolism. Furthermore, inhibition occurred under conditions where cytosol and microsomal components of S9 were kept together, indicating that the detoxifying effect of the microsomes predominates. The data therefore suggest that the microsomal-mediated detoxification by S9 may be due to the presence of an inhibitory component, enzymatic or otherwise, whose concentration is increased after Aroclor-induction. Nitro-reductase activities detected in TA98 and TA98/1,8-DNP6 were 10-fold higher than those in the mammalian fractions, although the activities in the latter increased to the bacterial enzyme levels after incubation of induced S9 or microsomes, but not cytosol, with an NADPH-generating system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS), Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Chalcones present several biological activities and sulfonamide chalcone derivatives have shown important biological applications, including antitumor activity. In this study, genotoxic, cytotoxic, antigenotoxic, and anticytotoxic activities of the sulfonamide chalcone N-{4-[3-(4-nitrophenyl)prop-2-enoyl]phenyl} benzenesulfonamide (CPN) were assessed using the Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation test (Ames test) and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. The results showed that CPN caused a small increase in the number of histidine revertant colonies in S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100, but not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The antimutagenicity test showed that CPN significantly decreased the number of His+ revertants in strain TA98 at all doses tested (p < 0.05), whereas in strain TA100 this occurred only at doses higher than 50 μg/plate (p < 0.05). The results of the micronucleus test indicated that CPN significantly increased the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE) at 24 h and 48 h, revealing a genotoxic effect of this compound. Also, a significant decrease in polychromatic/normochromatic erythrocyte ratio (PCE/NCE) was observed at the higher doses of CPN at 24 h and 48 h (p < 0.05), indicating its cytotoxic action. CPN co-administered with mitomycin C (MMC) significantly decreased the frequency of MNPCE at almost all doses tested at 24 h (p < 0.05), showing its antigenotoxic activity, and also presented a small decrease in MNPCE at 48 h (p > 0.05). Additionally, CPN co-administered with MMC significantly increased PCE/NCE ratio at all doses tested, demonstrating its anticytotoxic effect. In summary, CPN presented genotoxic, cytotoxic, antigenotoxic, and anticytotoxic properties. , Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: The mutagenicities of 22 mono-nitrobenzene derivatives, i.e., nitrobenzene [98-95-3] and the ortho, meta and para isomers of nitrotoluene [88-72-2, 99-08-1, 99-99-0], nitrophenol [88-75-5, 554-84-7, 100-02-7], nitroanisole [91-23-6, 555-03-3, 100-17-4], nitrochlorobenzene [88-73-3, 121-73-3, 100-00-5], nitrobenzoic acid [552-16-9, 121-92-6, 62-23-7], nitrobenzaldehyde [552-89-6, 99-61-6, 555-16-8] and nitrobenzonitrile [612-24-8, 619-24-9, 619-72-7], were tested with or without S9 mix and norharman [244-63-3] in the Salmonella assay system. None of the compounds was mutagenic without norharman. In the presence of norharman, however, nitrobenzene, nitrotoluene, nitroanisole, nitrochlorobenzene and nitrobenzaldehyde exhibited mutagenicity only to S. typhimurium TA98 with S9 mix. This induction of mutagenesis with norharman was strong for the ortho isomers of every nitro-compound, weak for the para isomers, and was not observed for the meta isomers., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The nitrosating agent tetranitromethane (TNM) and the nitrosation product 3-nitro-L-tyrosine (NT) were tested for mutagenic activity in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome assay. TNM showed strong genotoxic activity: it was mutagenic in all tester strains used (TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA102). The maximum mutagenic activity was reached between 16 and 32 micrograms/plate using the standard plate test; higher amounts led to distinct bactericidal effects. The mutagenicity was independent of an in vitro activation system. In the preincubation assay an increased bactericidal effect was observed. In contrast to TNM, NT, the nitrosation product, was non-mutagenic and non-toxic in the standard plate test and with the preincubation method up to 5000 micrograms/plate with and without S9 mix and with all tester strains used. Although TNM is a strong direct-acting mutagen, its nitrosating effect on proteins does lead to nongenotoxic nitro products of tyrosine in proteins., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Using an ion-exchange procedure coupled to a microsuspension Salmonella assay, we fractionated the dichloromethane-extractable particulate organics emitted by a municipal waste incinerator. Most (80-95%) of the mutagenic activity resided in the neutral/base fraction; however, the polar neutral fraction accounted for 12% of the direct-acting mutagenic activity. The mutagenic potencies of the whole extract and the various fractions were 4-15 times greater in the absence than in the presence of S9. Results with strains deficient in classical nitroreductase (TA98NR) and transacetylase (TA98/1,8-DNP6) indicated that a majority of the direct-acting mutagenicity was due to nitroarenes. This was confirmed by bioassay-directed subfractionation of the neutral/base faction by a cyanopropyl/HPLC method. The mutations in -3,000 revertants (approximately 400 each induced in TA98 by the whole extract, the neutral/base and polar neutral fractions from the ion-exchange column and 3 of the neural/base subfractions from the HPLC column; along with 200 revertants each induced by the model nitroarene 1-nitropyrene (1NP) in strains TA98, TA1538 and TA100) were analyzed by probe hybridization and PCR/DNA sequence analysis. The results indicated that nitroarenes such as 1NP that eluted in the neutral/base fraction accounted for at least 50% of the direct-acting mutagenicity and induced only a hotspot 2-base deletion in the sequence (CG)4 in TA98. In contrast, most of the complex frameshifts (a frameshift with a flanking base substitution) induced by the whole extract were induced by nitroarenes other than 1NP that were activated by transacetylation and that eluted in the polar neutral fraction. This study (1) identifies nitroarenes as an important contributor to the mutagenic activity of the emissions from municipal waste incinerators; (2) confirms our previous conclusion that the mutation spectrum of a complex mixture reflects the dominance of particular classes of chemical mutagens within the mixture; and (3) demonstrates the possibility of isolating certain chemical fractions of a complex mixture that induce certain classes of mutations produced by the whole, unfractionated mixture., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) has been reported to decrease genotoxicity induced by several mutagens. In this paper, the desmutagenic effect of NAC on a complex mixture, such as diesel extract, has been analyzed. Studies have been carried out in vitro with the Ames test (reverse mutations on TA98, TA100, and TA104 strains) and sister chromatid exchanges assay (SCE) in human lymphocytes. NAC inhibits diesel genotoxicity in both assays. NAC also inhibits the mutagenicity of 1,8-dinitropyrene (1,8-DNP) and 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) known to be present in diesel exhaust and to be activated by cellular O-transacetylases and nitropyrene reductases. NAC inhibits also the induction of SCE in human lymphocytes by diesel extract. These results, and those obtained by the preincubation of NAC with cells, suggest that the inhibition also takes place inside the cell., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The effects of dietary administration of diallyl sulfide (DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS) and allyl mercaptan (AM) on the genotoxicity of different chemicals were studied in two experimental systems: (i) measurement of hepatic DNA single-strand breaks induced in rats by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) or methylnitrosourea (MNU); (ii) mutagenicity of AFB1 or NDMA on Salmonella typhimurium TA100 using hepatic S9 from rats fed allyl sulfides as the activation system. All compounds strongly reduced hepatic DNA breaks induced by AFB1 and NDMA but did not modify the genotoxicity of MNU. In the Ames test, the mutagenicity of NDMA was strongly inhibited by hepatic S9 from rats fed either compound. The mutagenicity of AFB1 was also reduced but to a lesser extent. Such effects are likely related to the modulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes which play a key role in metabolic activation as well as detoxication of NDMA and AFB1., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Flavonoids such as quercetin and its glucosides, especially isoquercitrin are well known as anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, and anti-carcinogenic, etc. The safety of isoquercitrin formulations needs to be established prior to their use in functional food applications. The mutagenicity and genotoxicity of the IQC-γCD inclusion complex were assessed with three standard assays of the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) and using a combined in-vivo micronucleus and comet assay under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines. In combined rat bone marrow micronucleus and rat liver comet assay performed in male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, the various doses of IQC-γCD inclusion complex (max. 2000 mg/kg bw) and positive controls ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and mitomycin C (MMC), respectively, and negative control (vehicle) were administrated. The results of the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay (strains TA100, TA1535, WP2uvrA, TA98, and TA1537) after exposure to the IQC-γCD inclusion complex with the absence and presence of the metabolic activation system (S9 fraction from rat liver) revealed a weakly positive response but with no biologically relevant mutagenicity at the conditions examined according to recommended regulatory guidelines. The combined micronucleus and comet assay results reveal that the IQC-γCD inclusion complex did not induce in-vivo genotoxic potential or indication of any oxidative DNA damage in rat liver tissues. Altogether, considering the results of the study, it is unlikely that the consumption of IQC-γCD inclusion complex as food or supplement would present any concern for humans regarding the mutagenicity and genotoxicity., Yes: 0.0, No: 1.0\n",
            "Question: Solutions of 2-deoxy-D-ribose and D-ribose were gamma-irradiated under different experimental conditions and tested for mutagenicity, with and without preincubation, in Salmonella typhimurium. The irradiated sugar solutions were mutagenic in the tester strains TA100 and TA98. Except for malonaldehyde (MDA), which is not mutagenic in the concentrations produced radiolytically, the relative mutagenicities of the individual radiolytic products are unknown. With irradiated solutions of 2-deoxy-D-ribose, a relationship was found between the level of non-MDA aldehydes and the mutagenicity in TA100. Heating the irradiated solutions of 2-deoxy-D-ribose resulted in a temperature-dependent reduction of the mutagenicity. Autoclaved, non-irradiated solutions of 2-deoxy-D-ribose were not mutagenic in the Salmonella test., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Molds of the genus Alternaria are common food pathogens responsible for the spoilage of fruits, vegetables, grains, and nuts. Although consumption of Alternaria alternata-contaminated foodstuffs has been implicated in an elevated incidence of esophageal carcinogenesis, the mutagenic potencies of several A. alternata toxins seem unable to account for the levels of activity found using crude mycelial extracts. In this study, the mutagenic effects of nitrosylation were examined with the major Alternaria metabolites Altenuene (ALT), Alternariol (AOH), Alternariol Monomethyl Ether (AME), Altertoxin I (ATX I), Tentoxin (TENT), Tenuazonic Acid (TA), and Radicinin (RAD) using the Ames Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100. In the absence of nitrosylation, ATX I was mutagenic when tested from 1 to 100 microg/plate in TA98 with rat liver S9 for activation, while AOH and ATX I were weakly mutagenic +/- S9 in TA100. Incubation with nitrite generally increased mutagenic potencies with ATX I strongly mutagenic +/- S9 in both TA98 and TA100, while ALT, AOH, AME, and RAD responses were enhanced in TA100 + S9. However, subsequent examination of three extracts made from A. alternata culture broth, acetone-washed mycelia, and the acetone washes showed a different mutagenic response with both broth and acetone washes directly mutagenic in TA98 and TA100 but with a reduced response + S9. The acetone-washed mycelial extract was found to have the lowest mutagenic activity of the three extracts tested. Nitrosylation had little effect on the mutagenicity of any of the extracts. Thus, while nitrosylation increases the mutagenicity of ATX I, and to a lesser extent that of several other Alternaria toxins, the results demonstrate that Alternaria produces a major mutagenic activity with a S. typhimurium response different from that found with the purified toxins. Efforts are currently underway to chemically identify this mutagenic species. Published 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: Davilla nitida and Davilla elliptica (Dilleniaceae) are plants that occur predominantly in the cerrado region of South America. They are used in popular medicine to treat stomach diseases, diarrhea and swelling, particularly of the lymph nodes and testicles. Chemical investigation of these two plant species led to the identification of the compounds myricetin-3-O-α-l-rhamnoside (myricitrin), quercetin-3-O-α-l-rhamnoside (quercitrin), myricetin, quercetin and gallic acid derivatives in the leaves of D. nitida and D. elliptica. Therefore, it was concluded that the two species of Davilla possess qualitatively similar chemical profiles. In the present study, the mutagenic and genotoxic potential of these plants and of their isolated compounds was tested in the Salmonella typhimurium assay (Ames test) with strains TA100, TA98, TA102 and TA97a, in the micronucleus test with peripheral blood cells of mice treated in vivo, and in plasmid DNA to analyze DNA strand-breaks. In the assessment of mutagenic potential by the Ames test, extracts from both plant species and a D. nitida ethyl-acetate fraction induced positive responses. On the other hand, none of the extracts showed genotoxic activity in the mouse cells. In the presence of metal ion, D. nitida and D. elliptica aqueous and ethyl-acetate fractions, as well as their isolated compounds, induced single- and double-strand-breaks in plasmid DNA in a cell-free system., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: The correlation of bacterial mutagenicity with DNA adducts from the heterocyclic amine cooked-food mutagen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) was investigated in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 (uvrB deficient) and TA1978 (uvrB proficient). Bacterial cells were exposed to PhIP using a modification of the Ames/Salmonella microsuspension assay. Half of the cells, generated from a 90 min pre-incubation and washing, were plated for revertant formation while the remaining half was subjected to DNA adduct analysis via 32P-postlabeling. In TA98, DNA adducts were detected at an RAL (relative adduct labeling) of 10 x 10(-7) and 21 x 10(-7) at PhIP concentrations of 5.5 and 17 microM, respectively. This corresponded to 28.8 and 20.9 adducts/revertant, respectively. These values were based on the assumption that only four repeating GC bases within a 75 DNA base region is the gene target site for PhIP induced mutations. In TA1978, no revertants above background were detected at any concentration of PhIP tested. DNA adducts, however, were detected at 11 x 10(-7) and 21 x 10(-7) adducts per nucleotide at 223 and 1116 microM PhIP, respectively. The lack of detectable revertants, but the presence of DNA adducts, suggests pre-mutational lesions did occur during the 90 min pre-incubation. Presumably, when the S9 activating system and PhIP were removed (via washing with phosphate buffered saline) prior to plating, the cells containing an intact uvrB repair system repaired the lesions during the incubation time on the plates. In conclusion, the induction of revertants by adducts appears quite efficient, as approximately 25 adducts are required for one mutational event in the excision repair deficient bacteria., Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n",
            "Question: We performed three types of studies to evaluate the genotoxicity of the chlorinated organic solvent perchloroethylene (PERC or tetrachloroethylene) and its volatile metabolites, trichloroacetyl chloride (TCAC) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA), as well as the volatile metabolites of trichloroethylene, i.e. dichloroacetyl chloride (DCAC), dichloroacetic acid (DCA), and 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (TCE). In the first set of studies, which involved the evaluation of these chemicals in the Microscreen prophage-induction assay, only DCA (+S9) was genotoxic, producing 6.6-7.2 plaque-forming units/mM. This places DCA among the weakest of the > 100 chemicals that have been identified previously as inducers of prophage in this assay. In the second set of studies, which involved the evaluation of these chemicals in the vapor state in Salmonella TA100 using a Tedlar bag vaporization technique, DCA (+/-S9), DCAC (-S9), and TCAC (+/-S9) were mutagenic, producing 3-5x increases in revertants/plate relative to the background. S9 enhanced the mutagenic potency of DCA but had no effect on the mutagenic potency of TCAC. The potencies ranged from 0.7 to 3.9 rev/p.p.m., resulting in a potency ranking of DCA > DCAC approximately TCAC. The lowest effective concentrations were 50-300 p.p.m., which are similar to those for ethylene oxide and epichlorohydrin in this assay. In the third set of studies, the mutation spectra of DCA, DCAC, and TCAC were determined at the base-substitution allele hisG46 of Salmonella TA100. DCA and DCAC induced primarily G.C-->A.T transitions, whereas TCAC induced primarily G.C-->T.A transversions, which was also the predominant mutation among the background revertants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS), Yes: 1.0, No: 0.0\n"
