0,"Cancer is one of the most diagnosed and life threatening disease throughout the world. Nevertheless present day clinical management for cancers are surgery, radiations which are insufficient to contain the disease burden. In the past two decades, more than half of chemotherapeutic drugs developed are either directly or indirectly dependent on medicinal base phytocompounds or their derivative. The present study aims to provide the base for chemotherapeutic phytochemicals. Fagonia indica showed significant antimutagenic potential with reference to control IC 50  values were calculated as 146.33±5.2μg/ml, TA100 (AZS) 105.33±4.0μg/ml, TA98 (2AA) 113.6±5.2μg/ml followed and TA98 (AZS) 112.6±4.4 in Ames test. For this reason, the antiproliferation effect of extracts on cancer cell lines was studied through resazurin fluorescence. On HepG-2 cell lines 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) of (FIWM) was recorded as 128.3±,2.43μg/ml. On the homo sapiens epithelial cell of lung tissue (A549), the high throughput instrumental analysis of Fagonia indica depicts maximum cytotoxic effect in 30hr. The electrical impedance displays the real-time evidence about qualitative apoptosis expressed. The impedance results were supported as palmitic acid from Fagonia indica virtually that inhibits Cyclin Dependent Kinase 2 (CDKs 2) in silico molecular docking studies. Fagonia indica extract possesses substantial antimutagenic, cytotoxic and anticancer activity which supports the potential of its phytochemicals for drug development.",Is AZS mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1,"The genotoxicity of melamine was evaluated with the combined Pig-a mutation/micronucleus assay, the bacterial reverse mutation assay, and the in vitro cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN). Five groups of six- to eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were given three daily doses of vehicle control (100% pure sesame oil), melamine (500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg) or positive control (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, ENU, 20 mg/kg) by oral gavage. Peripheral blood was sampled pre-dose (day -1) and at time points up to day 60. Pig-a mutant frequencies were determined in total red blood cells (RBCs) and reticulocytes (RETs) as RBC(CD59-) and RET(CD59-) frequencies, on days -1, 15, 29 and 60, and micronucleus frequencies were measured in RETs on day 4. No significant increases in RBC(CD59-) or RET(CD59-) frequencies were observed for the melamine-treated group at any of the time points studied, but the positive control, ENU, induced statistically significant increases compared with the vehicle control. Similar results were obtained in the micronucleus assay. Melamine did not induce statistically significant increases in %MN-RET. In the bacterial reverse mutation assay, melamine was tested from 62.5 to 1000 μg/plate in tester strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102, and TA1535, with and without metabolic activation, and no evidence of toxicity or mutagenicity was observed at any dose tested. In the in vitro CBMN assay, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, melamine was tested (75, 150, and 300 μg/mL) in the presence and absence of S9 mix, and no positive increases in the number of cells containing micronuclei were seen. These results suggest that melamine does not exhibit significant genotoxic potential. These data could be valuable for risk assessment purposes and also for further characterizing the new in vivoPig-a gene mutation assay.",Is Melamine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 strain?,False
2,"The Salmonella/microsome assay is the most used assay for the evaluation of air particulate matter (PM) mutagenicity and a positive correlation between strain TA98 responses and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) levels in PM has been found. However, it seems that the major causes of PM mutagenicity in this assay are the nitro and oxy-PAHs. Salmonella YG5161, a 30-times more responsive strain to B[a]P has been developed. To verify if YG5161 strain was sufficiently sensitive to detect mutagenicity associated with B[a]P mutagenicity, PM samples were collected in Brazil and Sweden, extracted with toluene and tested in the Salmonella/microsome microsuspension assay. PAHs and B[a]P were determined and the extracts were tested with YG5161 and its parental strain TA1538. The extracts were also tested with YG1041 and its parental strain TA98. For sensitivity comparisons, we tested B[a]P and 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) using the same conditions. The minimal effective dose of B[a]P was 155 ng/plate for TA1538 and 7 ng/plate for YG5161. Although the maximum tested dose, 10 m(3) /plate containing 9 ng of B[a]P in the case of Brazilian sample, was sufficient to elicit a response in YG5161, mutagenicity was detected at a dose as low as 1 m(3) /plate (0.9 ng). This is probably caused by nitro-compounds that have been shown to be even more potent than B[a]P for YG5161. It seems that the mutagenicity of B[a]P present in PM is not detectable even with the use of YG5161 unless more efficient separation to remove the nitro-compounds from the PAH extract is performed.",Is 1-NP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
3,"We have designed and constructed a series of plasmids that contain the major and/or minor Escherichia coli nitroreductase genes, nfsA and nfsB, in different combinations with R plasmid mucA/B genes and the Salmonella typhimurium OAT gene. The plasmid encoded gene products are necessary for both the metabolic activation of a range of structurally diverse nitrosubstituted compounds, and for mutagenic translation bypass. Introduction of these plasmids into S. typhimurium TA1538 and TA1535 has created several new tester strains which exhibit an extremely high mutagenic sensitivity and a broad substrate specificity towards a battery of nitrosubstituted test compounds that included 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO), nitrofurazone (NF), 1-nitropyrene (1-NP), 2-nitronaphthalene (2-NN), 2-nitrofluorene (2-NF), and 1,6-dinitropyrene (1,6-DNP). Our studies show that the nfsA gene encodes a product that is extremely effective in the metabolic activation of a range of structurally diverse nitrosubstituted compounds. Several of the new tester strains are more than two orders of magnitude more sensitive to nitrosubstituted compounds than the Ames tester strains TA100 or TA98. In addition to enhancing mutagenic sensitivity, plasmids encoding both metabolic and mutagenesis functions on a single plasmid provide considerable flexibility for future mechanistic studies or tester strain development, in which it may be necessary to introduce additional plasmids containing different antibiotic resistance markers.",Is 1-NP mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
4,"The antimutagenicity of ethanol extracts of bee glue (propolis) (EEBG) was evaluated, using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 as a test model, against two direct mutagens, 4-nitro-O-phenylenediamine (4-NO) and 1-nitropyrene (1-NP), and two indirect mutagens, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) with S9 mix. EEBG was shown to suppress the mutagenicity of these compounds in a dose-dependent fashion. To delineate the mechanism of action of the antimutagenic effects of EEBG on the two indirect mutagens IQ and B[a]P, two possible points of blocking were considered: (1) cytochrome P-450 activity (route 1) and (2) interaction with microsome-generated proximate mutagens to generate an inactive complex (route 2). Our results clearly demonstrated, at a very low dose, remarkable suppression of the mutagenicity of both compounds by inhibiting either route 1 or route 2 pathway. Further studies indicated that EEBG was capable of inhibiting both the activities of hepatic cytochrome P-450 IA1-linked 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and IA 2-linked 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase (ECD) in a similar dose-dependent manner. Taken together, we demonstrated that EEBG was a good inhibitor for mutagenicity of direct mutagens, 1-NP and 4-NO, as well as for the indirect mutagens IQ and B[a]P in the presence of S9 mix via inactivation of microsomal enzyme activities (e.g. EROD and ECD) or antagonizing metabolic generation of the proximate mutagens of IQ and B[a]P.",Is 1-NP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
5,"1-Nitropyrene (1-NP) is a mutagenic nitro compound in the environment. We studied correlations between the mutagenicity of 1-NP for three strains of Salmonella typhimurium, the activity of bacterial nitroreductases and the amount of 1-NP-derived DNA adducts. Bacterial strains used in this study were S. typhimurium strains TA98, nitroreductase-less mutant TA98NR and YG1021 carrying a nitroreductase-producing plasmid. The mutagenicity of 1-NP was measured using the Ames assay, and the nitroreductase activities of these strains were assayed by quantification of 1-aminopyrene produced from 1-NP. The DNA adducts were measured by the 32P-postlabeling method. Among the three bacterial strains, strain YG1021 was the highest in mutagenicity of 1-NP, the nitroreductase activity and the DNA adduct level. However, S. typhimurium strain TA98NR had the lowest values of these three parameters. Nitroreductase activity, DNA adduct level and mutagenicity were strongly correlated with each other. These results indicate that bacterial nitroreductase plays an important role in forming the DNA adducts, and that the higher the adduct level the higher the level of mutagenicity.",Is 1-NP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
6,"To determine the role of cysteine conjugate beta-lyase (beta-lyase) in the metabolism of mutagenic nitropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, we determined the effect of beta-lyase on the mutagenicities and DNA binding of cysteine conjugates of 4,5-epoxy-4,5-dihydro-1-nitropyrene (1-NP 4,5-oxide) and 9,10-epoxy-9,10-dihydro-1-nitropyrene (1-NP 9,10-oxide), which are detoxified metabolites of the mutagenic compound 1-nitropyrene. We purified beta-lyase from Peptostreptococcus magnus GAI0663, since P. magnus is one of the constituents of the intestinal microflora and exhibits high levels of degrading activity with cysteine conjugates of 1-nitropyrene oxides (1-NP oxide-Cys). The activity of purified beta-lyase was optimal at pH 7.5 to 8.0, was completely inhibited by aminooxyacetic acid and hydroxylamine, and was eliminated by heating the enzyme at 55 degrees C for 5 min. The molecular weight of beta-lyase was 150,000, as determined by fast protein liquid chromatography. S-Arylcysteine conjugates were good substrates for this enzyme. As determined by the Salmonella mutagenicity test, 5 ng of beta-lyase protein increased the mutagenicity of the cysteine conjugate of 1-NP 9,10-oxide (10 nmol per plate) 4.5-fold in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and 4.1-fold in strain TA100. However, beta-lyase had little effect on the cysteine conjugate of 1-NP 4,5-oxide (10 nmol per plate). Both conjugates exhibited only low levels of mutagenicity with nitroreductase-deficient strain TA98NR. In vitro binding of 1-NP oxide-Cys to calf thymus DNA was increased by adding purified beta-lyase or xanthine oxidase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Is 1-NP mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
7,"Distributions of 1,3-dinitropyrene (1,3-DNP), 1,6-DNP, 1,8-DNP, 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) and mutagenicity in airborne particulates collected in downtown Kanazawa, Japan with an Andersen high-volume air sampler were examined. Mutagenicities of benzene-ethanol extract from particulates were determined by the Ames test using S. typhimurium strains without S9 mix, while concentrations of DNPs and 1-NP were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using chemiluminescence detection. In the finest particulate fraction (smaller than 1.1 microns), 68% and 75% of the total mutagenicities were observed in TA98 and YG1024 strains, respectively. In the same fraction, 65-82% of three DNPs as well as 84% of 1-NP were observed. Mutagenic contributions of 1,3-DNP, 1,6-DNP, 1,8-DNP and 1-NP in the extract were respectively 0.6, 1.2, 1.8 and 1.6% in the TA98 strain, and 2.5, 5, 9 and 2.1% in the YG1024 strain.",Is 1-NP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
8,"Polygonum cuspidatum S. (PC) is frequently used as a laxative and an anticancer drug in Chinese medicine. The inhibitory effect of this herb and its component, emodin, on the direct-acting mutagenicity of 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) was examined using the Ames/microsomal test with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and the genotoxicity of 1-NP was evaluated using the SOS chromotest with E. coli PQ37. Emodin and water extracts of PC markedly decreased the mutagenicity of 1-NP in a dose-dependent manner in both assay systems. Furthermore, emodin and the extracts of PC significantly inhibited the formation of 1-NP DNA adducts in S. typhimurium TA98 in the 32P-postlabeling study. The results suggest that PC extracts and emodin act as blocking and/or suppressing agents to reduce the direct-acting mutagenicity of 1-NP.",Is 1-NP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
9,"The use of 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) as a marker for the occupational exposure to diesel exhaust (DE) mutagens was investigated in workplace atmospheres contaminated with DE from a variety of emission sources, such as power supplies, forklifts, trucks, caterpillar vehicles, trains, ships' engines, and vehicles in city traffic. Total suspended particulate matter was collected by area sampling. The 1-NP content of acetone extracts of these samples as determined by gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry varied from 0.080 to 17 micrograms/g acetone extractable matter, corresponding to air concentrations of 0.012 to 1.2 ng/m3. A sample collected in a rural area contained 0.0017 ng/m3 1-NP. The mutagenicity of the extracts was tested in the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA1538, using the microsuspension assay with and without metabolic activation by an exogeneous metabolizing system (rat liver S9-fraction). In addition, the S. typhimurium strains YG1021 and YG1024 were used because of their high sensitivity towards the mutagenicity of nitro polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. When plotting the mutagenic potency of the air sample extracts as determined in the absence of liver S9 versus the particle-associated 1-NP level, a relatively high correlation (r = 0.80-0.91) was observed in all of the S. typhimurium strains. High correlations (r = 0.80-0.93) were also observed when plotting the results of mutagenicity testing after activation by S9 versus the outcome of chemical analysis. These results show that the 1-NP content of workplace air samples is associated with their mutagenic potency, suggesting that 1-NP may be used as a marker for occupational exposure to DE-derived particle-associated mutagens.",Is 1-NP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
10,"Kaohsiung is a city of 1.5 million located in the southern part of Taiwan. It has a serious air pollution problem mainly attributable to much industrial and commercial activity. In order to estimate the effects of traffic, season, and meteorological conditions on the mutagenicity of Kaohsiung City's urban ambient particulate matter, 624 airborne particulate samples were collected on a weekly basis from 12 locations for an entire year. The mutagenic potential of acetone extracts of air samples was evaluated by the Salmonella/microsomal test with S. typhimurium TA98 in the presence and absence of S9 mixtures. The air samples from November 1990 showed the highest direct and indirect mutagenicity among the 12 months, whereas those from June and July 1991 had the lowest direct and indirect mutagenic activity, respectively. The mutagenicity showed a good correlation with amounts of the acetone extractable matter of airborne particulates. The meteorological conditions, monthly mean precipitation, and wind speed also showed a good correspondence with mutagenicity. Wind direction and temperature had a moderate relationship. The major mutagenic fractions of air samples that had the highest mutagenic activity in a month were purified using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography, and the contents of PAHs, 1-NP, and DNPs were analyzed by HPLC. The characteristic concentration ratios of PAHs indicated that, for the main pollution sources of airborne particulates from Kaohsiung city, the mobile sources were more important than the stationary ones. The total amounts of 1-NP and DNPs in airborne particulates seemed to correspond to their mutagenicity. Although the total amounts of 1-NP and DNPs in the air samples correlated with their mutagenicity, the major mutagenic chemicals in the airborne particulate samples from Kaohsiung City need further investigation.",Is 1-NP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
11,"To learn the reasons for the high incidence of biliary carcinoma in patients with anomalous arrangement of the pancreaticobiliary duct (APBD) mutagenicity of the bile of APBD-modeled dogs that had received a dorsal pancreatico-cholecystostomy was assayed by the Ames Salmonella mutation test. The bile from two out of 18 APBD dogs was mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 under the condition of metabolic activation by rat liver S9 fraction, while the bile from 17 normal dogs was not mutagenic. Furthermore, the bile from five APBD dogs i.p. administered 1-nitropyrene (1-NP), which is a typical environmental mutagen, was more mutagenic for strain TA98 than that from 1-NP-treated normal dogs. The bile from the APBD dogs had very high amylase activity, indicating that the bile contained pancreatic juice as a result of the pancreatico-cholecystostomy. When pancreatic juice from a normal dog was added to the bile from 1-NP-treated normal dogs, mutagenicity of the bile increased 1.6- to 2.0-fold. Furthermore, sulfatase increased the mutagenic activity of the bile in the presence of the pancreatic juice. HPLC revealed that the bile from a 1-NP-treated APBD dog contained mutagenic 1-nitro-6/8-hydroxypyrene and 1-nitro-3-hydroxypyrene, while bile from a 1-NP-treated normal dog did not contain these deconjugated products. The pancreatic juice from a normal dog had very high gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and aminopeptidase activities and low sulfatase activity, but it had no beta-glucuronidase activity. In addition, the bacteria that easily infect the biliary duct of APBD dogs, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Proteus, had high beta-glucuronidase activity. In particular, Klebsiella showed a very high sulfatase activity. These results suggest that pancreatic juice enzymes and bacteria infecting the biliary duct deconjugate the detoxified mutagens in the bile and induce mutagenicity of the bile from APBD dogs or APBD patients.",Is 1-NP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
12,"N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) has been reported to decrease genotoxicity induced by several mutagens. In this paper, the desmutagenic effect of NAC on a complex mixture, such as diesel extract, has been analyzed. Studies have been carried out in vitro with the Ames test (reverse mutations on TA98, TA100, and TA104 strains) and sister chromatid exchanges assay (SCE) in human lymphocytes. NAC inhibits diesel genotoxicity in both assays. NAC also inhibits the mutagenicity of 1,8-dinitropyrene (1,8-DNP) and 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) known to be present in diesel exhaust and to be activated by cellular O-transacetylases and nitropyrene reductases. NAC inhibits also the induction of SCE in human lymphocytes by diesel extract. These results, and those obtained by the preincubation of NAC with cells, suggest that the inhibition also takes place inside the cell.",Is 1-NP mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
13,"1-Nitropyrene (1-NP) and 2-nitrofluorene (2-NF), two of the most abundant nitro-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAH) present in combustion products such as diesel engine exhaust, were administered intraperitoneally to rats at a dose of 5 mg per animal. Urine samples, 1-NP and 2-NF were tested in the Ames assay using the newly developed Salmonella typhimurium strains YG1012 and YG1024 (overproducing O-acetyltransferase) and their parent strains TA1538 and TA98. In urine, collected over 3 periods of 24 h after administration, most of the mutagens appeared during the first 24 h. The mutagenicity was found to be a factor 2-30 higher in the YG strains when compared to the TA strains. Addition of S9 mix and rat liver cytosol both with and without beta-glucuronidase increased the mutagenicity of urine samples from 1-NP-treated rats. Addition of beta-glucuronidase revealed that a considerable part of the mutagenic metabolites of 1-NP and 2-NF were excreted as glucuronide conjugates. The increase in mutagenicity of urine samples from 2-NF-treated rats after the addition of rat liver cytosol referred to N,O-acyl transfer as a step in activating 2-NF to strong mutagens. The high sensitivity of the YG tester strains indicated that these strains might be used to explore environments where people are exposed to nitro-PAH, such as work places with diesel emission sources.",Is 1-NP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
14,"To investigate the modifying role of intestinal microflora in the metabolism of chemical carcinogens in vivo, we subjected bile from Fischer rats treated per os with chemical carcinogens and related compounds to a mutagenicity assay in the presence and absence of a cell-free extract from human feces. A mixture of the bile sample and potassium phosphate buffer was incubated in the presence or absence of human cell-free fecal extract and then further incubated with a bacterial suspension of Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98 or TA100. Bile from rats treated with 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) produced about 2700 and 400 revertants per plate in strain TA98 in the presence and absence of the fecal extract, respectively. There was a drug dose- and bile volume-related response. Treatment of 1-NP-bile with beta-glucuronidase, but not aryl sulfatase, enhanced its mutagenicity. Cell-free extracts of some strains of intestinal bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 12044, B. vulgatus ATCC 8482, B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC 12290, Bacteroides sp. strain 524, Eubacterium eligens VPI C15-48, Peptostreptococcus sp. strain 204 and Escherichia coli A-5-18) also enhanced the mutagenicity of 1-NP-bile. These bacterial cell-free extracts hydrolyzed the synthetic beta-D-glucuronides of phenolphthalein and/or p-nitrophenol. These data indicate that the glucuronide(s) of 1-NP-metabolite(s) secreted into bile can be hydrolyzed in the intestine by bacterial beta-glucuronidases to potent mutagenic aglycone(s).",Is 1-NP mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
15,"Wastewater collected from oil-water separating tanks of ten gasoline stations for a year was fractionated into diethyl ether-soluble neutral, acidic, and basic fractions. Mutagenicity of these fractions was measured with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence or absence of S9 mix. The neutral fractions showed high mutagenicity in the absence of S9 mix. Each neutral fraction was subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and fractionated. A 1-nitropyrene(1-NP)-corresponding fraction was collected and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and HPLC to prove that wastewater contains 1-NP and to quantitate 1-NP in wastewater. GC-MS patterns showed the following molecular and fragment ion peaks of 1-NP: 247, 217, 201, and 189. The amount of 1-NP in 36 samples of wastewater was 4.2-25,600 ng per liter of wastewater, and 1-NP accounted for 0.3-58.5% of the total mutagenicity of the neutral fractions. The other 19 samples of wastewater did not contain any detectable 1-NP. The mutagenicity of wastewater may be due to water from car washing and contamination by used crankcase oil. A Soxhlet extract of crankcase oil used in a gasoline was fractionated into three fractions as above. Mutagenicity was measured with strains TA98, TA100, TA98NR, and TA98/1,8-DNP6 in the absence or presence of S9 mix. The neutral fraction showed the highest mutagenicity with strain TA98 in the absence of S9 mix, and its mutagenicity was decreased in strains TA98NR and TA98/1,8-DNP6. The latter result indicates that the used engine-oil contained 1-NP and dinitropyrenes. Actually, the amounts of 1-NP and 1,6-diNP in used crankcase oil were 138 and 2.0 ng per ml of oil, respectively, and these concentrations accounted for 0.45 and 2.7%, respectively, of the total mutagenicity of the neutral fraction with strain TA98 in the absence of S9 mix. Moreover, the concentrations of 1-NP and 1,6-diNP in used crankcase oil of a diesel engine were 349 and 31 ng per ml of oil, respectively, accounting for 0.9 and 12%, respectively, of the total mutagenicity of the neutral fraction in the same assay system.",Is 1-NP mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
16,"The mutagenic activities of 1-nitropyrene (1-NP), 2,7-dinitrofluorenone (2,7-DNF), and a diesel-exhaust extract were compared using the Salmonella typhimurium plate-incorporation assay. Each sample was tested with and without a 9000 X g liver homogenate (S9), both with and without an NADPH-generating system. The samples were also treated with the microsome fraction of S9, cytosol fraction of S9, boiled S9, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and boiled BSA. Salmonella tester strains TA98 and TA98FR1 were used in all treatments; TA98/1,8DNP6 was used to test mutagenic activity without activation. Without the NADPH-generating system, the samples generally had less mutagenic activity than samples treated with the NADPH-generating system. The addition of the NADPH-generating system resulted in marked increases in mutagenic activity of 1-NP in the microsome and S9 treatments, and of all 3 samples in the cytosol fraction treatment. These results indicate that although protein binding reduced the mutagenic activity of diesel-exhaust extract and 1-NP, microsomal activation increased the mutagenic activity of 1-NP. Because 1-NP and 2,7-DNF contributed less than 1.5% of the mutagenic activity of the diesel-exhaust extract, the response to diesel exhaust was not typified by these compounds.",Is 1-NP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
17,"Mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-Nitropyrene (1-NP) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of S9 fraction in the Salmonella-microsome test. It is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-NP and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. We determined the 1-NP nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. We found that the mutagenicity of 1-NP mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. The product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-AP), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. The 1-NP nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the anaerobic bacteria, i.e., Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. nucleatum, Clostridium perfringens, C. sporogenes, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, Eubacterium lentum, E. limosum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-NP to 1-AP and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-NP.",Is 1-NP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
18,"We investigated the photo-mutagenicity and photo-genotoxicity of N-dialkylnitrosamines and its mechanisms of UVA activation. With simultaneous irradiation of UVA, photo-mutagenicity of seven N-dialkylnitrosamines was observed in Ames bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium TA1535) in the absence of metabolic activation. Mutagenicity of pre-irradiated N-dialkylnitrosamines was also observed with S. typhimurium hisG46, TA100, TA102 and YG7108 in the absence of metabolic activation. UVA-mediated mutation with N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) decreased by adding either the NO or OH radical scavenger. When superhelical DNA was irradiated with N-dialkylnitrosamines, nicked circular DNA appeared. Ten N-dialkylnitrosamines examined produced strand breaks in the treated DNA in the presence of UVA. The level of single-strand breaks in phiX174 DNA mediated by N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) and UVA decreased by adding either a radical scavenger or superoxide dismutase. When calf thymus DNA was treated with N-dialkylnitrosamines (NDMA, NDEA, NMOR, N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) and N-nitrosopiperidine (NPIP)) and UVA, the ratio of 8-oxodG/dG in the DNA increased. Action spectra were obtained to determine if nitrosamine acts as a sensitizer of UVA. Both mutation frequency and NO formation were highest at the absorption maximum of nitrosamines, approximately 340 nm. The plots of NO formation and mutation frequency align with the absorption curve of NPYR, NMOR and NDMA. A significant linear correlation between the optical density of N-dialkynitrosamines at 340 nm and NO formation in each irradiated solution was revealed by ANOVA. We would like to propose the hypothesis that the N-nitroso moiety of N-dialkylnitrosamines absorbs UVA photons, UVA-photolysis of N-dialkylnitrosamines brings release of nitric oxide, and subsequent production of alkyl radical cations and active oxygen species follow as secondary events, which cause DNA strand breaks, oxidative and alkylative DNA damages and mutation.",Is NMOR mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 strain?,True
19,"An investigation was undertaken to determine whether analgesics and their derivatives (13 compounds), and anti-inflammatory drugs (4 compounds) had mutagenicity. Rec-assay was used to clarify specific DNA-damaging properties, and the Ames test was used to find back-mutations, using S-9 fractions obtained from the liver of 4 animal species pretreated with polychlorobiphenyl. In the Rec-assay, salicylic acid (2 mg), aspirin (5 mg), benzoic acid (4 mg), sulpyrine (0.4 mg), indomethacin (0.1 mg), oxyphenbutazone (0.1 mg) and diclofenac sodium (0.1 mg) showed a DNA-damaging tendency. In the Ames test, mutagenicity of methyl salicylate was demonstrated using the Salmonella typhimurium TA98 strain upon addition of hamster S-9 mixture. Weak mutagenicity was also found using the TA100 strain with rat S-9 mixture for salicylic acid, sulpyrine, indomethacin and oxyphenbutazone, and with hamster S-9 mixture for methyl salicylate, acetaminophen and phenacetine.",Is benzoic acid mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

In the present study, six artificial polycyclic musk fragrances-Galaxolide, Tonalide, Celestolide, Phantolide, Cashmeran and Traseolide-were tested for mutagenicity using the Salmonella/mammalian-microsome assay with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102 in the presence (+S-9) and absence (-S-9) of an exogenous metabolizing system. All compounds tested exhibited no mutagenicity in the Salmonella assay.

21,"The XAD-2 resin concentration/elution system for concentration of mutagens contained in urines was optimized for cancer patients who had been administered such antineoplastic agents as adriamycin (ADR; doxorubicin), cyclophosphamide (CP), methotrexate, vincristine, and 5-fluorouracil. In the reverse mutation assay, Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535 and TA98 differentiated between CP (with S9 fraction) and ADR (without S9), respectively. No dose-response for CP was observed. There was a dose-response to ADR by TM677 in the presence of S9 using a forward mutation assay. However, while the reverse mutation assays successfully detected ADR and CP administration in the presence of each other in terms of urine mutagenicity, the forward mutation assay did not, since unidentified CP metabolites were also detected in the latter. None of these systems detected mutagenic urines from tobacco smokers, although reaction of these urines with beta-glucuronidase allowed this type of source to be detected also.",Is ADR mutagenic for TA98 or TA1535 strain?,False
22,"The genotoxicity and mutagenicity of 11 fungal metabolites structurally related to sterigmatocystin were examined in the hepatocyte primary culture/DNA-repair test and the Salmonella microsome assay. 10 out of the mycotoxins, i.e. dihydrosterigmatocystin, 5-methoxysterigmatocystin, 5-methoxydihydrosterigmatocystin, 5,6-dimethoxysterigmatocystin, 5,6-dimethoxydihydrosterigmatocystin, sterigmatin, O-methylsterigmatocystin and O-acetylsterigmatocystin showed a positive response for DNA repair, suggesting their carcinogenic potency. 5-Methoxysterigmatocystin, 5,6-dimethoxysterigmatocystin demethylsterigmatocystin and O-acetylsterigmatocystin were mutagenic in TA100 of the bacterial mutagenicity assay with liver S9.",Is 5-Methoxysterigmatocystin mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
23,"Methyl carbamate is used as a chemical intermediate by the textile industry for the manufacture of dimethylol methyl carbamate-based resins that are applied on polyester/cotton blend fabrics as durable-press finishes. Experimental Design: Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of methylyl carbamate (98% pure) were conducted by exposing groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice by gavage in water in a single dose and by repeated administration for 16 days, 13 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 2 years. In addition, short-term mutagenicity studies in bacteria, mammalian cells, and Drosophila and of unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat liver cells were conducted. Single-Administration Studies: In the single-administration studies, 5/5 male and 5/5 female rats that received 8,000 mg/kg methyl carbamate and 2/5 male and 5/5 female that received 4,000 mg/kg died before the end of the 15-day observational period. Five of five male and 5/5 female mice that received 8,000 mg/kg and 1/5 females that received 4,000 mg/kg died before the end of the 15-day observational period. No compound-related morphologic effects were observed in rats or mice that received 2,000 mg/kg. Sixteen-Day Studies: In the 16-day studies, all rats dosed at 2,000 or 4,000 mg/kg died, and 3/5 male rats that received 1,000 mg/kg died. Male mice that received 2,000 or 4,000 mg/kg, female mice that received 4,000 mg/kg, and 1/5 female mice that received 2,000 mg/kg died. No compound-related gross pathologic or histopathologic effects were seen in male or female rats (groups of five each) that received 500 mg/kg or in mice that received 1,000 mg/kg. Thirteen-Week Studies: In the 13-week studies, groups of 10 male and 10 female rats and mice received up to 800 mg/kg (male rats), 1,000 mg/kg (female rats), 1,500 mg/kg (male mice), or 2,000 mg/kg (female mice). Four of 10 male rats that received 800 mg/kg and 1/10 female rats that received 1,000 mg/kg died of compound-related causes before the end of the studies. Toxic hepatitis, splenic pigmentation, bone marrow atrophy, and testicular atrophy were observed in the two highest dose groups of rats. One of the female mice that received 2,000 mg/kg died. The dosed female mice had significantly greater liver weights than did the vehicle controls. Experimental Design of Six-, Twelve-, and Eighteen-Month and Two-Year Studies: Based on the findings in the short-term studies, 2-year studies of methyl carbamate were conducted by administering 0, 100, or 200 mg/kg methyl carbamate in distilled water by gavage, 5 days per week for 103 weeks, to groups of 50 F344/N rats of each sex for 103 weeks. Groups of 50 B6C3F1 mice of each sex were administered 0, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg methyl carbamate on the same schedule. Additional groups of 30 rats of each sex were administered 0 or 400 mg/kg methyl carbamate, and additional groups of 30 mice of each sex were administered 0 or 1,000 mg/kg methyl carbamate in distilled water by gavage, 5 days per week. Ten animals from each group were killed at 6, 12, or 18 months so that the progression of lesions could be followed. Results of the Six-, Twelve-, and Eighteen-Month and Two-Year Studies: In the 6-month studies, all vehicle control and dosed (400 mg/kg) rats survived. Cytologic alterations and atypical proliferative changes were observed in the liver of all dosed male and female rats, and neoplastic nodules of the liver were observed in 6/10 dosed male and 5/10 dosed female rats. In the 12-month studies, all vehicle control male and female rats and dosed female rats survived. One of 10 dosed male rats died. Neoplastic nodules of the liver were observed in 7/10 dosed male and 9/10 dosed female rats, and hepatocellular carcinomas were observed in 8/10 dosed male and 6/10 dosed female rats. In the 18-month studies, 1/10 dosed male and 8/10 dosed female and all vehicle control rats survived. Hepatocellular carcinomas were observed in 9/10 dosed male and 8/10 dosed female rats. Compound-related neoplastic changes were not observed in mice in the 6-, 12-, or 18-month studies. In the 2-year studar studies, mean body weights of high dose (200 mg/kg) male rats were generally 5&percnt;-9&percnt; lower than those of the vehicle controls after week 20. Mean body weights of high dose female rats were 5&percnt;-8&percnt; lower than those of the vehicle controls after week 56. Survival of dosed and vehicle control rats was similar (male: vehicle control, 19/50; low dose, 26/50; high dose, 29/50; female: 29/50; 36/50; 35/50). The mean body weights of high dose (1,000 mg/kg) male mice were about 8&percnt;-18&percnt; lower than those of the vehicle controls after week 24. The mean body weights of high dose (1,000 mg/kg) female mice were about 16&percnt; lower than those of the vehicle controls after week 16 and 30&percnt; lower after week 64. Survival of dosed and vehicle control mice was similar (male: 28/50; 35/50; 28/50; female: 38/50; 36/50; 32/50). Chronic focal inflammation and cytologic alteration of the liver were observed at increased incidences in high dose rats of each sex. Hyperplasia of hepatocytes was observed atincreased incidences in dosed male and high dose female rats. Neoplastic nodules or hepatocellular carcinomas (combined) in female rats occurred with a significant positive trend (0/50; 0/50; 6/49; P&lt;0.01); the incidence of neoplastic nodules or hepatocellular carcinomas (combined) in high dose female rats was greater (P&lt;0.03) than that in the vehicle controls. Incidences of liver neoplasms in dosed male rats were not significantly increased (4/50; 0/50; 7/49). Inflammation of the harderian gland was observed at increased incidences in dosed rats (male: 4/50; 11/50; 16/50; female: 7/50; 16/50; 30/50). The lesions were considered to be chemically related. In the 2-year studies in rats, significant decreases in tumor incidences included the following: leukemia (both sexes), pituitary gland (male), adrenal gland (male), and mammary gland (female). In the 2-year mouse studies, multinucleate giant cells in the liver were observed at increased incidences in dosed male mice (14/50; 31/50; 31/49). Adenomatous hyperplasia and histiocytosis of the lung were observed at increased incidences in high dose mice (adenomatous hyperplasia--male: 13/50; 19/50; 24/49; female: 7/49; 10/50; 18/50; histiocytosis--male: 11/50; 7/50; 21/49; female: 9/49; 10/50; 21/50). Genetic Toxicology: Methyl carbamate was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, or TA1535 when tested with or without metabolic activation in a preincubation protocol at doses up to 10 mg/plate. Methyl carbamate did not induce forward mutations in the mouse L5178Y/TK&plusmn; lymphoma assay with or without metabolicactivation at doses up to 5 mg/ml. Unscheduled DNA synthesis was not detected in rat hepatocytes after in vitro treatment with methyl carbamate at concentrations of 1.0-1,000 ug/ml. When tested in Drosophila at doses of 25,000-50,000 ppm, methyl carbamate did not induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations. Results of tests for induction of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges by methyl carbamate in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells were also negative at doses up to 5 mg/ml. Data Audit: An audit of the experimental data was conducted for the 6-, 12-, and 18-month and 2-year studies of methyl carbamate. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretation. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 6-, 12-, and 18-month and 2-year gavage studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for male and female F344/N rats given methyl carbamate as indicated by increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplastic nodules and hepatocellular carcinomas. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for male and female B6C3F1 mice given methyl carbamate at doses of 500 or 1,000 mg/kg. Methyl carbamate also induced inflammation of the harderian gland in male and female rats and adenomatous hyperplasia and histiocytosis of the lung in male and female mice.

26,"Paraquat is univalently reduced to the relatively stable, but oxygen-sensitive, paraquat radical (PQ.+). This PQ.+ can react with dioxygen to generate the superoxide radical, which can further generate other more deleterious species of oxygen free radicals (i.e., hydroxyl radical, OH.). These oxygen free radicals are known to cause chromosomal breaks; therefore, it was logical to postulate that paraquat is a mutagen. This proved to be the case when tested in a modified Ames test using a liquid incubation assay. Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 were grown in the presence of various concentrations of PQ, as well as in the presence of known mutagenic compounds: mitomycin C, azide, and proflavine. Paraquat was much more toxic and mutagenic in a simple nutritionally restricted medium than in a rich complex medium and these toxic and mutagenic effects were oxygen dependent. Furthermore, cells containing high levels of superoxide dismutase were more resistant to the toxic and mutagenic effects of paraquat than were cells containing a normal level of this enzyme.",Is Paraquat mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

Salmonella typhimurium/Escherichia coli plate incorporation and liquid preincubation assays were conducted on AHTN using tester strains TA97, TA98, TA100, TA102, TA1535, TA1537 and WP2 uvrA +/- S9 activation at doses from 8 to 5000 micrograms/plate. The plate incorporation mutagenicity assay was conducted on HHCB using tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, TA1538 and WP2 uvrA +/- S9 activation at doses from 10 to 5000 micrograms/plate. An in vitro cytogenetics assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was conducted with AHTN and HHCB at three concentrations each with +/- S9 activation. In the non-activated study, the exposure/harvest periods were 4/20-, 20/20- and 44/44-h. In the S9 activated study, the exposure/harvest periods were 4/20- and 4/44-h. In vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assays were conducted in primary rat hepatocytes at concentrations between 0.15 and 50 micrograms/ml for AHTN and HHCB. In vivo mouse micronucleus assays were conducted with high doses of 1600 mg AHTN/kg and of 1500 mg HHCB/kg in corn oil. No positive responses were observed in any of the tests with HHCB. With AHTN, no positive responses were observed except for cells with structural aberrations in the in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO cells with S9 activation at the treatment/harvest time of 4/20 h. In initial studies with AHTN, the high dose of 7.8 micrograms/ml showed 0.5% aberrant cells, with the mitotic index at 41% relative to vehicle control and cell growth inhibition in the range of 25-50%. Thus the genotoxicity findings with AHTN were limited to this one positive response; all other genotoxicity tests with AHTN were considered as negative. In particular, the negative finding in the in vivo assay supports AHTN as not likely to be mutagenic in mammalian systems. These considerations, along with other negative published data, lead to the conclusion that both AHTN and HHCB do not have significant potential to act as genotoxic carcinogens.",Is AHTN mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
29,"Pentamidine, DAPI and some related compounds (DAI, 6-Br-AI, DPTN, DIPI, 3-Am-DAI, DiaPBF) were investigated in 2 different screening test systems for their potential mutagenic and cytotoxic effects, in the light of their binding to DNA. In the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 with and without metabolic activation no mutagenic effects could be observed. All diamidines tested, except DAI, were toxic at concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0 mumole/plate. In the sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) assay with human peripheral lymphocytes all compounds tested were growth-retarding particularly in the G0 phase. A significant induction of SCEs could only be seen after treatment with the monoamidino compound 6-Br-AI at a concentration of 100 mumole/l.

Estimation of the GSH concentration and GSH S-transferase activity in extracts of these strains and of TA100 indicates that the GSH- derivatives contain 10-30% of the GSH level found in TA100, and that they exhibit normal GSH S-transferase activity. The mutagenic activities of 7 chemicals, namely, MNNG, ENNG, 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE), 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), styrene-7,8-oxide (STOX), N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) were compared in TA100 and in one representative GSH- strain, denominated NG-57. MNNG, ENNG, DBE and CDNB are potent to extremely potent mutagens in TA100, but induce very low levels of His+ mutants in NG-57. Pretreatment of NG-57 with 1 mM GSH (partially) restores the mutant yields to the levels usually found in TA100. The mutagenic activities of STOX, ENU and MMS are similar in both strains. These results support some previous findings, namely that ENNG, MNNG and DBE, but not ENU are activated to mutagens inside the test bacteria, and also suggest that CDNB is activated by bacterial GSH. The latter finding is in contrast with the current view that CDNB is detoxified by GSH, as is also presently evidenced by a strong reduction of the compound's mutagenicity in the presence of extracts of rat liver, which contains GSH and GSH S-transferase activity. The results with STOX indicate that GSH plays in bacteria a much less important role in the detoxification of xenobiotics than in mammalian tissue, presumably due to a much lower GSH S-transferase activity in the first organism.","Is 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene mutagenic for TA100 strain?",True
32,"Levels of the tripeptide glutathione (GSH) and the activity of glutathione S-transferases were investigated in S9 fractions of rats and mice and in Salmonella typhymurium tester strains TA1535, TA100, TA1538 and TA98.

36,"Benzo[a]pyrene (BP) and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DBP) are two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that exhibit distinctly different mutagenicity and carcinogenicity profiles. Although some studies show that these PAHs produce unstable DNA adducts, conflicting data and arguments have been presented regarding the relative roles of these unstable adducts versus stable adducts, as well as oxidative damage, in the mutagenesis and tumor-mutation spectra of these PAHs. However, no study has determined the mutation spectra along with the stable and unstable DNA adducts in the same system with both PAHs. Thus, we determined the mutagenic potencies and mutation spectra of BP and DBP in strains TA98, TA100 and TA104 of Salmonella, and we also measured the levels of abasic sites (aldehydic-site assay) and characterized the stable DNA adducts ((32)P-postlabeling/HPLC) induced by these PAHs in TA104. Our results for the mutation spectra and site specificity of stable adducts were consistent with those from other systems, showing that DBP was more mutagenic than BP in TA98 and TA100. The mutation spectra of DBP and BP were significantly different in TA98 and TA104, with 24% of the mutations induced by BP in TA98 being complex frameshifts, whereas DBP produced hardly any of these mutations. In TA104, BP produced primarily GC to TA transversions, whereas DBP produced primarily AT to TA transversions. The majority (96%) of stable adducts induced by BP were at guanine, whereas the majority (80%) induced by DBP were at adenine. Although BP induced abasic sites, DBP did not. Most importantly, the proportion of mutations induced by DBP at adenine and guanine paralleled the proportion of stable DNA adducts induced by DBP at adenine and guanine; however, this was not the case for BP. Our results leave open a possible role for unstable DNA adducts in the mutational specificity of BP but not for DBP.",Is DBP mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
37,"The mutagenic activities of several structurally related dibromo compounds were compared in Salmonella strains sensitive to base substitution mutagenesis (TA1535 and/or TA100) and in the glutathione (GSH)-deficient derivative TA100/NG-57, using a preincubation procedure. The compounds tested were 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE), 1,2-dibromopropane (DBP), 1,2-dibromo-1-phenylethane (DBPE) and model compounds for the half-mustards resulting from their conjugation with GSH, i.e. the N-acetyl-S-2-bromoalkyl-L-cysteine methyl esters SBE, SBP, and SBPE, respectively. The alkylating potential of all compounds was assayed with the 4-(p-nitrobenzyl)pyridine (NBP) alkylation test. Five of the compounds showed a good correlation between relative mutagenic activity in TA100 and electrophilic reactivity in the NBP-test, the order of decreasing potency being SBE greater than SBP greater than DBPE greater than DBP. SBPE displayed the highest reactivity in the NBP-test, but was devoid of mutagenic activity. The mutagenic activity of DBE was substantially decreased in the GSH-deficient strain TA100/NG-57 and could be restored by pretreating the cells with GSH. None of the other chemicals showed different mutagenic activities in TA100 and TA100/NG-57. From the results it can be concluded that 2-bromothioethers possess higher alkylating activities than the 1,2-dibromo compounds. Methyl substitution has a deactivating effect on the mutagenic activity. The results with the phenyl-substituted analogue, DBPE, show that a higher alkylating activity does not always lead to a higher mutagenic activity.",Is DBP mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False

Ethylbenzene was nominated for study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) because of its potential for widespread human exposure and because of its structural similarity to benzene and toluene. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to ethylbenzene (greater than 99% pure) by inhalation for 2 years.

In previously reported 13-week toxicity studies in which F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to ethylbenzene by whole body inhalation exposure, no histopathologic changes were observed (NTP, 1992). 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats were exposed to 0, 75, 250, or 750 ppm ethylbenzene by inhalation, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 104 weeks. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings Survival of male rats in the 750 ppm group was significantly less than that of the chamber controls. Mean body weights of 250 and 750 ppm males were generally less than those of the chamber controls beginning at week 20. Mean body weights of exposed groups of females were generally less than those of chamber controls during the second year of the study. Pathology Findings In male rats exposed to 750 ppm, the incidences of renal tubule adenoma and adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly greater than the chamber control incidences. In addition, the incidence of renal tubule hyperplasia in 750 ppm males was significantly greater than that in the chamber controls. The findings from an extended evaluation (step section) of the kidneys showed a significant increase in the incidences of renal tubule adenoma and hyperplasia in 750 ppm males and females; the incidence of renal tubule adenoma or carcinoma (combined) was significantly increased in 750 ppm males. The severities of nephropathy in 750 ppm male and all exposed female rats were significantly increased relative to the chamber controls. The incidence of interstitial cell adenoma in the testis of 750 ppm males was significantly greater than that in the chamber control group and slightly exceeded the historical control range for inhalation studies. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 75, 250, or 750 ppm ethylbenzene by inhalation, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 103 weeks. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings Survival of exposed groups of male and female mice was similar to that of the chamber controls. Mean body weights of female mice exposed to 75 ppm were greater than those of the chamber controls from week 72 until the end of the study. Pathology Findings In 750 ppm males, the incidences of alveolar/ bronchiolar adenoma and alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly greater than those in the chamber control group but were within the NTP historical control ranges. The incidence of alveolar epithelial metaplasia in 750 ppm males was significantly greater than that in the chamber controls. In 750 ppm females, the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly greater than those in the chamber control group but were within the historical control ranges. The incidence of eosinophilic foci in 750 ppm females was significantly increased compared to that in the chamber controls. There was a spectrum of nonneoplastic liver changes related to ethylbenzene exposure in male mice, including syncytial alteration of hepatocytes, hepatocellular hypertrophy, and hepatocyte necrosis. rosis. The incidences of hyperplasia of the pituitary gland pars distalis in 250 and 750 ppm females and the incidences of thyroid gland follicular cell hyperplasia in 750 ppm males and females were significantly increased compared to those in the chamber control groups. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Ethylbenzene gave little indication of mutagenicity, in vitro or in vivo. No induction of mutations was noted in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA97, TA98, TA100, or TA1535 with or without S9 metabolic activation, and no increases in sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations were observed in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells treated with ethylbenzene, with or without S9. In the mouse lymphoma assay, a significant mutagenic response was noted in the absence of S9, but only at the highest nonlethal dose tested and with accompanying cytotoxicity; the test was not performed with S9. No increases in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes were observed in vivo in peripheral blood samples from male and female mice exposed to ethylbenzene for 13 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year inhalation studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of ethylbenzene in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of renal tubule neoplasms. The incidences of testicular adenoma were also increased. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of ethylbenzene in female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of renal tubule adenomas. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of ethylbenzene in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of ethylbenzene in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms. Exposure of male and female rats to ethylbenzene resulted in increased incidences of renal tubule hyperplasia and increased severities of nephropathy. Exposure of male mice to ethylbenzene resulted in increased incidences of alveolar epithelial metaplasia, syncytial alteration of hepatocytes, hepatocellular hypertrophy, hepatocyte necrosis, and thyroid gland follicular cell hyperplasia. In female mice, ethylbenzene exposure resulted in increased incidences of eosinophilic foci of the liver, pituitary gland pars distalis hyperplasia, and thyroid gland follicular cell hyperplasia.

39,"(1-Chloroethenyl)oxirane (CEO) is a metabolite of beta-chloroprene (2-chloro-1,3-butadiene, CD). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro mutagenic and clastogenic (chromosome breaking) potential of CEO. For comparative purposes, the study also included an evaluation of the racemic compounds, 3,4-epoxy-1-butene (EB) and 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB). Mutagenicity was evaluated in a bacterial reverse mutation test (Ames), using the pre-incubation method in the presence and absence of an exogenous metabolism system (Aroclor)-induced rat liver S9). Four Salmonella typhimurium tester strains, TA97a, TA98, TA100 and TA1535 were used. The exposure concentrations in the sealed incubation vials ranged from 0 to 69 mM for CEO, 0 to 102 mM for EB, and 0 to 83 mM for DEB. All three compounds showed signs of toxicity, with DEB being substantially more toxic than either CEO or EB. Mutagenic activity was observed with all three chemicals in primarily the base pair substitution strains (S. typhimurium TA100 and TA1535), but some activity was also seen in the frameshift elimination strains (S. typhimurium TA97a and TA98). The observed mutagenic responses after exposure with CEO or EB were greater than the observed response for DEB, most likely because of the higher toxicity of DEB. Generally, the mutagenic responses were unchanged in the frameshift strains and base pair substitution strains in the presence of S9 metabolism. In vitro clastogenicity was evaluated using the cytochalasin-B blocked micronucleus test in cultured Chinese hamster V79 cells. The test was conducted without S9 metabolism because of the absence of substantial changes in the Ames test. Exposure concentrations ranged from 0 to 0.943 mM for CEO, 0 to 3.0 mM for EB, and 0 to 0.035 mM for DEB, with the upper exposure concentrations dictated by cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity, measured as a reduction in the proportion of binucleated cells and altered cell morphology, was observed for CEO at concentrations > or =0.175 mM. Exposure to EB led to a reduced proportion of binucleated cells at concentrations > or =2.0 mM, and cell death was observed after DEB exposure at concentrations > or =0.025 mM. No clastogenicity was observed in the V79 cells when tested up to cytotoxic concentrations of CEO, whereas an elevated frequency of micronuclei was observed after exposure to either EB (> or =1.0 mM) or DEB (> or =0.0125 mM). These results suggest that CEO-induced mutagenicity, but not clastogenicity, may contribute to the observed beta-chloroprene-induced carcinogenicity in the rodent bioassay studies.",Is EB mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
40,"Tetrandrine has been used for the treatment of silicosis in China. The potential genotoxic and carcinogenic hazards of this drug were studied using the Salmonella/histidine reversion assay and the SOS/Umu test. The results show that tetrandrine was weakly mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium TA98 with metabolic activation and did not induce SOS response. However, tetrandrine increased the mutagenic activity of benzo[alpha]pyrene, trinitrofluorenone (TNF), 2-aminoanthracene (2AA), diesel emission particles, airborne particles, and cigarette smoke condensate by more than 100%; the activity of aflatoxin B1 and fried beef was increased by over 75%. It also increased the 2AA and TNF-induced SOS response by more than 300%. These results indicated that tetrandrine was a weak promutagen inducing frameshift mutations and was a potent genotoxic enhancer. The mechanism for the genotoxic enhancement is not known. However, the fact that the increase in mutagenicity was noted only in TA98 and not in TA1538 suggested that the enhancement of genotoxicity by tetrandrine may result from an increase in error-prone DNA repair.",Is Tetrandrine mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
41,"Hydroxytyrosol (HT) is an olive-derived phenol endowed with several biological activities, some of which demonstrated in humans. Indeed, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) allows the health claim that HT (≥5mg/d) ""protects LDL particles from oxidative damage"". In terms of safety, HT has been investigated as the predominant part of raw olive mill waste water extracts that have been granted the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status. Also, a long-term toxicological study of HT proposed a NOAEL of 500mg/kg/d. As several HT-containing supplements and functional foods are entering the market, we sought to investigate the genotoxic and mutagenic potential of HT, using well-established in vitro models, i.e. the chromosomal aberration assay and the Ames test (by using the Salmonella typhimurium TA 100, TA98, TA1535, and TA1537 strains and Escherichia coli WP2(pKM101)), with and without S9-induced metabolic activation). Even though we cannot rule out that prolonged exposure to HT and its metabolites might have untoward effects, the results of this study indicate that HT is non-genotoxic and non-mutagenic at concentrations that far exceed those attainable after intake.

42,"Estrogens are indicated as being the most important etiological factors for the development and progression of breast cancer. The implication of estrogen in breast cancer has been associated mostly with the estrogen receptors that mediate cell proliferation. Evidence also exists to support the hypothesis of a direct role of estrogens as tumor initiators. However, the role of estrogen genotoxicity in breast cancer is still questionable. In this study the genotoxic activity of catecholestrogens and 16alpha-hydroxy estrone has been investigated by performing Salmonella strain TA98 and TA100 Ames tests, sister chromatide exchange assays (SCE) and micronucleus assays on human peripheral lymphocytes (CBMN and ARA/CBMN). We found a lack of positive results with micronucleus assays, except for 2-hydroxy estradiol (2-OHE(2)), which shows a peculiar ""bell shaped"" trend of micronucleus number versus concentrations. SCE assay suggests weak genotoxic activity of all tested catechol metabolites, except 4-hydroxy estrone (4-OHE(1)), which also showed negative results by ARA/CBMN. In this open debate, our results support the hypothesis of a weak genotoxicity, not correlated with the carcinogenetic potential of estrogens.",Is estradiol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
43,"The mutagenic potential of three alkyl 2-cyanoacrylate adhesives, three commercial alkyl 2-cyanoacrylate adhesives and three methyl 2-cyano-3-phenylacrylates, was assessed using the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay. Compounds were tested with and without Aroclor 1254-induced rat-liver homogenate (S9 mix). The methyl 2-cyanoacrylate adhesives were mutagenic in the standard plate test with S. typhimurium strain TA100 with and without S9 activation. Methyl 2-cyano-3-(2-bromophenyl)acrylate revealed a direct mutagenic action to S. typhimurium strain TA1535. The compounds most toxic towards the bacterium S. typhimurium, were the methyl 2-cyanoacrylate adhesives (greater than 500 micrograms/plate). All alkyl 2-cyanoacrylate adhesives were tested in a modified spot test for volatile compounds with tester strain TA100. Mutagenic and toxic effects were observed with the three methyl 2-cyanoacrylate adhesives. It can be concluded from the results that the bacterial toxicity and mutagenicity of methyl 2-cyanoacrylate adhesives may be due to the methyl 2-cyanoacrylate monomer.",Is Methyl 2-cyano-3-(2-bromophenyl)acrylate mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
44,"A bacterial photomutagenicity test system has been established according to a predetermined protocol using a light source emitting multiple wave lengths, including UV-A and UV-B, and the tester strains used for standard bacterial mutagenicity testing. 8-Methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) was used as a photomutagenic positive control showing no mutagenicity in the absence of light and borderline (Salmonella typhimurium TA1537) or clear (Salmonella typhimurium TA102 and Escherichia coli WP2) mutagenic effects in the presence of light. Using the same experimental conditions, the UV filters p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), octyl dimethyl PABA (Eusolex 6007), and 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (Eusolex 6300) were non-mutagenic (in the absence of light) and non-photomutagenic (in the presence of light). Dihydroxyacetone (DHA), used as an active ingredient in self-tanning lotions, slightly increased the number of revertants in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA102 in the absence of light. However, the relevance of these effects is equivocal, since they occurred at very high, cytotoxic concentrations (5000 micrograms/plate). Furthermore, these increases were not potentiated by light, thus demonstrating the non-photomutagenicity of DHA. In contrast, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), which is non-mutagenic per se and is activated by external metabolizing systems (e.g., S9-mix) in the absence of light, was clearly mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA1537 in the presence of light (and the absence of S9-mix). Although the photomutagenic potency of DMBA, on a molar basis, was certainly lower than that of 8-MOP, the absolute mutagenic effects of DMBA in the respective bacterial strains were in a similar range under either S9-mix or photoactivation conditions. The strain specificity of the mutagenic effects were, however, different for either enzyme- or light-mediated mutagenicity. This indicates that different reactive intermediates are responsible for the mutagenicity in the tests using the two different activation systems. These results further suggest to use DMBA as a positive photomutagenic control compound alternatively to 8-MOP, since the latter is non- or only weakly photomutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA1537. Furthermore, the usefulness and application of this photomutagenicity test system could be demonstrated for the testing of different photoabsorbing chemicals and cosmetic ingredients.",Is PABA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 or TA1537 strain?,False

46,"A bacterial mutagenesis assay and genetic differences in microsomal CO-binding cytochromes were combined in vitro to evaluate the metabolic activation of several known carcinogens to frameshift mutagens. With the use of liver fractions from C57BL/6N and DBA/2N control mice and mice treated in vivo with 3-methylcholanthrene, beta-naphthoglavone, phenobarbital, or 2,3,7,,-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, the in vitro mutagenicity of 3-methylcholanthrene, 6-aminochrysene, and 2-acetylaminofluorene --but not benzo[a]pyrene==is closely associated with the genetically mediated difference in both aromatic hydrocarbon-inducible aryl hydrocarbon (benzo[a]pyrene) hydroxylase activity and new cytochrome P1-450 formation; such an association between 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene or benz[a]anthracene activation to mutagens in vitro and these genetic differences between C57BL/6N and DBA/2N mouse strains in uncertain. The Salmonella typhimurium histidine mutant TA1538 is more effective than tester strains TA1537 and TA1535 in the determination of 3-methylcholanthrene mutagenesis in vitro. The relationships between the histidine revertant rate as a function of both liver protein concentration per plate and mutagen concentration per plate are illustrated for 3-methylcholanthrene, benzo[a]pyrene, 6-aminochrysene, and 2-acetylaminofluorene. With the use of offspring from the appropriate genetic crosses, the aromatic hydrocarbon-inducible hydroxylase activity appears to be expressed as an autosomal dominant trait, whereas the mutagenesis of 3-methylcholanthrene in vitro appears to be expressed additively; this apparent discrepancy probably reflects different proportional amounts of phenolic benzo[a]pyrene, compared with mutagenic 3-methylcholanthrene metabolites, formed by the monooxygenase(s). 3-Methylcholanthrene, 6-aminochrysene, and 2-acetylaminofluorene--but not benzo[a]pyrene--are each more mutagenic in vitro per molecule of cytochrome P1-450 than per molecule of CO-binding cytochrome other than P1450. Diethylmaleate, a compound which depletes flutathione content in liver, and 1,1,1-trichloropropene-2,3-epoxide, an inhibitor of epoxide hydrase (EC 4.2.1.63), were also studied in vitro. Diethylmaleate, and especially 1,1,1-trichloropropene-2,3-epoxide, increases the mutagenicity of benzo[a]pyrene, whereas no increases occur with 3-methylcholanthrene, 6-aminochrysene, or 2-acetylaminofluorene activation to mutagens in vitro. Both diethylmaleate and 1,1,1-trichloropropene-2,3-epoxide cause decreases in 2-acetylaminofluorene mutagenesis in vitro when liver fractions from phenobarbital-treated mice are used.",Is 3-Methylcholanthrene mutagenic for TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True

The use of MC-induced guinea pig liver S9 is particularly valuable for detecting the weak mutagenicity of benz[c]acridine, which is barely positive in a standard Ames assay. However, anthracene and phenanthrene, which are generally considered not to be carcinogens, remain non-mutagenic for strain TA100. This enhancement of mutagenicity does not correlate with arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase activities of the various liver preparations and does not apply to certain other non-PAH mutagens, including beta-naphthylamine, aflatoxin B1 and 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene.",Is MC mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
48,"Nitroscanate (NSC) was found to be a direct acting mutagen in the Ames Salmonella tester strains TA100 and TA98 and this activity increased further in the presence of rat liver S9 mix. It was inactive in TA98NR and TA100NR, and weakly active in TA98/1,8-DNP6. A substantial fall in drug induced mutagenicity by pentachlorophenol, an inhibitor of acetyltransferase, in TA98, TA100 and YG1024 suggests the initial bioconversion of a nitro group to hydroxylamine and its further activation to the ultimate N-acetoxyarylamine. The refrigerated DMSO solution of the drug in the plate incorporation assay and freshly prepared solutions using the pre-incubation procedure indicated a fall in mutagenicity owing to the conversion of NSC to N,N'-bis-4-(p-nitrophenoxy)phenyl thiourea (NFPT). The drastic reduction in mutagenicity in the presence of 4-amino-4'-nitrodiphenyl ether (ANDE) and 4-aminodiphenyl ether (ADE) was also attributed to the conversion of NSC to the corresponding thiourea, a non-mutagen. The negligible mutagenicity of ANDE and its absence in ADE and 4-isothiocyanate diphenyl ether (ITDE) suggests that the mutagenicity of NSC is due to the nitro group, and the -NCS function is responsible for enhanced mutagenicity over nor-isothiocyanate 4-nitrodiphenyl ether (NDE).",Is Nitroscanate mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
49,"Cyclohexanone oxime is used primarily as a captive intermediate in the synthesis of caprolactam for the production of polycaprolactam (Nylon-6) fibers and plastics and also in a variety of industrial applications. Cyclohexanone oxime was selected for study because of the potential for human exposure and the interest in oximes as a chemical class. Toxicity studies of cyclohexanone oxime (approximately 99% pure) were carried out in male and female B6C3F1 mice; the compound was administered in drinking water for 2 weeks or 13 weeks. In addition, the genetic toxicity of cyclohexanone oxime was evaluated by determining mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium and induction of chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells in vitro, with and without S9 activation. The frequency of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of mice from the 13-week study was also determined. In the 2-week study, groups of five male and five female mice were given drinking water containing 0, 106, 312, 625, 1,250, or 2,500 ppm cyclohexanone oxime. No deaths occurred, and there was no decrease in weight gain in any group. No gross lesions were observed; there were significant increases in relative spleen weights of males and females in the 2,500 ppm group and increases in the relative liver weight of male mice exposed to 312 ppm or greater. In the 13-week studies, groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were given drinking water containing 625, 1,250, 2,500, 5,000 or 10,000 ppm cyclohexanone oxime. Deaths occurred in the 10,000 ppm groups and weight gain was depressed in males and females given 10,000 ppm and in females given 5,000 ppm. There were significant increases in relative spleen weight at exposure levels of 5,000 and 10,000 ppm and significant increases in the relative liver weights of males and females that received 10,000 ppm. Microscopically, hematopoietic cell proliferation was observed in the spleen of males and females in the 5,000 and 10,000 ppm groups. Centrilobular cell hypertrophy was observed in the liver of males in the 2,500, 5,000, and 10,000 ppm groups and in females in the 5,000 and 10,000 ppm groups. Olfactory epithelial degeneration was observed in all exposed groups. Cyclohexanone oxime was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535 with S9 activation only; results of mutagenicity testing of cyclohexanone oxime were negative in strains TA97, TA98, and TA100, with and without S9. Cyclohexanone oxime gave equivocal results in a test for induction of chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells without S9; with S9, results were negative. In vivo, no induction of micronuclei was noted in erythrocytes of mice treated with cyclohexanone oxime either for 13 weeks in drinking water or for 3 days by intraperitoneal injection. In summary, the major targets of cyclohexanone oxime toxicity are the erythrocyte, spleen, liver, and nasal epithelium. The no-effect level for erythrotoxicity is 2,500 ppm following 13 weeks of exposure. The no-effect level for hematopoietic cell proliferation in the spleen is 2,500 ppm. The no-effect level for hepatotoxicity is 1,250 ppm for males and 2,500 ppm for females following 13 weeks of exposure. Some nasal olfactory epithelial degeneration was observed at all exposure levels; only at 625 ppm in males was the incidence of this lesion not significantly different from that in the controls.

The newly developed strain S.typhimurium NM5004, was found to have 52-fold greater GST activity than the original umu strain S.typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. We compared sensitivities of these two tester strains, NM5004 and TA1535/pSK1002, for induction of umuC gene expression with several dihaloalkanes which are activated or inactivated by GST 5-5 activity. The induction of umuC gene expression by these chemicals was monitored by measuring the cellular beta-galactosidase activity produced by umuC""lacZ fusion gene in these two tester strains. Ethylene dibromide, 1-bromo-2-chloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and methylene dichloride induced umuC gene expression more strongly in the NM5004 strain than the original strain. 4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine were found to induce umuC gene expression to similar extents in both strains. In the case of 1-nitropyrene and 2-nitrofluorene, however, NM5004 strain showed weaker umuC gene expression responses than the original TA1535/pSK1002 strain. 1,2-Epoxy-3-(4'-nitrophenoxy)propane, a known substrate for GST 5-5, was found to inhibit umuC induction caused by 1-bromo-2-chloroethane.

51,"beta-Ionone (BIO) is a degraded (C(13)) sesquiterpenoid compound found in a variety of edible and aromatic plants. BIO and other ionone derivatives have been used in fragrance products and as flavoring food additives. In this study we investigated the mutagenic and antimutagenic activities of BIO using the Salmonella/microsome assay. Mutagenicity was evaluated by two tests with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA98, TA97a and TA1535, without and with addition of S9 mixture. A first assay was performed by the plate incorporation procedure and a confirmation test by the pre-incubation method. In either test, no increase in the number of his(+) revertant colonies over the negative (solvent) control values was noted with any of the four tester strains thereby indicating that BIO was not genotoxic in the Salmonella assay. Antimutagenic activity was investigated by testing (by the plate incorporation method) different non-toxic doses of BIO against one or more non-toxic doses of direct-acting (sodium azide: SA, 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide: 4-NQNO, 2-nitrofluorene: 2-NF and nitro-o-phenylenediamine: NPD) as well as indirect-acting (cyclophosphamide: CP, benzo[a]pyrene: B[a]P, aflatoxin B1: AFB1, 2-aminoanthracene: 2-AA, and 2-aminofluorene: 2-AF) mutagens. BIO did not alter the effects of any direct-acting mutagen or B[a]P and 2-AF. Mutagenic effects of AFB1 and CP, however, were markedly and dose-dependently antagonized by BIO. It has been reported that, in the rat liver, activation of B[a]P and 2-AF depend on CYP1A1 activity, and that CYP2B subfamily is involved in the metabolic activation of CP and AFB1. It has also been described that BIO is a potent inhibitor of CYP2B1/2 and a weaker inhibitor of CYP1A1. Therefore, antagonism of CP-and AFB1-induced mutagenic effects by BIO could have been mediated-at least in part-by the inhibition of CYP2B enzymes.",Is beta-Ionone mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
52,"2-Methoxy-4-nitroaniline (MNA), an intermediate in the synthesis of azo dyes used in textiles and paints, is structurally similar to carcinogenic anilines. Human exposure occurs primarily in the occupational setting through handling of dye dust, and through use and disposal of MNA-containing products. MNA has been reported to induce contact hypersensitivity in a human, myocardial necrosis in rats, and bacterial mutagenicity. This study assessed the subacute toxicity, genotoxicity, contact hypersensitivity, and reproductive toxicity of MNA in rodents in an effort to more fully characterize its toxicological profile. B6C3F1/N mice were exposed to 0, 650, 1250, 2500, 5000, or 10,000 ppm MNA by dosed feed for 14-days to evaluate subacute toxicity and histopathological endpoints. In female mice, decreased body weight (13.5 %) and absolute kidney weight (14.8 %), compared to control, were observed at 10,000 ppm MNA; increased relative liver weight (10-12 %), compared to control, occurred at 5,000-10,000 ppm MNA. In male mice, absolute (15 %) and relative liver weights (9-13 %) were increased at 2,500-5,000 ppm and 1250-10,000 ppm MNA, compared to control, respectively. In both sexes of mice, minimal elevations of hemosiderin pigmentation (a breakdown product of erythrocytes), relative to control, were observed in the liver (10,000 ppm); minimal to moderate elevations of hemosiderin pigmentation (5,000-10,000 ppm) and minimal increases in hematopoietic cell proliferation occurred in the spleen (≥ 1250 ppm). In a reproductive toxicity study, timed-mated female Harlan Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to 0-10,000 ppm MNA by dosed feed from gestation day 6 through postnatal day (PND) 21. Decreases in mean litter weights were observed at 5000 ppm MNA, compared to control, beginning at PND1. To evaluate potential contact hypersensitivity, MNA (2.5-50 %, in dimethylformamide) was applied to the dorsa of both ears of female Balb/c mice once daily for three days. The increase observed in lymph node cell proliferation (10-50 % increase in thymidine uptake compared to control) did not reproducibly achieve the Sensitization Index (SI) 3 level, and there was no ear swelling evident following sensitization with 10-50 % MNA and challenge with 25 % MNA in the mouse ear swelling test. In bacterial mutagenicity assays, MNA (250-1000 μg/plate) induced significant increases, compared to control, in mutant colonies with and without metabolic activation enzymes in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA98. These data indicate that MNA is genotoxic, and may induce erythrocyte damage and reactive phagocytosis by macrophages in the liver and spleen.",Is 2-Methoxy-4-nitroaniline mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
53,"To clarify the mutagenic potential of surface soil in residential areas in Kyoto city, surface soil samples were collected twice or three times from 12 sites, and their organic extracts were examined by the Ames/Salmonella assay. Almost all (>92%) samples showed mutagenicity in TA98 without and with S9 mix, and 8/25 (32%) samples showed high (1000-10,000 revertants/g of soil) or extreme (>10,000 revertants/g of soil) activity. Moreover, to identify the major mutagens in surface soil in Kyoto, a soil sample was collected at a site where soil contamination with mutagens was severe and continual. The soil extract, which showed potent mutagenicity in TA98 without S9 mix, was fractionated by diverse column chromatography methods. Five major mutagenic constituents were isolated and identified to be 1,6-dinitropyrene (DNP), 1,8-DNP, 1,3,6-trinitropyrene (TNP), 3,9-dinitrofluoranthene (DNF), and 3,6-dinitrobenzo[e]pyrene (DNBeP) by co-chromatography using high performance liquid chromatography and spectral analysis. Contribution ratios of 1,6-DNP, 1,8-DNP, 1,3,6-TNP, 3,9-DNF, and 3,6-DNBeP to total mutagenicity of the soil extract in TA98 without S9 mix were 3, 10, 10, 10, and 6%, respectively. These nitroarenes were detected in surface soil samples collected from four different residential sites in other prefectures, and their contribution ratios to soil mutagenicity were from 0.7 to 22%. These results suggest that surface soil in residential areas in Kyoto was widely contaminated with mutagens and there were some sites where surface soils were heavily polluted. 1,6-DNP, 1,8-DNP, 1,3,6-TNP, 3,9-DNF, and 3,6-DNBeP may be major mutagenic constituents that contaminate surface soil in Kyoto and other residential areas.",Is DNP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
54,"We previously identified 1,3-, 1,6-, and 1,8-dinitropyrene (DNP) isomers as major mutagens in surface soil in three metropolitan areas of Japan. In the present study, an organic extract from surface soil collected at a park in Takatsuki in Osaka Prefecture, which showed extremely high mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the absence of mammalian metabolic system (S9 mix), was investigated to identify major mutagens. A new powerful bacterial mutagen, as well as 1,6- and 1,8-DNP isomers, was isolated from the organic extract (1.8 g) of the soil sample (2.2 kg) by column chromatography. On the basis of mass spectra, the new mutagen, which accounted for 15% of the total mutagenicity of the soil extract, was thought to be a dinitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a molecular weight of m/z 342. The mutagen was synthesized from benzo[e]pyrene by nitration and was determined to be 3,6-dinitrobenzo[e]pyrene (DNBeP) based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The mutagenic potency of 3,6-DNBeP in the Ames/Salmonella assay was extremely high, in that it induced 285,000 revertants/nmol in TA98 and 955,000 revertants/nmol in YG1024 without S9 mix and was comparable to those of DNP isomers, which are some the most potent bacterial mutagens reported so far. In addition to the soil sample from Takatsuki, 3,6-DNBeP was also detected in surface soil samples collected at parks in four different cities, i.e., Izumiotsu and Takaishi in Osaka Prefecture and Nagoya and Hekinan in Aichi Prefecture, and accounted for 22-29% of the total mutagenicity of these soil extracts in TA98 without S9 mix. These results suggest that 3,6-DNBeP is a major mutagen in surface soil and may largely contaminate the surface soil in these two regions in Japan.",Is DNP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
55,"To clarify the mutagenic potential of surface soil in the Kinki region of Japan, particularly in Osaka and neighboring cities, 62 surface soil samples were collected and their organic extracts were examined by the Ames/Salmonella assay. All of the samples were mutagenic toward TA98 in both the presence and absence of a mammalian metabolic activation system (S9 mix). While all of the samples showed mutagenicity toward TA100 with S9 mix, only 45/62 (73%) were mutagenic without S9 mix. Fifty (81%) of the samples showed higher activity toward TA98 than TA100. The mean values of the mutagenicities of soil samples collected in Osaka prefecture (n=35) toward TA98 with and without S9 mix were 2315 and 1630 revertants per gram of soil, respectively, and these were 2.9 and 2.6 times as high as the values for samples from other prefectures (n=27), respectively. Three dinitropyrene (DNP) isomers, i.e. 1,3-, 1,6- and 1,8-DNP, and 3-nitrobenzanthrone (NBA) in the surface soil samples were quantified by fluorometric detection of the corresponding amino compounds, i.e. diaminopyrene isomers and 3-aminobenzanthrone, using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The three DNP isomers were detected in all of the soil samples (n=26) that were mainly collected in Osaka prefecture, and the amounts of 1,3-, 1,6- and 1,8-DNP were 6-1526, 11-1772 and 10-2092pg/g of soil, respectively. The contribution ratios of 1,3-, 1,6- and 1,8-DNP to the mutagenicity of soil extracts toward TA98 without S9 mix were 0.2-12, 0.3-12 and 0.5-27%, respectively. The amount of 3-NBA in soil samples (n=8) was 144-1158pg/g of soil, and the contribution ratio of 3-NBA to the mutagenicity of soil extracts was 2-38%. These results suggest that the surface soils in the Kinki region were highly polluted with mutagens and the pollution levels in Osaka prefecture were higher than those in other areas. DNP isomers and 3-NBA may be major mutagens that contaminate surface soil in this region.",Is DNP mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
56,"Distributions of 1,3-dinitropyrene (1,3-DNP), 1,6-DNP, 1,8-DNP, 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) and mutagenicity in airborne particulates collected in downtown Kanazawa, Japan with an Andersen high-volume air sampler were examined. Mutagenicities of benzene-ethanol extract from particulates were determined by the Ames test using S. typhimurium strains without S9 mix, while concentrations of DNPs and 1-NP were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using chemiluminescence detection. In the finest particulate fraction (smaller than 1.1 microns), 68% and 75% of the total mutagenicities were observed in TA98 and YG1024 strains, respectively. In the same fraction, 65-82% of three DNPs as well as 84% of 1-NP were observed. Mutagenic contributions of 1,3-DNP, 1,6-DNP, 1,8-DNP and 1-NP in the extract were respectively 0.6, 1.2, 1.8 and 1.6% in the TA98 strain, and 2.5, 5, 9 and 2.1% in the YG1024 strain.",Is DNP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
57,"N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) has been reported to decrease genotoxicity induced by several mutagens. In this paper, the desmutagenic effect of NAC on a complex mixture, such as diesel extract, has been analyzed. Studies have been carried out in vitro with the Ames test (reverse mutations on TA98, TA100, and TA104 strains) and sister chromatid exchanges assay (SCE) in human lymphocytes. NAC inhibits diesel genotoxicity in both assays. NAC also inhibits the mutagenicity of 1,8-dinitropyrene (1,8-DNP) and 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) known to be present in diesel exhaust and to be activated by cellular O-transacetylases and nitropyrene reductases. NAC inhibits also the induction of SCE in human lymphocytes by diesel extract. These results, and those obtained by the preincubation of NAC with cells, suggest that the inhibition also takes place inside the cell.",Is DNP mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
58,"Dinitropyrenes (DNP), present in polluted air, are potent direct-acting mutagens in Salmonella typhimurium TA98. This mutagenicity is markedly reduced in the presence of rat-liver S9 or microsomes. This has now been confirmed using mouse hepatic fractions. Since most in vitro test systems do not adequately simulate conditions encountered in the intact animal, we have investigated dinitropyrene mutagenicity to Salmonella in the host-mediated assay. 1,8-Dinitropyrene (1,8-DNP) given p.o. to BALB/c mice induced a weak mutagenic effect in S. typhimurium TA98 recovered from the liver 1 h after i.v. administration (optimum time). Over the entire dose range tested no toxicity to bacterial cells was detected. Mutation induction in vivo was dose-related with maximum response at 1 mg DNP/kg body weight. This optimum dose, however, was non-mutagenic to strains TA98/1,8-DNP6 (O-transacetylase-deficient) or TA98NR/1,8-DNP6 (nitroreductase- and O-transacetylase-deficient). 1,3-Dinitropyrene and 1,6-dinitropyrene were weakly mutagenic to TA98 at doses similar to 1,8-DNP. Studies with [14C]1,8-DNP showed that 1 h after oral dosing (1 mg/kg), over 100 ng of 1,8-DNP equivalents were present in the liver (= 0.73% dose). However, only about 5.5 ng were present in the bacterial pellet, suggesting that hepatic components in vivo, as in vitro, bind to DNP, thus interfering with its interaction with Salmonella.",Is DNP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
59,"The effect of highly purified rat liver cytosolic NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase [EC 1.6.99.2] on the mutagenicity of 1,3- 1,6- and 1,8-dinitropyrene (DNP) was studied in the Ames Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay. NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase over the range of 0.02-0.8 micrograms/plate (38-1500) units increased up to threefold the mutagenicity of all three DNPs in S. typhimurium TA 98. In TA98NR, a strain deficient in ""classical"" nitro-reductase, the mutagenicity of 1,6- and 1,8-DNP was essentially unchanged, whereas that of 1,3-DNP was markedly reduced. NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase enhanced the mutagenicity of 1,6- and 1,8-DNP to approximately equivalent extents in TA98NR and TA98. The mutagenicity of 1,3-DNP in TA98NR was potently enhanced by the addition of NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase in a dose-responsive manner. In the presence of 0.8 micrograms NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase, 1,3-DNP displayed a mutagenic response in TA98NR that was comparable to that obtained in TA98. NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase was found to increase the mutagenicity of 1,6- but not 1,3- or 1,8-DNP to mutagenic intermediates in TA98/1,8-DNP6, a strain deficient in O-acetyltransferase activity. The results suggest that NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase not only catalyzes reduction of the parent DNP but also that of partially reduced metabolites generated from that DNP. Such reductive metabolism may lead to increased formation of the penultimate mutagenic species.",Is DNP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
60,"1,8-Dinitropyrene (DNP) is a potent, direct-acting mutagen to Salmonella typhimurium TA98 due to activation by bacterial metabolism. We have studied the effects of uninduced and Aroclor-induced rodent liver post-mitochondrial supernatant (S9), microsomes or cytosolic preparations on its activity. With the plate incorporation protocol, the reported S9-mediated inhibition of mutagenicity was confirmed and shown to be greater after induction when equivalent levels of protein were plated. Cytosol increased mutagenicity considerably whereas the inhibitory effect of S9 could be attributed to the microsomal fraction. The activating and detoxifying capacities of the various hepatic fractions derived from male Sprague-Dawley rats and female BALB/c mice were similar. In the absence of hepatic preparations, DNP mutagenicity was much lower in TA98/1,8DNP6 (deficient in transacetylase) than in TA98, although mutagenic activity could be still increased in the former strain by addition of uninduced cytosol. When DNP was pre-incubated in a liquid assay with S9 before addition of TA98, inhibition occurred and was time dependent. Thus the overall detoxifying effect of S9 is independent of bacterial metabolism. Furthermore, inhibition occurred under conditions where cytosol and microsomal components of S9 were kept together, indicating that the detoxifying effect of the microsomes predominates. The data therefore suggest that the microsomal-mediated detoxification by S9 may be due to the presence of an inhibitory component, enzymatic or otherwise, whose concentration is increased after Aroclor-induction. Nitro-reductase activities detected in TA98 and TA98/1,8-DNP6 were 10-fold higher than those in the mammalian fractions, although the activities in the latter increased to the bacterial enzyme levels after incubation of induced S9 or microsomes, but not cytosol, with an NADPH-generating system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Is DNP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
61,"By renitrating 3-nitrofluoranthene in the presence of fuming nitric acid, some additional nitro-derivatives were induced; they were identified as 3,7-, 3,9- and 3,4-dinitrofluoranthene (DNF), and two trinitrofluoranthenes (TNF, 3,4,7- and 3,4,8- or 3,4,9-isomers) on the basis of the results of mass spectrometry and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance.

62,"Salmonella typhimurium tester strain TA98/1,8-DNP6 is resistant to the mutagenicity of 1,8-dinitropyrene because it lacks an esterification enzyme which is needed for the formation of the ultimate mutagen, presumably the corresponding hydroxamic acid ester. This enzyme does not appear to be required for the activation of all nitroarenes and arylamines, as some of these are fully active in TA98/1,8-DNP. It is suggested that these form electrophilic arylnitrenium ions nonenzymatically from nitroso- and N-hydroxylamino-arenes intermediates. The esterification enzyme appears to be a transacetylase. An assay using 2-aminofluorene as the acetyl acceptor is described.

67,"The combination of chemical analyses and bioassays allows the identification of potentially mutagenic compounds in different types of samples. Dyes can be considered as emergent contaminants and were detected in waters, under the influence of textile activities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of 9 azo dyes to the mutagenicity of representative environmental samples. Samples were collected along one year in the largest conglomerate of textile industries of Brazil. We analyzed water samples from an important water body, Piracicaba River, upstream and downstream two main discharges, the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the tributary Quilombo River, which receives untreated effluent from local industries. Samples were analyzed using a LC-MS/MS and tested for mutagenicity in the Salmonella/microsome microsuspension assay with TA98 and YG1041. Six dyes were detected in the collected samples, Disperse Blue 291, Disperse Blue 373, Disperse Orange 30, Disperse Red 1, Disperse Violet 93, and Disperse Yellow 3. The most sensitive condition for the detection of the mutagenicity was the strain YG1041 with S9. The concentration of dyes and mutagenicity levels varied along time and the dry season represented the worst condition. Disperse Blue 373 and Disperse Violet 93 were the major contributors to the mutagenicity. We conclude that dyes are contributing for the mutagenicity of Piracicaba River water; and both discharges, WWTP effluent and Quilombo River, increase the mutagenicity of Piracicaba River waters in about 10-fold. The combination of chemical analysis and bioassays were key in the identification the main drivers of the water mutagenicity and allows the selection of priority compounds to be included in monitoring programs as well for the enforcing actions required to protect the water quality for multiple uses.",Is Disperse Yellow 3 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

In this study, we selected 13 main DBPs found in drinking water to quantitatively analyse their cytotoxicity and genotoxicity using a microplate-based cytotoxicity assay and a developed SOS/umu assay in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. With the developed SOS/umu test, eight DBPs: 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2[5H]-fura3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2-[5H]-furanone (MX), dibromoacetonitrile (DBN), iodoacetic acid (IA), bromochloroacetonitrile (BCN), bromoacetic acid (BA), trichloroacetonitrile (TCN), dibromoacetic acid (DBA) and dichloroacetic acid (DCA) were significantly genotoxic to S. typhimurium. Three DBPs: chloroacetic acid (CA), trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and dichloroacetonitrile (DCN) were weakly genotoxic, whereas the remaining DBPs: chloroacetonitrile (CN) and chloral hydrate (CH) were negative. The rank order in decreasing genotoxicity was as follows: MX > DBN > IA > BCN > BA > TCN > DBA > DCA > CA, TCA, DCN > CN, CH. MX was approximately 370 000 times more genotoxic than DCA. In the microplate-based cytotoxicity assay, cytotoxic potencies of the 13 DBPs were compared and ranked in decreasing order as follows: MX > IA > DBN > BCN > BA > TCN > DCN > CA > DCA > DBA > CN > TCA > CH. MX was approximately 19 200 times more cytotoxic than CH. A statistically significant correlation was found between cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the 13 DBPs in S. typhimurium.

69,"The metabolism and mutagenicity of the esophageal carcinogen N-nitroso-N-methylaniline (NMA) was studied using hepatic and esophageal 9000 X g supernatant (S-9) preparations from Sprague-Dawley rats induced with pyrazole and phenobarbital. Only pyrazole-induced hepatic S-9 was able to dose-dependently activate NMA to a mutagen in the Ames assay and specifically in Salmonella typhimurium TA1537. NMA in the presence of phenobarbital-induced S-9 gave a very weak non-dose dependent mutagenic response. Metabolism of NMA by the two induced hepatic and esophageal S-9 fractions yielded aniline and N-methylaniline (MA). Phenobarbital-induced S-9 from both tissues also afforded phenol, while none was found with the pyrazole-induced preparations. Phenol formation presumably arose from the direct oxidative demethylation of NMA via a benzenediazonium ion (BDI) intermediate. The results indicate that an important metabolic pathway for NMA, with both inducing agents, entails an initial denitrosation to yield MA, which in turn rapidly undergoes oxidative demethylation to aniline. The conversion of NMA to phenol also suggests that direct demethylation of NMA in the phenobarbital-induced system is an important metabolic pathway.",Is NMA mutagenic for TA1537 strain?,True

A preincubation modification of the assay was also performed, using strains TA98 and TA104. Mutagenic activity was not observed for NMP, while N-MeGABA showed significant responses with TA104 but dose-related mutagenicity was not established. Preincubation testing revealed both NMP and N-MeGABA to be cytotoxic to the test population of Salmonella at the highest treatment doses.",Is NMP mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
73,"River sediments may contain a huge variety of environmental contaminants and play a key role in the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems. Contaminants adsorbed to sediments and suspended solids may contribute directly or after remobilization to an adverse ecological and chemical status of surface water. In this subproject of the joint research project DanTox, acetonic Soxhlet extracts from three German river sediments from the River Rhine (Altrip and Ehrenbreitstein with moderate contamination) and River Elbe (Veringkanal Hamburg heavily contaminated) were prepared and redissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). These extracts were analyzed with a standard bioassay battery with organisms from different trophic levels (bacteria, algae, Daphnia, fish) as well as in the Ames test and the umuC test for bacterial mutagenicity and genotoxicity according to the respective OECD and ISO guidelines. In total, 0.01% (standard) up to 0.25% (only fish embryo test) of the DMSO sediment extract was dosed to the test systems resulting in maximum sediment equivalent concentrations (SEQ) of 2 up to 50 g l(-1). The sediment of Veringkanal near Hamburg harbor was significantly more toxic in most tests compared to the sediment extracts from Altrip and Ehrenbreitstein from the River Rhine. The most toxic effect found for Veringkanal was in the algae test with an ErC50 (72 h) of 0.00226 g l(-1) SEQ. Ehrenbreitstein and Altrip samples were about factor 1,000 less toxic. In the Daphnia, Lemna, and acute fish toxicity tests, no toxicity at all was found at 2 g l(-1) SEQ. corresponding to 0.01% DMSO. Only when increasing the DMSO concentration the fish embryo test showed a 22-fold higher toxicity for Veringkanal than for Ehrenbreitstein and Altrip samples, while the toxicity difference was less evident for the Daphnia test due to the overlaying solvent toxicity above 0.05% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The higher toxicities observed with the Veringkanal sample are supported by the PAH and PCB concentrations analyzed in the sediments. The sediment extracts of Altrip and Veringkanal were mutagenic in the Ames tester strain TA98 with metabolic activation (S9-mix). The findings allow a better ecotoxicological characterization of the sediments extensively analyzed in all subprojects of the DanTox project (e.g., Garcia-Kaeufer et al.

74,"2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5',6,6'-Decachlorobiphenyl (PCB 209) is a fully chlorinated, non-coplanar biphenyl. To demonstrate that PCB 209 is not likely to exhibit human health hazards common to coplanar PCBs it was tested for cytochrome P450 (P450) enzyme induction potentials, genetic toxicity, and endocrine-modulating activity. PCB 209 (dose from 0.005 to 5000 ng/mL) did not significantly induce P450 CYP1A, 2A, 2B, 3A, or 4A enzyme activities in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. In contrast, Aroclor 1260, a PCB mixture that contains approximately 60% chlorine by weight, showed significant induction of P450 CYP1A, 2A, 2B, and 3A within the same dose range. PCB 209 (dose from 100 to 5000 microg/plate) was negative in the bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) test in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537 or in Eschericia coli strain WP2uvrA. PCB 209 (dose from 25 to 150 microg/mL) was also negative for forward mutations at the thymidine kinase (TK+/-) locus of L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells. The Ames and the mouse lymphoma assays were both conducted in the absence and presence of rat liver S9 fraction. PCB 209 (dose from 500 to 2000 mg/kg by single dose oral gavage) did not induce an increase in the frequency of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes in mouse bone marrow in vivo. PCB 209 did not induce estrogenic effects when administered by gavage to ovariectomized adult female rats at 500 and 1000 mg/kg for 4 days, nor did it produce alterations consistent with endocrine-modulating activity in adult intact male rats when administered by gavage at 500 and 1000 mg/kg for 15 consecutive days.",Is PCB mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or WP2uvrA or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
75,"The activation mechanism of emodin, a fungal anthraquinone and constituent of rhubarb, into a direct mutagen to Salmonella typhimurium TA1537 was investigated by using the S9 and microsomes of rat livers. Upon incubating emodin with the hepatic S9 derived from PCB-pretreated rats, this anthraquinone exhibited mutagenicity in the presence of NADPH or NADH, and this enzymatic activation, maximal at pH 7.0 and occurring in the microsomes, was induced by the pretreatment of rats with PCB, 3-methyl-cholanthrene or phenobarbital and was inhibited by alpha-naphthoflavone, SKF 525A and carbon monoxide. Thin-layer chromatographic analysis revealed that emodin was biotransformed by the microsomal enzymes into at least 5 quinonoid metabolites, among which one pigment, identified as 2-hydroxyemodin (1,2,3,8-tetrahydroxy-6-methyl-anthraquinone), was proved to be a direct mutagen to the test strain, and the remaining 4 quinoniod metabolites were negative or far less active than this active principle.",Is PCB mutagenic for TA1537 strain?,True

77,"Several pharmaceutical drugs show strong hepatotoxicity during therapeutic use. We have studied 6 of them: aminophenazone, clofibrate, nifuroxazide, oxamniquine, perhexiline maleate, tienilic acid. Their mutagenicity was assessed in the Ames test on 6 strains of Salmonella typhimurium, and in V79 Chinese hamster lung cells using a rat-hepatocyte-mediated metabolic activation system and the HGPRT and Na+/K+ ATPase assay. Nifuroxazide was positive in the Ames test in two Salmonella strains (TA100, and TA100 Fr1). In the hepatocyte-mediated mammalian V79 cell system, nifuroxazide, clofibrate and aminophenazone were negative; oxamniquine and tienilic acid were positive with and without metabolic activation in tests looking for ouabain and 6-thioguanine resistance. Perhexiline maleate was negative for the direct induction of 6-thioguanine resistance without metabolic activation, and positive after metabolisation mediated by primary rat's hepatocytes. These results suggest the need for some caution in the use of some pharmaceutical drugs because of hepatotoxicity and because 3 out of 6 drugs were shown to be slightly mutagenic in mammalian cells.",Is Nifuroxazide mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
78,"Although many studies have reported that nitroaromatics such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) have strong mutagenicity, the mechanism of mutagenic activity in these compounds has not yet been reported. We examined the mutagenicity versus reactivity and biodegradation by bacteria using TNT and its analogs (1,3,5-trinitrobenzene [TNB], 2,4,6-trinitroaniline [TNA], 2,4,6-trinitro-phenol [TNP], N,2,4,6-tetranitro-N-methyl-aniline [tetryl], 2,4-dinitrotoluene [24DNT], and 2,6-dinitrotoluene [26DNT]). Aromatic compounds harboring three nitro groups (except TNP) have high mutagenicity, judging from the results of the umu test using luminescent bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535/pTL210). Single-electron reduction potentials for these chemicals were -530, -555, -565, -575, -640, -674, and -764 mV for TNA, tetyl, TNT, TNB, 24DNT, 26DNT, and TNP, respectively, indicating that trinitro-aromatics (except TNP) were more reducible than other compounds. Pseudomonas sp. strain TM15, which was isolated from TNT-contaminated soils in the Yamada Green Zone, Kitakyushu City, Japan, could efficiently biotransform TNT, TNB, TNA, and tetryl; 24DNT, 26DNT, and TNP were less biodegradable. This strain converted all TNT analogs into reduction products; nitro groups were reduced to amino groups. We revealed that the mutagenicity of nitroaromatics correlate with reactivity and biodegradability. This finding may contribute to the elucidation of mutagenic expression of nitroaromatic compounds in organisms.",Is DNT mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
79,"2-Amino-4,6-dinitrobenzoic acid (2-A-4,6-DNBA), 4-amino-2,6-dinitrobenzoic acid (4-A-2,6-DNBA), 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid (2,4,6-TNBA), 2-amino-4, 6-dinitrobenzylalcohol (2-A-4,6-DNBAlc), 4-amino-2,6-dinitrobenzylalcohol (4-A-2,6-DNBAlc), 2,4-dinitrotoluol-5-sulfonic acid (2,4-DNT-5-SA), 2,4-dinitrotoluol-3-sulfonic acid (2,4-DNT-3-SA), and 2, 4-dinitrobenzoic acid (2,4-DNBA) are derivatives of nitro-explosives that have been detected in groundwater close to munitions facilities. In the present study, the genotoxicity of these compounds was evaluated in Salmonella/microsome assays (in strains TA100 and TA98, with and without S9 and in TA98NR without S9), in chromosomal aberration (CA) tests with Chinese hamster fibroblasts (V79), and in micronucleus (MN) assays with human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. All compounds except the sulfonic acids were positive in the bacterial mutagenicity tests, with 2,4,6-TNBA producing the strongest response (8023 revertants/micromol in TA98 without S9 activation). 2-A-4,6-DNBA was a direct acting mutagen in TA98, but negative in TA100. The other positive compounds were approximately 1-3 orders of magnitude less mutagenic than 2,4,6-TNBA in TA98 and in TA100; relatively strong effects ( approximately 50-400 revertants/micromol) were produced by the benzylacohols in the two indicator strains. With the exception of 2,4-DNBA, the mutagenic responses were lower in the nitroreductase-deficient strain TA98NR than in the parental strain. 2,4-DNBA produced a marginally positive response in the V79-cell CA assay; the other substances were devoid of activity. Only the benzoic acids were tested for MN induction in HepG2 cells, and all produced positive responses. As in the bacterial assays, the strongest effect was seen with 2,4,6-TNBA (significant induction at >or=1.9 microM). 4-A-2,6-DNBA was positive at 432 microM; the weakest effect was observed with 2,4,-DNBA (positive at >or=920 microM). The differences in the sensitivity of the indicator cells to these agents can be explained by differences in the activities of enzymes involved in the activation of the compounds. The strong responses produced by some of the compounds in the human-derived cells suggest that environmental exposure to these breakdown products of nitro-explosives may pose a cancer risk in man.",Is DNT mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

A previous publication already reported the mutagenic activities of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and its related hydroxylamine derivatives in this test system. A time course of the mutagenicity during the anaerobic transformation of TNT, 24DNT, and 26DNT was also investigated under the same conditions to compare with the results from the pure compounds. The monohydroxylamino intermediates 2-hydroxylamino-4-nitrotoluene (2HA4NT), 4-hydroxylamino-2-nitrotoluene (4HA2NT) and 2-hydroxylamino-6-nitrotoluene (2HA6NT) formed during anaerobic transformation of dinitrotoluenes were proven to be mutagenic in the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA100. This study reports that 4HA2NT is the most stable derivative, whereas 2HA4NT and 2HA6NT are less stable and these intermediates are mutagenic in the Ames test. Both 24DNT and 26DNT and their final metabolites 2,4-diaminotoluene (24DAT) and 2,6-aminotoluene (26DAT) appeared nonmutagenic. In a time-course study of TNT degradation, the temporal sample containing 85% of 2,4-dihydroxylamino-6-nitrotoluene (24HA6NT) is most mutagenic. These observations suggest that the bioremediation approach for treatment of 24DNT and 26DNT should be carried past the hydroxylamino intermediate.",Is DNT mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True

In group 3 consisting of 28 agents used in chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries but not yet tested for mutagenicity and for the carcinogenicity of which no conclusive data are available, seven appeared to be mutagens (1-aminoanthraquinone, 2-aminoanthraquinone, 1-amino-4-chloranthraquinone, based blue, dinitrochlorbenzene, nitrosodiphenylamine and 2,3,5-trinitronaphthalene).",Is DDT mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
94,"A total of 228 pesticides (88 insecticides, 60 fungicides, 62 herbicides, 12 plant-growth regulators, 3 metabolites and 3 other compounds) was tested for mutagenicity in bacterial reversion-assay systems with 5 strains (TA100, TA98, TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538) of Salmonella typhimurium and a strain (WP2 hcr) of Escherichia coli. 50 pesticides (25 insecticides, 20 fungicides, 3 herbicides, 1 plant-growth regulator and 1 other compound) were found to be mutagenic. 5 of them required metabolic activation (S9 mix) for their activities. Among various chemical groups, organic phosphates, halogenated alkanes and dithiocarbamates showed higher ratios of mutagens. Although 22 of the pesticides tested have been reported to be carcinogenic, 7 of them, i.e., captain, DBCP, EDB, EDC, ETU, HEH and nitrofen, were detected as mutagens in the present assay.

97,"Curcumin (C) and its natural analogues demethoxycurcumin (dmC) and bisdemethoxycurcumin (bdmC), known for their potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic effects, were tested for their possible inhibitory effects against seven cooked food mutagens (heterocyclic amines): 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1), in both TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium using Ames Salmonella/reversion assay in the presence of Aroclor induced rat liver S9 homogenate. In the present investigations, curcumin as well as its two natural analogues i.e., dmC and bdmC were found to be highly effective in suppressing genotoxicity of all the tested cooked food mutagens in a dose-dependent manner, in both the frame shift (TA98) as well as base pair mutation sensitive (TA100) strains of S. typhimurium. However, bdmC appeared to be a relatively less active antimutagen compared to C and dmC. More than 80% inhibition of mutagenicity was observed at 200 microg/plate in case of C and dmC in both TA98 and TA100 against all tested cooked food mutagens. Where as, bdmC showed 39-79% inhibition in TA100 and 60-80% inhibition in TA98, at a dose of 200 microg/plate. These findings warrant further biochemical, enzymatic and in vivo investigations in animal models as well as in humans to establish the chemoprotective effect of these agents against mutagenic heterocyclic amines found in cooked food.",Is Curcumin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
98,"The effects of curcumin, the yellow pigment of the spice, turmeric (Curcuma longa) on the mutagenicity of several environmental mutagens were investigated in the Salmonella/microsome test with or without Aroclor 1254-induced rat-liver homogenate (S-9 mix). With Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the presence of S-9 mix, curcumin inhibited the mutagenicity of bidi and cigarette smoke condensates, tobacco and masheri extracts, benzo[a]pyrne and dimethyl benzo[a]anthracene in a dose-dependent manner. Curcumin did not influence the mutagenicity without S-9 mix of sodium azide, monoacetylhydrazine and streptozocin in strain TA100 nor of 4-nitrophenylenediamine in strain TA98.

99,Chrysoidine dyes are used by fishermen to colour bait and recent epidemiological evidence has suggested that this may explain why they are at increased risk of urothelial cancer. In recent years Bismark brown dyes have been used as chrysoidine substitutes. Previous mutagenicity studies on these azo-dyes have examined only one variety of dye and used only one type of activating enzyme. In this study six samples of chrysoidine and three samples of Bismark brown dye have been obtained from chemical suppliers and from angling sources. They have been analysed by n.m.r. spectroscopy to determine whether they contain ring methyl groups. The mutagenic potency of each dye has been assessed by the Salmonella typhimurium/mammalian microsomal mutagenicity assay utilizing the TA100 and TA98 stains. Those dyes with methyl substitutions have been found to be more potent mutagens than their non-methylated counterparts using either human or rat metabolic preparations and irrespective of whether the enzymes have been induced with phenobarbitone.,Is Chrysoidine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
100,"14 pesticides were tested as pure compounds for the induction of point mutations in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium--TA1535, TA1536, TA1537 and TA1538--in the presence and in the absence of rat-liver microsomal fractions and for the induction of resistance to low concentrations of streptomycin in the filamentous bacterium, Streptomyces coelicolor. The technique used was essentially the so-called ""spot test"". The pesticides investigated were: aminotriazole, Benomyl, Captafol, Captan, Dichlorvos, Dalapon-Na, Dinobuton, Dodine, Ioxynil, Mecoprop, Neburon, Picloram, Triallate and Trichlorphon. In Salmonella, Captan and Triallate were mutagenic on the TA1535 strain; Dichlorvos and Trichlorphon were negative in the spot test but mutagenic after incubation in liquid cultures of strain TA1535. By using the S. coelicolor forward-mutation test, aminotriazole, Dichlorvos, Picloram, Trichlorphon and Triallate were mutagenic with the ""spot test"" technique; Captan showed a weak mutagenic activity with a ""plate-incorporated"" technique.",Is Dalapon mutagenic for TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
101,"Allyl acetate, allyl alcohol, and acrolein are used in the manufacture of detergents, plastics, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals and as agricultural agents and food additives. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F(1) mice received allyl acetate, allyl alcohol, or acrolein by gavage for 14 weeks. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Drosophila melanogaster, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, rat bone marrow erythrocytes, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were administered 0, 6, 12, 25, 50, or 100 mg allyl acetate/kg body weight, 0, 1.5, 3, 6, 12, or 25 mg/kg allyl alcohol, or 0, 0.75, 1.25, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg acrolein in 0.5% methylcellulose by gavage, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were administered 0, 8, 16, 32, 62.5, or 125 mg/kg allyl acetate, 0, 3, 6, 12, 25, or 50 mg/kg allyl alcohol, or 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg acrolein in 0.5% methylcellulose by gavage, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. In the allyl acetate rat study, all males and females in the 100 mg/kg groups died or were killed moribund by day 8; there were no other deaths. In the allyl alcohol study, all rats survived to the end of the study except one 6 mg/kg female. In the acrolein rat study, eight males and eight females in the 10 mg/kg groups died by week 9 of the study. Two males in the 2.5 and 5 mg/kg groups and one or two females in the 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg groups also died early; two of these deaths were gavage accidents. In the allyl acetate mouse study, all males and females in the 125 mg/kg group died during the first week of the study. All other early deaths, except five 62.5 mg/kg males and one 32 mg/kg female, were gavage accidents. In the allyl alcohol mouse study, one 50 mg/kg female died due to a gavage accident; all other animals survived to the end of the study. In the acrolein mouse study, all males and females administered 20 mg/kg died during the first week of the study. All other early deaths, except one male and one female administered 10 mg/kg, were unrelated to chemical administration. The concentration of 3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid (3-HPM) in the urine of rats and mice was determined after the first dose of chemical and at the end of the 14-week study. At both time points, the concentrations of 3-HPM in the urine of animals that received allyl acetate or allyl alcohol increased linearly with dose. In animals dosed with acrolein, the concentrations of 3-HPM exhibited a nonlinear increase with dose at the first time point. At the end of the study, the concentration of 3-HPM in the urine of animals dosed with acrolein was linear with dose except at the highest concentration administered. Since urine volumes were not recorded during the urine collection, complete quantitation of these data was not possible. The final mean body weights and mean body weight gains of male rats administered 12 or 50 mg/kg allyl acetate and of male and female rats administered 10 mg/kg acrolein were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls. The mean body weight gain of male mice in the 50 mg/kg group in the allyl alcohol study was also less than that of the vehicle controls. Final mean body weights and mean body weight gains of dosed female rats and male and female mice in the allyl acetate studies, male and female rats and female mice in the allyl alcohol studies, and male and female mice in the acrolein studies were generally similar to those of the respective vehicle controls. Clinical findings related to allyl acetate administration included pallor, eye or nasal discharge, ruffled fur, lethargy, diarrhea, and thinness among rats in the 100 mg/kg groups and lethargy, abnormal breathing, thinness, and ruffled fur among mice that died early. In the acrolein study, clinical findings included abnormal breathing, eye or nasal discharge, ruffled fur, thinness, and lethargy in rats in the 10 mg/kg groups. The liver weights of male rats administered 25 mg/kg allyl alcohol, female rats administered 50 mg/kg allyl acetate or 5 or 10 mg/kg acrolein, and male mice administered 10 mg/kg acrolein were significantly greater than those of the vehicle controls. Female rats administered 10 mg/kg acrolein had significantly lower absolute and relative thymus weights than did the vehicle controls. Female rats administered 25 mg/kg allyl alcohol spent more time in diestrus and less time in metestrus than the vehicle controls. The estrous cycles of female mice dosed with 16 or 32 mg/kg allyl acetate were significantly longer than that of the vehicle controls. Gross lesions related to allyl acetate treatment were observed in the liver, forestomach, and thorax/abdomen of male and female rats in the 100 mg/kg groups. Microscopically, the incidences of forestomach squamous epithelial hyperplasia were significantly increased in male rats administered 12 mg/kg or greater, female rats administered 25 or 50 mg/kg, male mice administered 32 or 62.5 mg/kg, and female mice administered 16, 32, or 62.5 mg/kg. Forestomach necrosis, hemorrhage, and inflammation were present in most rats in the 100 mg/kg groups, and the incidence of hemorrhage in 125 mg/kg male mice was increased; male mice in the 62.5 and 125 mg/kg groups and 125 mg/kg female mice had significantly increased incidences of glandular stomach hemorrhage. Increased incidences of several liver lesions occurred in male or female rats administered 50 or 100 mg/kg, and to a lesser extent in 25 mg/kg rats, 62.5 mg/kg male mice, and 125 mg/kg male and female mice. Bone marrow hyperplasia, hemorrhage or depletion in the mediastinal, mandibular, and mesenteric lymph nodes, hemorrhage and necrosis of the thymus, and hematopoietic cell proliferation of the red pulp were also observed in 100 mg/kg rats. Increased incidences of necrosis in the mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus were observed in 62.5 and 125 mg/kg mice. Male and female rats administered 6 mg/kg allyl alcohol or greater and male and female mice administered 12 mg/kg allyl alcohol or greater had significantly increased incidences of squamous hyperplasia of the forestomach epithelium. Female rats in the 25 mg/kg group had significantly increased incidences of bile duct hyperplasia and periportal hepatocyte hypertrophy in the liver. Incidences of portal cytoplasmic vacuolization were significantly increased in 50 mg/kg male mice and female mice in the 25 and 50 mg/kg groups. Gross lesions related to acrolein treatment were observed in the forestomach and glandular stomach of male and female rats in the 10 mg/kg groups and 20 mg/kg female mice. Microscopically, the incidences of squamous hyperplasia of the forestomach epithelium were significantly increased in male rats in the 5 and 10 mg/kg groups, female rats administered 2.5 mg/kg or greater, and male and female mice administered 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg. Male and female rats in the 10 mg/kg groups and 20 mg/kg male and female mice had significantly increased incidences of glandular stomach hemorrhage. Female mice in the 20 mg/kg group also had significantly increased incidences of glandular stomach inflammation and epithelial necrosis. Allyl acetate was mutagenic in S. typhimurium strains TA100 and TA1535, in the absence of S9 activation. With S9, no mutagenicity was detected in these two strains; negative results were obtained in strains TA97 and TA98, with and without S9. Allyl alcohol was not mutagenic in four strains of S. typhimurium, with or without S9 metabolic activation. Acrolein, tested in a preincubation protocol, was weakly mutagenic in S. typhimurium strain TA100 in the presence of 10% induced rat liver S9. Equivocal results were obtained in strains TA100 and TA1535 with 10% induced hamster liver S9. Negative results were obtained with TA97, TA98, and TA1538 under all test conditions, and acrolein gave negative results in all four S. typhimurium strains tested for mutation induction under a vapor protocol. No induction of micronuclei was noted in bone marrow erythrocytes of male rats administered allyl acetate by gavage three times at 24-hour intervals. No significant increases in micronucleated erythrocytes were noted in bone marrow samples from male rats administered allyl alcohol by intraperitoneal injection for 3 days. A small, but significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes was observed in the peripheral blood of female mice administered allyl acetate by gavage for 14 weeks; no increase was observed in male mice. No increases in the frequencies of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes were observed in the peripheral blood of male or female mice administered allyl alcohol or acrolein by gavage for 14 weeks. Acrolein induced sister chromatid exchanges in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells in the absence, but not the presence, of S9; it did not induce chromosomal aberrations, with or without S9.

102,"We have previously described a very sensitive and efficient bacterial test designed to detect chemical carcinogens as mutagens. Chloroacetaldehyde is mutagenic in this system and is of interest because it is a possible metabolite in mammals of the large volume industrial chemicals 1,2-dichloroethane (ethylene dichloride) (3.5 billion kg/yr, U.S.) and vinyl chloride (2.5 billion kg/yr, U.S.), and of the antineoplastic agent cyclophosphamide. Chloroacetaldehyde reverts a new Salmonella bacterial tester strain (TA100). Chloroacetaldehyde is shown to be hundreds of times more effective in reversion of TA100 than is chloroethanol (ethylene chlorohydrin), a known metabolic precursor of chloroacetaldehyde and a possible metabolite of dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, or than vinyl chloride, which is itself mutagenic for TA100. Chloroethanol is shown to be activated by rat (or human) liver homogenates to a more highly mutagenic form with reversion properties similar to chloroacetaldehyde. Reversion properties of cyclophosphamide after in vitro metabolic activation suggest that chloroacetaldehyde is not the active mutagenic form of this antineoplastic drug.",Is Chloroethanol mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
103,"Amitrole is a herbicide which has been found to induce thyroid and liver tumours in rodents, yet demonstrates limited genotoxic activity. The lack of mutagenicity of this compound in Salmonella typhimurium when employing a standard liver microsomal fraction, combined with evidence of activation of amitrole by peroxidases, warranted an investigation employing this other pathway of metabolic activation. Using prostaglandin H synthase as the activating system, the aromatic amine 2-aminofluorene provided a convenient positive control for optimisation of the metabolising system. Under such conditions, amitrole did not induce elevated numbers of revertant colonies in Salmonella typhimurium TA98, neither did it display evidence of interference with histidine biosynthesis as had been reported. Amitrole also remained nonmutagenic when preincubated at varying pHs. Thus, it has been shown that the alternative activation system, prostaglandin H synthase, does not produce metabolites which are mutagenic in the Ames test.",Is Amitrole mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False

105,"A method is described for curing the Ames Salmonella mutagen tester strains of their Fels 1 and Fels 2 prophages with the aid of the antitumor drug daunorubicin. Non-lysogenic derivatives corresponding to TA100 and TA1535 were isolated and designated TAQ100 and TAQ1535 respectively. In addition, the Fels 1 monolysogens TAQ100F1 and TAQ1535F1, as well as the Fels 2 monolysogens TAQ100F2 and TAQ1535F2, were obtained. Finally, strains corresponding to TA98 and TA1538 cured of Fels 2, but retaining a cryptic Fels 1 (F1d) prophage were isolated and designated TAQ98F1d and TAQ1538F1d respectively. The various cured derivatives were identified by colony hybridization with 32P-labeled probes of Fels 1 and Fels 2 DNA. Southern blot hybridizations confirmed that phage-specific Fels DNA sequences were missing from the cured strains. The Fels 2-cured strains were resistant to Fels 2, but Fels 1 grew, albeit poorly, on the Fels 1-cured strains. Strains TAQ100F1, TAQ1535F1, TAQ100F2 and TAQ1535F2 were used in prophage induction assays, in the presence of rat-liver extract where necessary. Daunorubicin, bleomycin, mitomycin C, aflatoxin B1, 2-amino-dipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-2) were found to induce Fels 1 and/or Fels 2 in at least one of these strains. The induction of the Fels prophages in the TAQ monolysogens may provide a useful complement to the Ames test for the detection of DNA-damaging agents and potential carcinogens.",Is Daunorubicin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
106,"We previously showed that some (nonsubstituted) aziridines derived from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (arene imines) elicit various mutagenic and genotoxic effects in bacteria and mammalian cells and that these arene imines are active at much lower concentrations than the corresponding epoxide analogues. In the present study, N-substituted derivatives of phenanthrene 9,10-imine were investigated. All 10 derivatives studied showed direct mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium TA100. Some of the compounds additionally exhibited weak effects in the strains TA98 and TA1537. Most N-substituted derivatives were weaker mutagens than unsubstituted phenanthrene 9,10-imine but stronger mutagens than phenanthrene 9,10-oxide. Bulky substituents reduced the mutagenicity more than did small substituents. In addition, the derivatives with electron-withdrawing substituents (with the exception of N-chlorophenanthrene 9,10-imine) were weaker mutagens than those with electron-donating substituents. Phenanthrene 9,10-imine and five N-substituted derivatives were investigated to determine whether they induce gene mutations at the hgprt locus in V79 cells. Four compounds, including the parent aziridine, were positive in the V79 test. The other two compounds were negative. The mutagenic potencies in the V79 cell system did not correlate well with those obtained with the Salmonella system. Overall, the study shows that in addition to unsubstituted arene imines, N-substituted derivatives are mutagenic. This finding is of interest, as metabolic pathways leading from aromatic compounds to N-substituted arene imines are conceivable.","Is Phenanthrene 9,10-imine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1537 strain?",True
107,"Ochratoxin A (OTA) was, up to now, believed to be non-mutagenic in the classical Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation test. This was confirmed using rat liver microsomal fractions with the strains, TA1535, TA1538 and TA98, and up to 1210 micrograms/plate, utilizing an Ames microtest. However, using mice kidney microsomal fractions as metabolic activators, reverse mutations were obtained with the three strains used, in the presence of either NADP or arachidonic acid as cofactors. The mutagenicity was higher with arachidonic acid than with NADP using the TA1535 strain. This lends support to the results concerning the DNA or dGMP adducts obtained in vitro which were also higher in the presence of arachidonic acid, and indicate that several metabolic pathways of OTA can lead to genotoxic compounds. In addition, both base pair substitutions and frameshift mutations can be caused by OTA after metabolic activation.",Is Ochratoxin A mutagenic for TA98 or TA1535 strain?,False

109,"4-Aminobyphenyl (4-Ab), benzidine (Bz), and Bz congeners were evaluated for their ability to induce genotoxicity through an oxidative mechanism. The mutagenicity of these compounds was tested in the presence and absence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat S9 mix using Salmonella typhimurium tester strain TA102, which is sensitive to agents producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the presence of S9, 4-Ab, Bz, N-acetyl-benzidine, and 3,3-dimethoxybenzidine were strongly mutagenic in TA102, whereas, 3,3,5,5-tetra-methylbenzidine, 3,3-dimethylbenzidine (O-tolidine), and N,N-diacetylbenzidine were not mutagenic. In addition, 3,3-dichlorobenzidine and 4,4-dinitro-2-biphenylamine were directly mutagenic in TA102. Incorporation of the free radical and metal scavengers, catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), butylated hydroxytolune (BHT), and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) reduced the mutagenic responses of 4-Ab and Bz, whereas heat-inactivated catalase and SOD had no effect. 4-Ab and Bz also induced lipid peroxidation in the presence of S9 mix as shown using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay. The results of this study indicate that 4-Ab and Bz induce mutations through the induction of ROS.",Is BHT mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False
110,"Because of the increasing interest in the use of nitroxide radicals as antioxidants and probes for various applications in biological systems, the question of their toxicity is of paramount importance. Cytotoxicity and mutagenicity studies have been extensively performed with the commercially available aliphatic nitroxides, and the general outcome is that these compounds are nonmutagenic and relatively noncytotoxic. In this study, the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of a new class of aromatic nitroxides that we have synthesized (i.e., indolinonic and quinolinic nitroxides), whose antioxidant activity has been established in both chemical and biological systems, were evaluated and compared with those of two commercial nitroxides and with that of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The mutagenicity assay was performed using Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, and TA102, chosen on the basis of their ability to detect various types of mutations and their sensitivity to oxidative damage. None of the compounds tested were found to be mutagenic. The colony-forming assay (CFA) using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) AS52 cells was employed for determining the cytotoxicity of the test compounds. On comparing the effective dose that inhibits the CFA by 50% (IC(50)), most of the compounds tested on an equal molar concentration basis were less toxic than BHT. Therefore, the overall results obtained correlate well with the data reported in the literature on the toxicity of aliphatic nitroxides and lend support to the possible use of these compounds as therapeutic antioxidants.",Is BHT mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
111,"Nitric oxide (NO) is produced both by macrophages in vivo as a physiological response to infection and by a variety of cell types as an intercellular messenger. In addition, NO and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are significant components of many combustion processes. The ubiquitous exposure of humans to nitrogen oxides (NOx), both endogenously and exogenously, may play a significant role in the carcinogenic process due to nitrosation of amines by NOx. We report here that exposure to low concentrations of NO, alone or in combination with NO2, results in significantly enhanced mutation in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 using a modified Ames Salmonella reversion assay. The observed mutagenicity requires that the bacteria be actively dividing at the time of exposure to NO or NO2, suggesting that the nitrogen oxides, or their reaction products, function as direct-acting mutagens and that the induced lesion is easily repairable by non-dividing cells. Exposure to NO resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in the number of revertants approximately proportional to the square of the NO concentration from 0 to 20 ppm. NO was a more effective mutagen relative to NO2, however, the observed requirement for O2 suggests limited oxidation of NO (presumably to NO2) is necessary. Numerous lipid- and aqueous-phase inhibitors of nitrosation, as well as a number of other general antioxidants and free-radical trapping agents, were examined for their effectiveness in blocking the mutagenic effects of NO. The mutagenic activity of NO was most effectively inhibited by beta-carotene and tocopherols.

The compounds were not mutagenic in either indicator strain at concentrations ranging from 50 to 330 micrograms/plate (SQ: 3,5,3',5'-tetra-tert-butylstilbenequinone; VI-III: unidentified), 500 micrograms/plate (BE: 3,5,3',5'-tetra-tert-4,4'-dihydroxy-1,2-diphenylethylene; VI: 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl-4-tert-butylperoxy-2,5-cyclohexadienone ; VI-I: unidentified; VI-II: 3-acetyl-2,5-di-tert-cyclopenta-2,4-dienone) and 1000 micrograms/plate (BHT). The antimutagenic effects of BHT and its derivatives on mutagenesis by chemical agents were investigated in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 and Escherichia coli WP-2 hcr-. VI-II suppressed the mutagenesis induced in TA98 and TA100 by 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (AF-2) and that induced in WP-2 hcr- by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) without decreasing cell viability. In WP-2 hcr-, the mutagenesis induced by AF-2 and ethyl methanesulfonate was also suppressed significantly. Mutations induced by methyl methanesulfonate were slightly inhibited. However, VI-II had no effect on the mutagenesis induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine.",Is BHT mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
113,"The possible antimutagenic effects of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), ethoxyquin, disulfiram, indole-3-carbinol, indole-3-acetonitrile, sodium selenite and alpha-tocopherol on 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl-induced mutagenicity were studied using the Ames Salmonella/mammalian microsome assay system with strains TA98 and TA100. All seven compounds were nonmutagenic in both bacterial tester strains. The addition of or 50-250 micrograms of sodium selenite, 5-50 mg of alpha-tocopherol or 50-250 microgram of BHT per plate inhibited DMAB-induced mutagenicity in TA98 and/or TA100. Ethoxyquin, disulfiram and indole-3-carbinol increased DMAB-induced mutagenicity in TA100, whereas these compounds had little or no effect in TA98-3-acetonitrile had very little effect in either strain.",Is BHT mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
114,"The Ames assay employing Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98 was used to investigate potential interactions between aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and the phenolic antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyanisole, and propyl gallate. AFB1 doses were within the linear response range, and the antioxidants were used at levels of 0 to 50 micrograms per plate. All three antioxidants were nonmutagenic in either bacterial tester strain, with or without the hepatic S-9 enzyme preparation; toxic effects were observed at doses higher than 20 micrograms per plate. Butylated hydroxytoluene and butylated hydroxyanisole substantially increased AFB1-induced mutagenesis in the two tester strains with microsomal activation. The addition of 5 to 20 micrograms of butylated hydroxytoluene or hydroxyanisole to 5 to 20 ng of AFB1 per plate caused more than a twofold increase in the number of His+ revertants. Addition of propyl gallate resulted in only a moderate increase in the number of revertants. Whereas several anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic effects by phenolic antioxidants have been reported, particularly in studies with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the enhancement of mutagenic potency of AFB1 by these compounds suggests a specificity with respect to the chemical nature of AFB1.",Is Butylated hydroxytoluene mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False

116,"Montirelin hydrate (NS-3), a new drug for the treatment of disturbance of consciousness, was examined for mutagenicity in the reverse mutation test, the chromosome aberration test in vitro, and the micronucleus test in mice. The reverse mutation test was performed at dose range of 156.25-5,000 micrograms/plate using Salmonella typhimurium strains, TA1535, TA100, TA1537, and TA98, and Escherichia coli WP2uvrA. The drug did not increase revertant colonies significantly in any of the test strains with or without metabolic activation system (S-9mix). The chromosome aberration test was carried out at dose range of 300-4,800 micrograms/ml using cultured Chinese hamster lung cells (CHL/IU). No significant increases of the frequencies of cells with chromosomal aberrations were observed with or without metabolic activations. The micronucleus test was conducted in the bone marrow cells of Slc:ddY male mice. Mice were given the drug by a single intraperitoneal administration at doses of 0, 250, 500, 1,000, and 2,000 mg/kg. There were no significant increases in the frequencies of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes at any dose levels.

117,"The secondary nitroalkanes 2-nitropropane, 2-nitrobutane, 3-nitropentane and nitrocyclopentane, as well as their anionic forms (nitronates); the primary nitroalkanes 1-nitropropane, 1-nitrobutane, and 1-nitropentane and their respective nitronates; the nitrocarbinols 2-nitro-1-propanol, 2-nitro-1-butanol, 3-nitro-2-butanol, and 3-nitro-2-pentanol and their respective nitronates; 2-methyl-2-nitropropane, and 2-nitroso-2-nitropropane were tested in the Ames Salmonella assay using strains TA98, TA100 and TA102. Nitronates of the secondary nitroalkanes 2-nitropropane, 2-nitrobutane, 3-nitropentane, and nitrocyclopentane were significantly mutagenic in Salmonella strains TA100 and TA102 at 10-80 mumoles/plate, but the parent compounds were mutagenic at only a single dose level or were not mutagenic at all in the same dose range. The primary nitroalkanes and the nitrocarbinols were not mutagenic, or only marginally so, at the concentrations tested. The nitronates of the primary nitroalkanes and the nitrocarbinols reprotonated too rapidly under the conditions of the assay for adequate evaluation of mutagenicity. 2-Methyl-2-nitropropane was not mutagenic in strains TA100 and TA102; 2-nitroso-2-nitropropane was also not mutagenic in strains TA100 and TA102, but induced an equivocal mutagenic response in TA98. The positive Salmonella mutation data for the nitronates of the secondary nitroalkanes studied correlate very well with the very slow rate of reprotonation of secondary nitroalkane nitronates at pH 7.7 (Conaway et al. (1991) Cancer Res., 51, 3143), and provide further evidence that nitronates of secondary nitroalkanes, rather than the neutral parent forms with which they may be in equilibrium, are the more proximate mutagenic species.",Is 1-propanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False

121,"Chloroform and Bromoform are two abundant trihalomethanes found in Algerian drinking water. The investigation of the mutagenic hazard of these disinfection by-products was studied by Ames test as prokaryotic bioassay to show their mutagenic effects. For this, Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains were employed. Both chloroform and bromoform showed a direct mutagenic effect since the number of revertant colonies gradually increase in dose-dependent manner with all concentrations tested with the two bacterial strains and these were both in the absence and presence of S9 metabolic activation. The genotoxic hazard was also studied by random amplified polymorphic DNA test on the root cells of Allium cepa as eukaryotic bioassay. DNA extracted from the roots of the onion were incubated at different concentrations of chloroform and bromoform and then amplified by polymerase chain reaction. This was based on demonstrating a major effect of disappearance of bands compared to roots incubated in the negative control (distilled water). The results showed that these two compounds affected genomic DNA by breaks although by mutations.",Is Chloroform mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
122,"Four extracts were prepared from the leaves of Nitraria retusa; methanol, ethyl acetate, chloroform and hexane extracts. An assay for the ability of these extracts to prevent mutations induced by various oxidants in Salmonella typhimurium TA102 and TA 104 strains was conducted. These extracts from leaf parts of N. retusa showed no mutagenicity either with or without the metabolic enzyme preparation (microsome fraction). The highest protection against methylmethanesulfonate induced mutagenicity was observed with chloroform and methanol extracts with inhibition percentages of 44.93% (at 50 microg/plate in the presence of TA102 strain) and 38% (at 10 microg/plate in the presence of TA104 strain), respectively. Whereas Hexane and chloroform extracts reduced the mutagenicity induced by 2-aminoanthracene by 83.4% (using the S. typhimurium TA104 assay system) and 65.3% (using the S. typhimurium TA 102 assay system), respectively. Antioxidant activity of N. retusa extracts was determined by the ability of each extract to protect plasmid DNA against strand scission induced by hydroxyl radicals. Chloroform extract exhibited the highest ability to protect plasmid DNA against hydroxyl radical induced DNA damages and exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity, with 0.95mM trolox equivalent when tested by the ferric reducing/antioxidant method.",Is Chloroform mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False
123,"The potent carcinogen N-nitrosodiethanolamine (NDELA) becomes mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 when activated by alcohol dehydrogenase from yeast or horse liver. Metabolic pathways different from alpha-oxidation might therefore be important for the activation of N-nitroso-2-hydroxyalkylamines such as NDELA. In an in-vitro test system (Namalva cells), neither NDELA nor N-nitrosoethyl-2-hydroxyethylamine was genotoxic, whereas the corresponding metabolites from alcohol dehydrogenase-mediated oxidation, N-nitroso-2-hydroxymorpholine and N-nitrosoethylethanalamine, induced single-strand breaks even at low doses. An immuno-slot-blot assay was used to study the formation of O6-2-hydroxyethyldeoxyguanosine in rat liver after oral administration of different N-nitroso-2-hydroxyalkylamines. When given at equimolar doses (0.375 mmol/kg), DNA hydroxyethylation was considerably lower (6.7 mumol/mol deoxyguanosine) with NDELA than with N-nitrosoethyl-2-hydroxyethylamine (48.7 mumol/mol deoxyguanosine) or N-nitrosomethyl-2-hydroxyethylamine (72.1 mumol/mol deoxyguanosine).

124,"Chlorogenic acid, a compound which occurs naturally in many food items, was assayed for genotoxic activity in 3 different test systems: reverse mutations in the preincubation test with Salmonella typhimurium, gene conversion with Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain D7, and chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Chlorogenic acid was directly convertogenic and clastogenic, but lacked a mutagenic capacity in the Salmonella bioassay. The transition metal Mn2+ enhanced the clastogenic and convertogenic activity of chlorogenic acid. In the presence of Mn2+ (10(-4)M), chlorogenic acid increased the frequency of his+ revertants in TA98 and TA100 strains of S. typhimurium.

125,"A precise understanding of differences in genomic mutations according to the mutagenic mechanisms detected in mutagenicity data is required to evaluate the carcinogenicity of environmental mutagens. Recently, we developed a highly accurate genome sequencing method, 'Hawk-Seq™', that enables the detection of mutagen-induced genome-wide mutations. However, its applicability to detect various mutagens and identify differences in mutational profiles is not well understood. Thus, we evaluated DNA samples from Salmonella typhimurium TA100 exposed to 11 mutagens, including alkylating agents, aldehydes, an aromatic nitro compound, epoxides, aromatic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We extensively analysed mutagen-induced mutational profiles and studied their association with the mechanisms of mutagens. Hawk-Seq™ sensitively detected mutations induced by all 11 mutagens, including one that increased the number of revertants by approximately 2-fold in the Ames test. Although the sensitivity for less water-soluble mutagens was relatively low, we increased the sensitivity to obtain high-resolution spectra by modifying the exposure protocol. Moreover, two epoxides indicated similar 6- or 96-dimensional mutational patterns; likewise, three SN1-type alkylating agents indicated similar mutational patterns, suggesting that the mutational patterns are compound category specific. Meanwhile, an SN2 type alkylating agent exhibited unique mutational patterns compared to those of the SN1 type alkylating agents. Although the mutational patterns induced by aldehydes, the aromatic nitro compound, aromatic amines and PAHs did not differ substantially from each other, the maximum total base substitution frequencies (MTSFs) were similar among mutagens in the same structural groups. Furthermore, the MTSF was found to be associated with the carcinogenic potency of some direct-acting mutagens. These results indicate that our method can generate high-resolution mutational profiles to identify characteristic features of each mutagen. The detailed mutational data obtained by Hawk-Seq™ can provide useful information regarding mutagenic mechanisms and help identify its association with the carcinogenicity of mutagens without requiring carcinogenicity data.",Is aldehydes mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
126,"The algal extracellular products (ECPs) in three cultures of cyanobacteria species (Anabaena, Microcystis, and Oscillatoria) dominating the eutrophic reservoir populations and their toxins have been investigated in the present work. Using gas chromatography coupled with high-resolution electron-impact mass spectrometry (GC/EI-MS) and high performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) techniques, more than 20 compounds were found in the algal culture (including cells and filtrates) extracts. The main identified ECPs were classified to polysaccharides, hydrocarbons, and aldehydes. Odor causing substances such as trans-1,10-dimethyl-trans-9-decalol (geosmin) and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB)were also found in the algal cultures. The potential mutagenicity of the algal suspensions was also studied with the Ames test. The organic extracts of the algal suspension from the axenic cultures were mutagenicity in TA98 without S9 mix and in TA100 with and without S9 mix. The results indicate that the ECPs of three algae species dominating the eutrophic reservoir were mutagenic clearly in the bacterial test.",Is aldehydes mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
127,"The essential oils and their monoterpenoid constituents have been widely used as fragrances in cosmetics, as flavouring food additives, as scenting agents in a variety of household products, as active ingredients in some old drugs, and as intermediates in the synthesis of perfume chemicals. The present study was undertaken to investigate the mutagenic potential of six monoterpenoid compounds: two aldehydes (citral and citronellal), a ketone ((+/-)-camphor), an oxide (1,8-cineole, also known as eucalyptol), and two alcohols (terpineol and (-)-menthol). It is part of a more comprehensive toxicological screening of monoterpenes under way at our laboratory. Mutagenicity was evaluated by the Salmonella/microsome assay (TA97a, TA98, TA100 and TA102 tester strains), without and with addition of an extrinsic metabolic activation system (lyophilized rat liver S9 fraction induced by Aroclor 1254). In all cases, the upper limit of the dose interval tested was either the highest non-toxic dose or the lowest dose of the monoterpene toxic to TA100 strain in the preliminary toxicity test. No mutagenic effect was found with (+/-) camphor, citral, citronellal, 1,8-cineole, and (-) menthol. Terpineol caused a slight but dose-related increase in the number of his+ revertants with TA102 tester strain both without and with addition of S9 mixture. The results from this study therefore suggest that, with the exception of terpineol, the monoterpenoid compounds tested are not mutagenic in the Ames test.",Is aldehydes mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
128,"2-Chlorocinnamaldehyde and 2-bromocinnamaldehyde, compounds of practical interest, for example, as bacteriocides and fungicides or for utilization in light sensitive layers, were tested in the Ames preincubation test with various Salmonella typhimurium strains, and in the SOS chromotest with Escherichia coli PQ 37.2-Chlorocinnamaldehyde was clearly mutagenic in strain TA 100 (6081 revertants/mumol) and in strain TA 98 (3050 revertants/mumol) without S9 mix, and was clearly positive in the SOS chromotest (SOSIP = 0.181). 2-Bromocinnamaldehyde was a strong mutagen in strain TA 100 (105, 500 revertants/mumol), in strain TA98 (41567 revertants/mumol) and in strain TA 1538 (15825 revertants/mumol), and also unambiguously mutagenic in strain TA 1535 (2110 revertants/mumol) without S9 mix. The SOSIP in the SOS chromotest was 1.5. Addition of S9 mix led to a marked decrease in the mutagenic activity of 2-bromocinnamaldehyde in all strains tested. In the case of strain TA 1535, mutagenic activity was abolished or not significant in the presence of S9 mix. The possible primary mechanisms underlying these mutagenic effects are discussed. Frame-shift activity of these halocinnamaldehydes can be explained by their planar structure.",Is aldehydes mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
129,"The mutagenicity of a series of nine alpha-dicarbonyl compounds against S. typhimurium strain TA100 was studied using the Ames test (standard plate incorporation assay) without preincubation.

These compounds can be grouped in three series: aldehydes, ketones and enolizable ketones (1,2-cyclohexanedione). In each of the two first groups the mutagenic activity decreases when the size of the substituent increases. No relation was found between the mutagenicity and the molecular electronic and/or resonance parameters. The low or non-existent activity of some of the chemicals studied is discussed.

131,"A new tester strain, TA102, is described as an addition to the set of strains for the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test. This strain contains A X T base pairs at the site of the mutation (determined by DNA sequence analysis) in contrast to the other Salmonella tester strains that detect mutagens damaging G X C base pairs. This strain differs from previous tester strains in that the mutation has been introduced into a multicopy plasmid, so that approximately equal to 30 copies of the mutant gene are available for back mutation. The new strain detects a variety of oxidative mutagens, including x-rays, bleomycin, hydrogen peroxide and other hydroperoxides, streptonigrin and other quinones, and phenylhydrazine; a variety of aldehydes, including formaldehyde, glyoxal, kethoxal, glutaraldehyde, and malondialdehyde; a number of psoralens (in the presence of near-UV light), mitomycin C, neocarzinostatin, and UV light. Some of these mutagens have been previously shown to damage thymine in DNA. Several auxiliary tester strains also are described, including TA96, a frameshift tester strain with a hot spot for mutation at a run of five A X T base pairs with a specificity similar to that of TA102.

132,"Solutions of 2-deoxy-D-ribose and D-ribose were gamma-irradiated under different experimental conditions and tested for mutagenicity, with and without preincubation, in Salmonella typhimurium. The irradiated sugar solutions were mutagenic in the tester strains TA100 and TA98. Except for malonaldehyde (MDA), which is not mutagenic in the concentrations produced radiolytically, the relative mutagenicities of the individual radiolytic products are unknown. With irradiated solutions of 2-deoxy-D-ribose, a relationship was found between the level of non-MDA aldehydes and the mutagenicity in TA100. Heating the irradiated solutions of 2-deoxy-D-ribose resulted in a temperature-dependent reduction of the mutagenicity.

133,"Formaldehyde was examined for bacterial mutagenicity using Escherichia coli WP2(pKM101) and WP2uvrA(pKM101), and Salmonella typhimurium TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98, TA100 and TA102, in the absence of any exogenous source of metabolic activation. Using pre-incubation exposure, clear mutagenicity was seen for TA98, TA100 and TA102, and both E. coli strains. In standard plate-incorporation assays, consistent mutagenicity was seen only for TA100 and WP2uvrA(pKM101). No evidence of mutagenicity was seen for TA1535, TA1537 or TA1538 using either method of exposure. These data confirm the enhanced ability of the pre-incubation method to detect the mutagenicity of formaldehyde both quantitatively, as expressed by numbers of revertant colonies, and qualitatively, in terms of the range of indicator strains reverted. The relatively greater sensitivity of the pre-incubation assay is probably due to better containment of a volatile agent and/or lack of interaction with agar during the initial period of exposure. The findings are consistent with the suggestion that formaldehyde induces lesions in bacteria which are, at least to some extent, excision-repairable, and indicate that the presence of the R-factor plasmid may be required for the expression of its mutagenicity in excision repair-deficient Salmonella.",Is Formaldehyd mutagenic for pKM101 or TA100 or TA1535 or WP2uvrA or TA102 or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,True
134,"Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP) is an unstable organic peroxide used in the manufacture of acrylic resins, as a hardening agent for fiberglass-reinforced plastics, and as a curing agent for unsaturated polyester resins. It is commercially available as a 40% to 60% solution in dimethyl phthalate (DMP). Because exposure to MEKP is typically through dermal contact, 2-week and 13-week toxicity studies were conducted by topical application of MEKP in DMP (45:55 w/w) to the clipped dorsal region of male and female Fischer 344/N rats and mice. Animals were evaluated for histopathology and for reproductive endpoints. In vitro genetic toxicity studies of MEKP included assessments of mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium and in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells and analysis of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In addition, the peripheral blood of mice from the 13-week study was evaluated in the micronucleus assay. In the 2-week studies, groups of 5 animals of each species and sex were administered MEKP in DMP for 5 days per week at doses of 50.6, 101.3, 202.5, 405, and 810 mg/kg body weight per day for rats and 112.5, 225, 450, 900, and 1800 mg/kg body weight per day for mice. Control groups received DMP or no treatment. No rats died during the studies, but at least 1 mouse in each group receiving MEKP died. Body weight gains of rats decreased with increasing doses of MEKP; body weight gains of mice were not affected by treatment. The primary effects of topical administration of MEKP in both rats and mice were an extensive coagulative necrosis of the epidermis and dermis, variable degrees of inflammation of the adnexa, and epidermal regeneration and hyperplasia at the application site. Lesions considered secondary to the dermal lesions included increased hematopoiesis in the spleen in rats and mice and increased myeloid hyperplasia of the bone marrow in mice, primarily at the higher doses. Mice showed a marked, dose-related increase in liver weight. In the 13-week dermal studies, groups of 10 rats and 10 mice of each sex were administered MEKP in DMP for 5 days per week at doses of 1.07, 3.57, 10.7, 35.7, and 107 mg/rat and 0.357, 1.19, 3.57, 11.9, and 35.7 mg/mouse. All high-dose mice, 3 high-dose female rats, and 1 female mouse in the 11.9 mg/animal group died or were sacrificed during the first week of the studies. Skin lesions similar to those seen in the 2-week studies were judged of sufficient severity to warrant early termination of surviving rats and mice in the 2 highest dose groups. All rats and mice in the remaining dose groups survived to the end of the studies, and weight gains were generally lower with increasing doses of MEKP. Skin lesions at the application site for the remaining animals (rats and mice) in the 10.7 mg/rat and 3.57 mg/mouse dose groups involved a spectrum of necrosis, inflammation, and acanthosis (epidermal hyperplasia). Lesions in the lower dose groups were limited to acanthosis and hyperkeratosis in rats (1.07 and 3.57 mg/rat) and acanthosis in mice (0.357 and 1.19 mg/mouse). While splenic and bone marrow lesions similar to those described in the 2-week studies were seen in animals that died early in the 13-week studies and in the rats and mice that showed ulcerative or necrotic injury, no other systemic changes were noted in animals that did not show ulcerative skin lesions. In genetic toxicity studies, MEKP in DMP (45:55 w/w) was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA1537, or TA98, with or without S9activation. A positive response was obtained in the mouse lymphoma assay for induction of trifluorothymidine resistance in L5178Y cells without S9. In cytogenetic tests with Chinese hamster ovary cells, MEKP induced sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations, with and without S9. No increase in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes was observed in peripheral blood samples obtained from male and female mice at the termination of the 13-week toxicity study. In summary, topical administration of MEKP in DM of MEKP in DMP resulted in a spectrum of necrotic, inflammatory, and regenerative skin lesions limited to the application site. Histopathologic changes in the spleen and bone marrow were also seen in rats and mice with ulcerative skin lesions, and were considered a secondary response.

135,"Formaldehyde was examined for bacterial mutagenicity using Escherichia coli WP2(pKM101) and WP2uvrA(pKM101), and Salmonella typhimurium TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98, TA100 and TA102, in the absence of any exogenous source of metabolic activation. Using pre-incubation exposure, clear mutagenicity was seen for TA98, TA100 and TA102, and both E. coli strains. In standard plate-incorporation assays, consistent mutagenicity was seen only for TA100 and WP2uvrA(pKM101). No evidence of mutagenicity was seen for TA1535, TA1537 or TA1538 using either method of exposure. These data confirm the enhanced ability of the pre-incubation method to detect the mutagenicity of formaldehyde both quantitatively, as expressed by numbers of revertant colonies, and qualitatively, in terms of the range of indicator strains reverted. The relatively greater sensitivity of the pre-incubation assay is probably due to better containment of a volatile agent and/or lack of interaction with agar during the initial period of exposure. The findings are consistent with the suggestion that formaldehyde induces lesions in bacteria which are, at least to some extent, excision-repairable, and indicate that the presence of the R-factor plasmid may be required for the expression of its mutagenicity in excision repair-deficient Salmonella.",Is Formaldehyde mutagenic for pKM101 or TA100 or TA1535 or WP2uvrA or TA102 or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,True
136,"Erythrosine (diNa, tetraiodofluorescein) was nonmutagenic to the Ames/Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102, and TA104, to a concentration of 2 mg/plate. No mutative intermediates were detected on metabolism by rat caecal cell-free extracts or rat liver S9 mixture; or on incubation with the comutagens, harman and norharman (+/- S9). Instead, an unexpected dose-dependent suppression in spontaneous reversion frequencies was observed (maximum approximately equal to 35% decrease). Erythrosine was antimutagenic to benzo[a]pyrene, but it did not decrease the mutagenicity of the other adduct-forming mutagen, 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide. The food dye was strongly antimutagenic to the bifunctional alkylating agent, mitomycin C, though it did not exhibit a similar effect on the mutagenicity of the corresponding monofunctional agent, methyl methanesulphonate. It partially depressed the mutagenic potentials of sodium azide. The antimutagenic effect of erythrosine on an intercalating agent, ethidium bromide, was discernible only at the highest dose (2 mg/plate). These results have been interpreted in terms of a genointeractive role of erythrosine. Erythrosine produced differential toxic effects in repair-deficient (TA97a, TA98, TA100) and repair-proficient (TA102, TA104) Salmonella tester strains; survival of the repair-deficient strains was found to be decreased. Photoinduced potentiation of erythrosine toxicity was observed, although light irradiation in the presence of erythrosine did not modify the reversion frequencies of the tester strains. The evidence strongly suggests that erythrosine, which exhibits nonmutagenicity in the Ames/Salmonella test, can interact with DNA repair enzymes and/or with DNA.",Is Erythrosin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False

Zearalenone is a mycotoxin produced by a grain contaminant, Fusarium graminearum (Gibberella zeae) and the isomers of zearalanol are reduced derivatives of this compound. The remaining compounds are all flavonoids which occur naturally at relatively high concentrations in many plants, particularly legumes. 4 of these flavonoids (daidzein, genistein, formononetin and biochanin-a) are isoflavones and the 5th, coumestrol, is a coumestan. Each compound was tested at several concentrations ranging from 1--500 micrograms per plate. The microsomal fracton was obtained from Aroclor 1254 (a PCB)-induced rat livers.

138,"The aims of this study are to determine the mutagenicity of a locally produced polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) using Salmonella mutagenicity test and to find out if PHB altered the expression of p53 and c-myc proto-oncogenes and bcl-xl and bcl-xs anti-apoptotic genes in the human fibroblast cell line, MRC-5. Different concentrations of PHB were incubated with special genotypic variants of Salmonella strains (TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98 and TA100) carrying mutations in several genes both with and without metabolic activation (S9) and the test was assessed based on the number of revertant colonies. The average number of revertant colonies per plate treated with PHB was less than double as compared to that of negative control. For the gene expression analyses, fibroblast cell lines were treated with PHB at different concentrations and incubated for 1, 12, 24 and 48 h separately. The total RNA was isolated and analysed for the expression of p53, c-myc, bcl-xl and bcl-xs genes. The PHB did not show over or under expression of the genes studied. The above tests indicate that the locally produced PHB is non-genotoxic and does not alter the expression of the proto-oncogenes and anti-apoptotic genes considered in this study.",Is PHB mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False

In the present study, the genotoxicity of these compounds was evaluated in Salmonella/microsome assays (in strains TA100 and TA98, with and without S9 and in TA98NR without S9), in chromosomal aberration (CA) tests with Chinese hamster fibroblasts (V79), and in micronucleus (MN) assays with human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. All compounds except the sulfonic acids were positive in the bacterial mutagenicity tests, with 2,4,6-TNBA producing the strongest response (8023 revertants/micromol in TA98 without S9 activation). 2-A-4,6-DNBA was a direct acting mutagen in TA98, but negative in TA100. The other positive compounds were approximately 1-3 orders of magnitude less mutagenic than 2,4,6-TNBA in TA98 and in TA100; relatively strong effects ( approximately 50-400 revertants/micromol) were produced by the benzylacohols in the two indicator strains. With the exception of 2,4-DNBA, the mutagenic responses were lower in the nitroreductase-deficient strain TA98NR than in the parental strain. 2,4-DNBA produced a marginally positive response in the V79-cell CA assay; the other substances were devoid of activity. Only the benzoic acids were tested for MN induction in HepG2 cells, and all produced positive responses. As in the bacterial assays, the strongest effect was seen with 2,4,6-TNBA (significant induction at >or=1.9 microM). 4-A-2,6-DNBA was positive at 432 microM; the weakest effect was observed with 2,4,-DNBA (positive at >or=920 microM). The differences in the sensitivity of the indicator cells to these agents can be explained by differences in the activities of enzymes involved in the activation of the compounds. The strong responses produced by some of the compounds in the human-derived cells suggest that environmental exposure to these breakdown products of nitro-explosives may pose a cancer risk in man.","Is 2,4-DNBA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?",True

These compounds were tested further using the Xenometrix strains of S. typhimurium: TA7001, TA7002, TA7003, TA7004, TA7005, and TA7006, with and without S9 mix in the plate incorporation assay. The direct-acting mutagenicity of 2NPD, 4NPD, and DNBA was detected with TA7002, TA7004 and TA7005. 2NPD and DNBA showed some activity in TA7006; DNBA also showed some activity in TA7003. Mutagenicity was generally decreased in these strains when S9 was added. 3NPD was mutagenic in TA7004 without S9 and in TA7005 with and without S9. These data suggest that 2NPD, 4NPD and DNBA induced TA-->AT and CG-->AT transversions as well as GC-->AT transitions in the his gene. 3NPD induced CG-->AT transversions and GC-->AT transitions. 2NPD and DNBA also induced a small portion of CG-->GC transversions.",Is DNBA mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
141,"Pesticide adjuvants (PAs) denote the general term for auxiliaries in pesticide preparations except for the active components. Toluene, chloroform, and trichloroethylene are the three most commonly used PAs as organic solvents. The residues of the three chemicals in the process of production and application of pesticides may endanger the ecosystem. In the present study, the mutagenicity of toluene, chloroform, and trichloroethylene as well the mixture of the three chemicals was tested by the  Salmonella typhimurium  reverse mutation test (Ames test) with TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA102 strains in the system with and without rat liver microsomal preparations (S9). The four tester strains have been used for more than 40 years to detect mutagenic compounds in chemicals, cosmetics, and environmental samples. The mutagenicity was detected on tester strains in the separated experiment from the three chemicals. The addition of S9 decreased the mutation ratios of toluene to four strains, except for the TA100 strain, but increased the mutation ratios of chloroform to four strains except for the TA98 strain. Trichloroethylene caused positive mutagenicity to become negative on the TA102 strain. In the mixed experiment, positive effects were detected only on the TA102 strain in the absence of S9. The addition of S9 increased the mutagenicity except for the TA102 strain. The mixture of toluene, chloroform, and trichloroethylene showed antagonism in mutagenicity to tester strains, except for the TA102 strain without S9.

142,"The nephrotoxicity and nephrocarcinogenicity of trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) are believed to be mediated primarily through the cysteine S-conjugate β-lyase-dependent bioactivation of the corresponding cysteine S-conjugate metabolites S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (DCVC) and S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (TCVC), respectively. DCVC and TCVC have previously been demonstrated to be mutagenic by the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay, and reduction in mutagenicity was observed upon treatment with the β-lyase inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA). Because DCVC and TCVC can also be bioactivated through sulfoxidation to yield the potent nephrotoxicants S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine sulfoxide (DCVCS) and S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine sulfoxide (TCVCS), respectively, the mutagenic potential of these two sulfoxides was investigated using the Ames Salmonella typhimurium TA100 mutagenicity assay. The results show both DCVCS and TCVCS were mutagenic, and TCVCS exhibited 3-fold higher mutagenicity than DCVCS. However, DCVCS and TCVCS mutagenic activity was approximately 700-fold and 30-fold lower than DCVC and TCVC, respectively. DCVC and DCVCS appeared to induce toxicity in TA100, as evidenced by increased microcolony formation and decreased mutant frequency above threshold concentrations. TCVC and TCVCS were not toxic in TA100. The toxic effects of DCVC limited the sensitivity of TA100 to DCVC mutagenic effects and rendered it difficult to investigate the effects of AOAA on DCVC mutagenic activity. Collectively, these results suggest that DCVCS and TCVCS exerted a definite but weak mutagenicity in the TA100 strain. Therefore, despite their potent nephrotoxicity, DCVCS and TCVCS are not likely to play a major role in DCVC or TCVC mutagenicity in this strain.",Is DCVC mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True

In the first set of studies, which involved the evaluation of these chemicals in the Microscreen prophage-induction assay, only DCA (+S9) was genotoxic, producing 6.6-7.2 plaque-forming units/mM. This places DCA among the weakest of the > 100 chemicals that have been identified previously as inducers of prophage in this assay. In the second set of studies, which involved the evaluation of these chemicals in the vapor state in Salmonella TA100 using a Tedlar bag vaporization technique, DCA (+/-S9), DCAC (-S9), and TCAC (+/-S9) were mutagenic, producing 3-5x increases in revertants/plate relative to the background. S9 enhanced the mutagenic potency of DCA but had no effect on the mutagenic potency of TCAC. The potencies ranged from 0.7 to 3.9 rev/p.p.m., resulting in a potency ranking of DCA > DCAC approximately TCAC. The lowest effective concentrations were 50-300 p.p.m., which are similar to those for ethylene oxide and epichlorohydrin in this assay. In the third set of studies, the mutation spectra of DCA, DCAC, and TCAC were determined at the base-substitution allele hisG46 of Salmonella TA100.

144,"Saffron is harvested from the dried, dark red stigmas of Crocus sativus L. flowers. It is used as a spice for flavoring and coloring food and as a perfume. It is often used for treating several diseases. We assessed the antimutagenic, comutagenic and cytotoxic effects of saffron and its main ingredients using the Ames/Salmonella test system, two well known mutagens (BP, 2AA), the in vitro colony formation assay and four different cultured human normal (CCD-18Lu) and malignant (HeLa, A-204 and HepG2) cells. When only using the TA98 strain in the Ames/Salmonella test system, saffron showed non-mutagenic, as well as non-antimutagenic activity against BP-induced mutagenicity, and demonstrated a dose-dependent co-mutagenic effect on 2-AA-induced mutagenicity. The saffron component responsible for this unusual comutagenic effect was safranal. In the in vitro colony formation test system, saffron displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect only against human malignant cells. All isolated carotenoid ingredients of saffron demonstrated cytotoxic activity against in vitro tumor cells. Saffron crocin derivatives possessed a stronger inhibitory effect on tumor cell colony formation. Overall, these results suggest that saffron itself, as well as its carotenoid components might be used as potential cancer chemopreventive agents.",Is Saffron mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False

The isolated compound suppressed the expression of the umu gene following the induction of SOS response in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 that have been treated with various mutagens. The suppressive compound was mainly localized in the n-hexane extract fraction of the processed D. nobile. This n-hexane fraction was further fractionated by silica gel column chromatography, which resulted in the purification and subsequent identification of the suppressive compound. EI-MS and (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy were then used to delineate the structure of the compound that confers the observed antimutagenic activity.

153,"Estrogens are indicated as being the most important etiological factors for the development and progression of breast cancer. The implication of estrogen in breast cancer has been associated mostly with the estrogen receptors that mediate cell proliferation. Evidence also exists to support the hypothesis of a direct role of estrogens as tumor initiators. However, the role of estrogen genotoxicity in breast cancer is still questionable. In this study the genotoxic activity of catecholestrogens and 16alpha-hydroxy estrone has been investigated by performing Salmonella strain TA98 and TA100 Ames tests, sister chromatide exchange assays (SCE) and micronucleus assays on human peripheral lymphocytes (CBMN and ARA/CBMN). We found a lack of positive results with micronucleus assays, except for 2-hydroxy estradiol (2-OHE(2)), which shows a peculiar ""bell shaped"" trend of micronucleus number versus concentrations. SCE assay suggests weak genotoxic activity of all tested catechol metabolites, except 4-hydroxy estrone (4-OHE(1)), which also showed negative results by ARA/CBMN.

154,"Anthraquinone (AQ) (9,10-anthracenedione) is an important compound in commerce. Many structurally related AQ derivatives are medicinal natural plant products. Examples include 1-hydroxyanthraquinone (1-OH-AQ) and 2-hydroxyanthraquinone (2-OH-AQ), which are also metabolites of AQ. Some commercial AQ is produced by the oxidation of anthracene (AQ-OX). In the recent past, the anthracene used was distilled from coal tar and different lots of derived AQ often contained polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants, particularly 9-nitroanthracene (9-NA). Many toxicology studies on AQ used contaminated anthracene-derived AQ-OX, including a National Toxicology Program (NTP) 2-year cancer bioassay that reported a weak to modest increase in tumors in the kidney and bladder of male and female F344/N rats and in the livers of male and female B6C3F1 mice. The AQ-OX used in that bioassay was mutagenic and contained 9-NA and other contaminants. In contrast, purified AQ is not genotoxic. The purpose of this paper is to provide additional information to help iterpret the NTP cancer bioassay. This paper describes a quantitative analytical study of the NTP anthracene-derived AQ-OX test material, and presents the results of mutagenicity studies with the 1-OH-AQ and 2-OH-AQ metabolites and the primary contaminant 9-NA. Purified 1-OH-AQ and 2-OH-AQ exhibited only weak mutagenic activity in selected strains of tester bacteria and required S9. Literature reports of potent mutagenic activity for 1-OH-AQ and 2-OH-AQ in bacteria minus S9 are, once again, very likely the result of the presence of contaminants in the test samples. Weak activity and limited production of the 1-OH-AQ and 2-OH-AQ metabolites are possible reasons that AQ fails to exhibit activity in numerous genotoxicity assays. 9-NA was mutagenic in tester strains TA98 and TA100 minus S9. This pattern of activity is consistent with that seen with the contaminated AQ-OX used in the NTP bioassay. Analysis of all the mutagenicity and analytical data, however, indicates that the mutagenic contamination in the NTP bioassay probably resides with compounds in addition to 9-NA. 9-NA exhibited potent mutagenic activity in the L5178Y mammalian cell mutagenicity assay in the presence of S9. The positive response was primarily associated with an increase in small colony mutants suggesting a predominance of a clastogenic mechanism. Quantitative mutagenicity and carcinogenicity potency estimates indicate that it is plausible that the contaminants alone in the NTP AQ-OX bioassay could have been responsible for all of the observed carcinogenic activity. Although AQ-OX is no longer commercially used in the United States, many of the reported genotoxicity and carcinogenicity results in the literature for AQ and AQ derivative compounds must be viewed with caution.",Is Anthraquinone mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
155,"Emodin is a naturally occurring anthraquinone present in the roots and bark of numerous plants of the genus Rhamnus. Extracts from the roots, bark, and/or dried leaves of buckthorn, senna, cascara, aloe, frangula, and rhubarb have been used as laxatives since ancient times and currently are widely used in the preparation of herbal laxative preparations. Anthraquinone glycosides are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but are cleaved by gut bacteria to produce aglycones (such as emodin) that are more readily absorbed and are responsible for the purgative properties of these preparations. There is extensive exposure to emodin and other anthraquinones resulting from the use of herb-based stimulant laxatives. Reports that 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone, a commonly used laxative ingredient, caused tumors in the gastrointestinal tract of rats raised the possibility of an association between colorectal cancer and the use of laxatives containing anthraquinones. Because emodin is a hydroxyanthraquinone structurally similar to 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone, is present in herbal laxatives, and was reported to be mutagenic in bacteria, it was considered a potential carcinogen and was selected for in-depth evaluation. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to emodin (at least 94% pure) in feed for 16 days, 14 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, rat and mouse bone marrow cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 16-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Groups of five male and five female rats were fed diets containing 0, 600, 2,000, 5,500, 17,000, or 50,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 50, 170, 480, 1,400, or 3,700 mg emodin/kg body weight to males and 50, 160, 460, 1,250, or 2,000 mg/kg to females) for 15 (males) or 16 (females) days. Three female rats died before the end of the study. Mean body weights of males and females exposed to 5,500 ppm or greater were significantly less than those of the controls. Feed consumption by males and females receiving 17,000 or 50,000 ppm was decreased throughout the study. Macroscopic lesions were present in the kidney of rats exposed to 17,000 or 50,000 ppm. 16-DAY STUDY IN MICE: Groups of five male and five female mice were fed diets containing 0, 600, 2,000, 5,500, 17,000, or 50,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 120, 400, 1,200, or 3,800 mg/kg to males and 140, 530, 1,600, or 5,000 mg/kg to females; 50,000 ppm equivalents were not calculated due to high mortality) for 15 (males) or 16 (females) days. All mice exposed to 50,000 ppm died before the end of the study. Mice in the 17,000 ppm groups lost weight during the study. Feed consumption by 5,500 ppm females was greater than that by the controls throughout the study. Macroscopic lesions were present in the gallbladder and kidney of mice exposed to 17,000 ppm. 14-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 312.5, 625, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 20, 40, 80, 170, or 300 mg/kg to males and females) for 14 weeks. Mean body weights of males exposed to 2,500 ppm or greater and females exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater were significantly less than those of the controls. During the first week of the study, feed consumption by males exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm and females exposed to 5,000 ppm was less than that by the controls. Feed consumption by these groups was similar to that by the controls for the remainder of the study. In rats exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm, there were increases in platelet counts in males and females and segmented neutrophil counts in females. Total serum protein and albumin concentrations were decreased in females exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm. Relative kidney weights of rats exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater and relative lung weights of rats exposed to 625 ppm or greater were significantly increased compared to the control groups. Relative liver weights were incree increased in females exposed to 625 ppm or greater. The estrous cycle length wassignificantly increased in females exposed to 1,250 or 5,000 ppm. All male rats exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater and all exposed female rats had pigment in the renal tubules; and the severity of pigmentation generally increased with increasing exposure concentration. The incidences of hyaline droplets in the cortical epithelial cytoplasm were increased in all groups of exposed males and in females exposed to 312.5, 625, or 1,250 ppm. 14-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were fed diets containing 0, 312.5, 625, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approxi mately 50, 100, 190, 400, or 800 mg/kg to males and 60, 130, 240, 500, or 1,100 mg/kg to females) for 14 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. Mean body weights of males exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm were significantly less than those of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed groups was generally similar to that by the controls. Relative kidney weights of male mice exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater, relative lung weights of males exposed to 625 ppm or greater, and relative liver weights of female mice exposed to 625 ppm or greater were increased. The incidences and severities of nephropathy were increased in males and females exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater. The incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in males exposed to 625 ppm or greater and in females exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 65 male and 65 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 280, 830, or 2,500 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 110, 320, or 1,000 mg/kg to males and 120, 370, or 1,100 mg/kg to females) for 105 weeks. Ten male and ten female rats from each group were necropsied at 6 months. Blood samples from five male and five female rats in each group were evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months for plasma emodin concentrations; these rats were necropsied at 12 months. Survival, Body Weights, and Feed Consumption: Survival of exposed males and females was similar to that of the controls. The mean body weights of rats in the 2,500 ppm groups were less than those of the controls beginning at week 2 of the study. Feed consumption by exposed groups was similar to that by the controls throughout the study. Pathology Findings: Three Zymbal's gland carcinomas were observed in female rats exposed to 2,500 ppm. This incidence exceeded the range observed for current historical controls and was considered an equivocal finding. At the 6- and 12-month interim evaluations and at 2 years, emodin-related increases in the incidences of renal tubule hyaline droplets occurred in all exposed groups. The incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males at 2 years. There were negative trends in the incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats, and the incidences in the 2,500 ppm groups were significantly decreased. In females exposed to 2,500 ppm, the incidence was below the historical control range; the incidence in males exposed to 2,500 ppm was at the lower end of the historical control range. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 60 male mice were fed diets containing 0, 160, 312, or 625 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 15, 35, or 70 mg/kg) for 105 weeks. Groups of 60 female mice were fed diets containing 0, 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 30, 60, or 120 mg/kg) for 105 weeks. Ten male and ten female mice from each group were necropsied at 12 months. Survival, Body Weights, and Feed Consumption Survival and mean body weights of exposed males and females were similar to those of the controls. No differences in feed consumption were noted between exposed and control groups. Pathology Findings: Low incidences of renal tubule adenoma and carcinoma occurred in exposed male mice; these incidences included one carcinoma each in the 312 and 625 ppm groups. Renal tubule neoplasms are rare in male mice, and their presence in these groups suggested a possible association with emodin exposure. At the 12-month interim evaluation, the severity of nephropathy was slightly increased in males exposed to 625 ppm. Also at 12 months, the severity of nephropathy increased from minimal in the lower exposure groups to mild in females exposed to 1,250 ppm; the incidence in this group was significantly increased compared to the control group. At 2 years, the severities of nephropathy were slightly increased in males exposed to 625 ppm and females exposed to 1,250 ppm. The incidences of nephropathy were significantly increased in all exposed groups of females. At the 12-month interim evaluation, the incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males and in females exposed to 625 or 1,250 ppm. The severities increased with increasing exposure concentration. At 2 years, the incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in all exposed groups; severities increased with increasing exposure concentration. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Emodin was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 in the presence of S9 activation; no mutagenicity was detected in strain TA98, with or without S9. Chromosomal aberrations were induced in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells treated with emodin, with and without S9. Three separate in vivo micronucleus tests were performed with emodin. A male rat bone marrow micronucleus test, with emodin administered by three intraperitoneal injections, gave negative results. Results of acute-exposure (intraperitoneal injection) micronucleus tests in bone marrow and peripheral blood erythrocytes of male and female mice were negative. In a peripheral blood micronucleus test on mice from the 14-week study, negative results were seen in male mice, but a weakly positive response was observed in similarly exposed females. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in male F344/N rats exposed to 280, 830, or 2,500 ppm. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in female F344/N rats based on a marginal increase in the incidence of Zymbal's gland carcinoma. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in male B6C3F1 mice based on a low incidence of uncommon renal tubule neoplasms. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in female B6C3F1 mice exposed to 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm. Exposure of rats to emodin resulted in increased incidences of renal tubule hyaline droplets and pigmentation in males, increased incidences of renal tubule hyaline droplets in females, and increased severities of renal tubule pigmentation in males and females. Emodin exposure resulted in increased incidences of renal tubule pigmentation in male and female mice and increased incidences of nephropathy in female mice. Incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia decreased in male and female rats exposed to 2,500 ppm. Synonyms: Archin; C.I. 75440; C.I. Natural Green 2; C.I.

156,"The mutagenicity of anthracene, anthraquinone, and four structurally similar compounds of each was evaluated in the Ames/Salmonella microsome assay. Anthraquinone was shown to be mutagenic for strains TA1537, TA1538, and TA98 in the absence of rat liver homogenate. The four anthraquinone derivatives tested were mutagenic for TA1537 exclusively.

157,"Methyl isocyanate (MIC) in aqueous solution forms methylamine (MA) and N,N'-dimethylurea (DMU). MA in buffered system further converts into its salt form, methylamine hydrochloride (MAH). Therefore, MAH and DMU were evaluated for their mutagenic activity in the in vitro Ames Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test. The liquid preincubation protocol was followed, using tester strains TA98, TA100 and TA104 of Salmonella typhimurium, in the presence of 0, 5, 15 and 30% Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver S9 mixture. DMU and MAH did not induce a mutagenic response in any of the tester strains, both in the presence and in the absence of S9 mixture. The results therefore confirm that MIC in its native form or as its unknown metabolites is responsible for the mutagenic activity reported earlier by us in the his tester strains TA100 and TA104 of Salmonella typhimurium (Mutation Res., 204 (1988) 123-129) and not due to its hydrolysis products, MA or DMU.",Is Methyl isocyanate mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
158,"Methyl isocyanate (MIC) was tested for mutagenicity using the Ames Salmonella/microsome liquid-preincubation procedure with slight modification of test conditions. In the modification the preincubation mixture was incubated at 10 degrees C for 60 min. MIC was assayed both in the presence and absence of Aroclor-1254-induced S9, using 5 tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium, TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102 and TA104. MIC induced mutagenic response in two base-pair substitution strains, TA100 and TA104, in the presence and absence of S9. However, mutagenic response in the presence of S9 was low as compared to that in the absence of S9. In the comparative mutagenic activity at 3 different preincubation test conditions (37 degrees C for 20 min, 20 degrees C for 40 min and 10 degrees C for 60 min), optimum mutagenic response was observed at 10 degrees C for the 60-min test condition. However, no mutagenic response was observed at 37 degrees C for the 20-min test condition.",Is Methyl isocyanate mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
159,"The antimutagenicity of ethanol extracts of bee glue (propolis) (EEBG) was evaluated, using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 as a test model, against two direct mutagens, 4-nitro-O-phenylenediamine (4-NO) and 1-nitropyrene (1-NP), and two indirect mutagens, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) with S9 mix. EEBG was shown to suppress the mutagenicity of these compounds in a dose-dependent fashion. To delineate the mechanism of action of the antimutagenic effects of EEBG on the two indirect mutagens IQ and B[a]P, two possible points of blocking were considered: (1) cytochrome P-450 activity (route 1) and (2) interaction with microsome-generated proximate mutagens to generate an inactive complex (route 2). Our results clearly demonstrated, at a very low dose, remarkable suppression of the mutagenicity of both compounds by inhibiting either route 1 or route 2 pathway. Further studies indicated that EEBG was capable of inhibiting both the activities of hepatic cytochrome P-450 IA1-linked 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and IA 2-linked 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase (ECD) in a similar dose-dependent manner. Taken together, we demonstrated that EEBG was a good inhibitor for mutagenicity of direct mutagens, 1-NP and 4-NO, as well as for the indirect mutagens IQ and B[a]P in the presence of S9 mix via inactivation of microsomal enzyme activities (e.g. EROD and ECD) or antagonizing metabolic generation of the proximate mutagens of IQ and B[a]P.",Is propolis mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False

None of the compounds was mutagenic without norharman. In the presence of norharman, however, nitrobenzene, nitrotoluene, nitroanisole, nitrochlorobenzene and nitrobenzaldehyde exhibited mutagenicity only to S. typhimurium TA98 with S9 mix. This induction of mutagenesis with norharman was strong for the ortho isomers of every nitro-compound, weak for the para isomers, and was not observed for the meta isomers.",Is 99-99-0 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
161,"Contamination of natural waters has been one of the major problems of modern society and the textile industry is rated as an important polluting source, due to the generation of large amounts of wastewaters. The aim of this study was to assess textile dyes Reactive Blue 19 (RB19, anthraquinone dye) and Reactive Red 120 (RR120, azo dye) in terms of the potential to induce adverse effects on aquatic organisms and humans. Thus, these dyes were tested using the following assays: Microtox assay (Vibrio fischeri); brine shrimp (Artemia salina); Daphnia similis; and Comet with normal human dermal fibroblasts as well as Ames test (TA98, TA100, YG1041, YG1042--with and without S9). RB19 was relatively nontoxic to all aquatic bioindicators analyzed with an EC50 of more than 100 mg/L, whereas RR120 was only moderately toxic to A. salina with a EC50-48h of 81.89 mg/L. Mutagenicity through base pair substitution was observed with RB19 in the presence of S9 (Ames-positive). The comet assay did not demonstrate any apparent genotoxic effects for any tested dye. Although mutagenicity was detected with RB19, the mutagenic effect observed may be considered weak compared to the ability to induce DNA damage by other classes of dyes such as disperse dyes. Therefore, these dyes may be classified as nonmutagens (RR120) or weak mutagens (RB19) and relatively nontoxic for aquatic organisms. However, it is noteworthy that the weak acute toxicity to A. salina induced by RR120 is sufficient to suggest potential damage to the aquatic ecosystem and emphasizes the need for biomonitoring dye levels in wastewater systems.",Is Reactive Blue 19 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
162,"A galactose- and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-specific lectin (Viscum album L. var. coloratum agglutinin, VCA), which is known for its anticancer activity, was isolated from mistletoe. In this study, we investigated the antimutagenic potentials of VCA by using the pre-incubation method of the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100) in the presence or absence of S9 mixture. Viscum album L. var. coloratum agglutinin was assessed for its antimutagenic properties against the mutagens 2-aminoanthracene (2AA) and furylfuramide (AF-2) for strain TA98, and sodium azide (NaN(3) ) and 2-aminoanthracene (2AA) for strain TA100. The concentrations used for this test compound were 100, 200 and 400 µg per plate.  Viscum album L. var. coloratum agglutinin showed moderate, but not negligible, protective effects regarding the antimutagenic properties against the direct-acting mutagens NaN(3) and AF-2. Furthermore, VCA was more effective in preventing the mutagenicity of the indirect-acting mutagen 2-AA (in the presence of S9) when tested with both TA98 and TA100. In conclusion, this report has shown broad ranging antimutagenic effects of VCA to numerous mutagens in TA98 and TA100 Salmonella typhimurium strains. Although the data presented here cannot be applied in vivo, they can support other antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic findings for VCA.",Is AF-2 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
163,"The beneficial effects of Acanthopanax divaricatus var. albeofructus (ADA) extracts have been assessed by mutagenic and anti-mutagenic activities by Ames test. Mutation of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98, TA 100, TA1535, TA1537, and Escherichia coli WP2 uvr A was assayed in duplicates by the procedure of Maron and Ames in the presence or absence of S9 mix. As a result, ADA extracts were not mutagenic for S. typhimurium strains TA 98, TA 100, TA1535, TA1537, and E. coli by the Ames assay. Anti-mutagenic activity was assayed by the Ames mutagenicity assay using histidine mutant of S. typhimurium strains TA 98 and TA 100, using the plate-incorporation method. 2-Aminoanthrancene (2-AA), 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (AF-2), and sodium azide (NaN(3)) were used as the mutagens. ADA extracts showed a strong anti-mutagenic activity against 2-AA-induced mutagenesis which requires liver-metabolizing enzymes, and the same extract exhibited inhibitory effects on AF-2 and NaN(3)-induced mutagenesis in the absence of liver-metabolizing enzymes. The data indicate that ADA extracts contain anti-mutagenic activities against typical mutagens. The anti-mutagenic property of ADA provides additional health supplemental value to the other claimed therapeutic properties of the plant.",Is AF-2 mutagenic for TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True

165,"The anti-genotoxic properties of tea leaf extracts were examined in a Salmonella umu-test. Seven non-fermented teas (green tea), one semi-fermented tea (oolong tea), two fermented teas (black tea and Chinese pu er tea) and two other teas were examined for their anti-genotoxic abilities and for their catechins contents. This was to study the relationship between catechins contents and anti-genotoxic activity of various tea leaf extracts. All types of tea extracts showed more potent suppressive effects against umu gene expression of the SOS response in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK 1002 induced by four nitroarenes (1-nitropyrene, 2-nitrofluorene, 3-nitrofluoranthene and a mixture of 1,6- and 1,8-dinitropyrene) rather than 4-NQO, AF-2 and MNNG. The anti-genotoxic effect of 12 tea leaf extracts on 1-NP, 2-NF, 3-NF and DNP decreased in the order: oolong tea (semi-fermented tea)>black tea (fermented tea)>sencha (non-fermented tea, an ordinary grade green tea)>tocyucya (other tea)>Chinese pu er tea (fermented tea). The amount of catechins (EGC, C, EGCG, EC and ECG) in various teas in decreasing order was non-fermented tea>semi-fermented tea>fermented tea>other tea. A remarkable feature was the effectiveness of black tea and Chinese pu er tea in suppressing the genotoxicity induced by nitroarenes, in spite of the fact that these fermented teas do not have high catechins contents. Statistical analysis showed that no significant (P<0.01) correlation was found between the anti-genotoxicity of tea extracts against nitroarenes and the catechins contents in tea leaf extracts. In further experiment, fractionation of sencha extract by HPLC revealed that anti-genotoxicity of the peak fraction corresponding to catechins accounted for <10% of the total anti-genotoxic activity of sencha extract against for 1-nitropyrene. These results suggest that catechins are not major components responsible for the anti-genotoxic effects of tea leaf extracts against direct-acting nitroarenes.",Is AF-2 mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
166,"Antimutagens from gaiyou (Artemisia argyi Levl. et Vant., Compositae) were examined. The methanol extract prepared from aerial parts of this plant strongly reduced the mutagenicity of 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), when Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was used in the presence of the rat liver microsomal fraction. The antimutagens were purified chromatographically while monitoring the antimutagenic activity against Trp-P-2 with a modified Ames test employing a plate method. This purification resulted in the isolation of four strong antimutagens, 5,7-dihydroxy-6,3',4'-trimethoxyflavone (eupatilin), 5, 7,4'-trihydroxy-6,3'-dimethoxyflavone (jaceosidin), 5,7, 4'-trihydroxyflavone (apigenin) and 5,7, 4'-trihydroxy-3'-methoxyflavone (chrysoeriol) from the methanol extract. These antimutagenic flavones exhibited strong antimutagenic activity against not only Trp-P-2 but also against other heterocyclic amines, such as 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4, 3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3, 8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-3-methyl-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (MeA(alpha)C) in S. typhimurium TA98. In contrast, they did not exhibit antimutagenic activity against benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO), 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 2-nitrofluorene (2-NF) or furylfuramide (AF-2) in S. typhimurium TA98, or B[a]P, 4-NQO, 2-NF, AF-2, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) or sodium azide (SA) in Salmonella typhimurium TA100, whereas they decreased the mutagenicity caused by aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) and 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA) in both of these tester strains. Regarding the structure-activity relationship, the tested flavones had distinct differences in the intensities of their antimutagenic activities according to the differences of their substitution patterns. Namely, the intensity of antimutagenic activities against Trp-P-2 decreased in the order of: 5,7,3',4'-tetrasubstituted flavones (IC(50): <0.1 mmol/plate), 5,7,4'-trisubstituted flavones (IC(50): 0.120-0.260 mmol/plate), 5,6,7,3',4'-pentasubstituted flavones (IC(50): 0.440-0. 772 mmol/plate). The four isolated flavones were also studied regarding their antimutagenic mechanisms with preincubation methods of the modified Ames test and emission spectroscopic analysis. The results suggested that all isolated flavones were desmutagens which directly inactivated Trp-P-2 or inhibited its metabolic activation.",Is AF-2 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

This study examines the anti-tumour effects of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) isolated from Aloe vera Linne, in human and animal cell lines. Its anti-mutagenic effects were examined using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains. Growth inhibition was specifically exerted by DEHP against three leukaemic cell lines at concentrations below 100 microg mL(-1). At 100 microg mL(-1) DEHP, K562, HL60 and U937 leukaemic cell lines showed growth inhibition of 95, 97 and 95%, respectively. DEHP exhibited an inhibitory activity of 74, 83 and 81%, respectively, in K562, HL60 and U937 cell lines at a concentration of 10 microg mL(-1). At a concentration of 1 microg mL(-1), DEHP exerted an inhibitory activity of 50, 51 and 52%, respectively, in K562, HL60 and U937. In a normal cell line, MDBK, DEHP exerted 30% growth inhibition at a concentration of 100 microg mL(-1), and showed no inhibitory activity at concentrations below 50 microg mL(-1). It was found that DEHP exerted anti-mutagenic activity in the Salmonella mutation assay. The number of mutant colonies of Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 upon exposure to AF-2 (0.2 microg/plate) decreased in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of different DEHP concentrations (decreasing to 90.4, 83.9, 75.4, 69.6 and 46.9%, respectively, for DEHP concentrations of 100, 50, 10, 5 and 1 microg/plate). In the case of Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100, DEHP reduced AF-2-induced mutagenicity at 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 microg/plate to 57.4, 77.5, 80.0, 89.0 and 91.5%, respectively. The isolated compound from Aloe vera Linne, DEHP, was considered to be the active principle responsible for anti-leukaemic and anti-mutagenic effects in-vitro.",Is AF-2 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
168,"Possible mutagenic and co-mutagenic effects of strong static magnetic fields were estimated using bacterial mutagenicity test. Mutagenic potential of static magnetic fields up to 5T (T:1T=10,000 G) was not detected by the bacterial mutagenicity test using four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537) and Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA either in the pre-incubation method or in the plate incorporation method. In the co-mutagenicity test, E. coli WP2 uvrA cells were treated with various chemical mutagens and were simultaneously exposed to a 2T or a 5T static magnetic field. Mutation rate in the exposed group was significantly higher than that in the non-exposed group when cells were treated with N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS), 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO), 2-amino-3-methyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) or 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (AF-2). The mutagenicity of 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA), 9-aminoacridine (9-AA), N4-aminocytidine and 2-acetoamidofluorene (2-AAF) was not affected by the magnetic field exposure. Possible mechanisms of the co-mutagenicity of magnetic fields are discussed.",Is AF-2 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
169,"We have developed a set of multipurpose tester strains (WP3101 to WP3106) derived from E. coli WP2uvrA for the detection and classification of mutagens. Six kinds of F' plasmid (lacI, lacZ, proAB+) in strains CC101-CC106, each of which carried a different lacZ allele, were transferred to a delta(lac-pro) derivative of WP2uvrA. Assays for transitions and transversions are based upon Lac+ reversion of a specific mutation located within the lacZ gene on an F' plasmid in strains WP3101-WP3106. In addition, the trpE65(ochre) allele in the same strains is available for Trp+ reversion assays. Using the new tester strains, we investigated the mutational specificities of various chemical mutagens. Base analog mutagens and alkylating mutagens induced specific types of base substitutions. G:C-->A:T transitions and G:C-->T:A transversions predominated in mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide. Only a slight increase in G:C-->T:A transversions was observed in cells treated with 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (AF-2), although the potent mutagenicity of AF-2 was detected in a concurrent Trp+ reversion assay in the same strain. Sodium azide, on the other hand, was negative in the Trp+ reversion assay but specifically induced G:C-->A:T transitions. Present finding suggested that target sites for AF-2- and azide-induced lesions may largely depend on sequence context.",Is AF-2 mutagenic for WP2uvrA strain?,True
170,"The antimutagenic effects of nine active compounds in the Chinese herbal medicine ""sho-saiko-to"" on mutagenesis induced by a direct-acting mutagen, 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (AF-2) were investigated in Salmonella typhimurium, strain TA100. The active compounds examined were classified into two major groups, saponins and flavonoids, the former comprising glycyrrhizin, saikosaponins a, c, and d, and ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg1, and the latter, baicalin, baicalein and wogonin. Saikosaponin a and ginsenoside Rb1 were found to reduce the mutagenicity of AF-2 significantly when applied post-AF-2-treatment in the Salmonella mutagenicity assay. Ginsenoside Rb1 also decreased the mutagenic activity of AF-2 in a simultaneous treatment protocol. The results indicate that saikosaponin a and ginsenoside Rb1 may enhance DNA repair, and ginsenoside Rb1 may also have the ability to inactivate the mutagenic activity of AF-2 directly. On the other hand, saikosaponin d and baicalin showed a slight enhancing effect. None of the compounds, except baicalein, showed any toxic effect on the test strain. These findings may be useful for the development of chemopreventive agents.",Is ginsenoside Rb1 mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
171,"Lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus Stapf) was extracted with 80% ethanol. The extract was not found to be mutagenic in the Salmonella mutation test with or without metabolic activation. However, the extract was found to possess antimutagenic properties towards chemical-induced mutation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. Mutagenicity of AFB1, Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2, Glu-P-1, Glu-P-2, IQ, MNNG and AF-2, was inhibited by the extract of lemon grass in a dose-dependent manner, but no effect was found on the mutagenic activity of benzo[a]pyrene.",Is AF-2 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
172,"Three kinds of spices (caraway, coriander and black pepper seeds) and a medicinal plant called 'tong tak' in Thai (Baliospermum axillar, a species of the spurge family) were fractionated into hot water, methanol and hexane extracts. These extracts were not mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 by the Ames assay. However, when the extracts were treated with nitrite, samples of the water and methanol extracts were mutagenic for strain TA100 without metabolic activation. The mutagenicity of the nitrite-treated methanol and hot water extracts of black pepper was highest (8380 and 22,200 His+ per 0.1 g of spice powder, respectively), and that of the nitrite-treated hot water extracts of caraway and tong tak was moderate. The hot water extracts were examined for their antimutagenic activity against mutagenicity induced by various carcinogens by the Ames assay, using the preincubation technique. The tested samples (equivalent to 1-2 mg of spice powder) reduced the mutagenicity induced by 2.7 nmole (397 ng) of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine by more than 84%, and that induced by dimethylnitrosamine (1.48 mg) or ICR-170 (10 ng) by 30-60%. However, they did not inhibit the mutagenic activity of 1-nitropyrene, 3-nitrofluoranthene, AF-2, methyl methanesulfonate, N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, 2-aminoanthracene, 2-acetylaminofluorene, benzo[a]pyrene or IQ.",Is caraway mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
173,"The mutagenicity of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and its derivatives was investigated by the Ames method using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 with or without S9 mix. The compounds were not mutagenic in either indicator strain at concentrations ranging from 50 to 330 micrograms/plate (SQ: 3,5,3',5'-tetra-tert-butylstilbenequinone; VI-III: unidentified), 500 micrograms/plate (BE: 3,5,3',5'-tetra-tert-4,4'-dihydroxy-1,2-diphenylethylene; VI: 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl-4-tert-butylperoxy-2,5-cyclohexadienone ; VI-I: unidentified; VI-II: 3-acetyl-2,5-di-tert-cyclopenta-2,4-dienone) and 1000 micrograms/plate (BHT). The antimutagenic effects of BHT and its derivatives on mutagenesis by chemical agents were investigated in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 and Escherichia coli WP-2 hcr-. VI-II suppressed the mutagenesis induced in TA98 and TA100 by 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (AF-2) and that induced in WP-2 hcr- by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) without decreasing cell viability. In WP-2 hcr-, the mutagenesis induced by AF-2 and ethyl methanesulfonate was also suppressed significantly. Mutations induced by methyl methanesulfonate were slightly inhibited. However, VI-II had no effect on the mutagenesis induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine.",Is BHT mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
174,"Crude extracts and partially purified as well as purified fractions were prepared from three Thai medicinal plants, namely, Acanthus ebracteatus Vahl, Plumbago indica Linn, and Rhinacanthus nasuthus Kurz, and then tested for their mutagenic and antimutagenic potentials using the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test. All fractions tested were not mutagenic toward either strain TA98 or TA100 whether tested in the presence or absence of S-9 mix. Interestingly, however, various fractions--especially those extracted by organic solvents such as petroleum ether, hexane, and chloroform, as well as some purified compounds from these plants--could strongly inhibit the mutagenicity of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), an indirect mutagen, when tested in the presence of S-9 mix but not that of 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (AF-2), which does not require metabolic activation for its mutagenicity. Furthermore, these fractions could markedly inhibit the activity of rat liver aniline hydroxylase, which is one of the cytochrome-P450-mediated reactions. These results therefore suggest that these Thai medicinal plants contain an antimutagen(s) which inhibits chemical mutagenesis by inhibiting the enzyme activities necessary for activation of indirect mutagens/carcinogens. Identification as well as anticarcinogenicity of purified compounds of these plants are being investigated in our laboratory.",Is Acanthus ebracteatus Vahl mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
175,"Mutagenicities of AF-2, MNNG, 4NQO, aflatoxin B1, benzo [a] pyrene and Trp-P-1, with or without metabolic activation, were inactivated by treatment with human saliva to a great extent in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium test strains TA98 and TA100. Mutagenic activities of quercetin, pyrolysates of beef, salmon and sodium glutamate, and condensate of cigarette smoke were also decreased to some extent by saliva treatment, but no significant effect was found on the activity of MMS and pyrolysate of polypeptone. These effects showed individual variations. The inhibition of AF-2 mutagenicity by saliva varied with temperature in TA100 but not in TA98 cultures. Boiled saliva inactivated AF-2 mutagenicity in TA98 to some extent but not in TA100 cultures. Inactivation of AF-2 mutagenicity by saliva treatment was completed within 30 sec. Complex mechanisms may be involved in the inactivation of mutagenicity of carcinogens by saliva, including biochemical reactions with enzymes, vitamins, etc. and/or adsorption with high molecular weight substances in saliva such as proteins, bacterial cells, mucous materials, etc.",Is saliva mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
176,"1-Hydroxymethylpyrene (HMP), a primary benzylic alcohol, and 4H-cyclopenta[def]chrysen-4-ol (OH-CPC), a secondary benzylic alcohol, were investigated for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium (reversion of the his- strain TA98) in the presence of various xenobiotic-metabolizing systems. In the direct test, HMP was inactive and OH-CPC was very weakly active. In the presence of NADPH-fortified postmitochondrial fraction from rat liver (S9/NADPH), no activation of OH-CPC was observed, whereas strong mutagenic effects were elicited by HMP. In the presence of cytosol and 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), both alcohols were activated to potent mutagens. For equal mutagenic effects, approximately 650-fold lower concentrations of HMP were required in the cytosol/PAPS-mediated assay than in the S9/NADPH-mediated assay. The cytosol/PAPS-mediated mutagenicity of both alcohols was 3- to 4-fold enhanced, when KCl (125 mM) was present during the exposure. The authentic chloromethylarenes, 1-chloromethylpyrene and 4-chloro-4H-cyclopenta[def]chrysene, showed very strong direct mutagenicity. These results, taken together with previous findings, indicate that both primary and secondary benzylic alcohols derived from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may be activated by sulfotransferases to electrophilic sulfuric acid esters, and by subsequent substitution reaction to further active species such as benzylic chlorides.",Is 1-Hydroxymethylpyrene mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
177,"An examination has been made of some of the parameters which can affect mutant numbers in the Salmonella/microsome assay. The type of minimal media plates used for the assay and the concentration of glucose-6-phosphate, one of the co-factors necessary for mono-oxygenase action, had no effect on mutant numbers. Increases in mutated bacteria resulted from the use of (1) log-phase bacteria, (2) higher NADP concentrations than those normally recommended, and (3) higher phosphate buffer concentrations. Six mutagens, i.e., 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF), 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine (3,3'-DCB), cyclophosphamide (CY), aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) and benzo[a]pyrene (BP), all requiring mono-oxygenase activation, were studied with two Salmonella typhimurium strains, TA98 and TA100, and liver preparations from rats given different inducing agent treatments using optimum conditions. Phenobarbitone induction was generally superior to Aroclor-1254 in converting these substrates to mutagens except for the polycyclic hydrocarbon substrates. A comparison of 3-methylcholanthrene, Aroclor-1254, beta-naphthoflavone or phenobarbitone as inducing agents revealed the first three of these to be equally effective in activating BP or 3MC to mutagens, whereas phenobarbitone was less active. Dual administration of 3-methylcholanthrene and phenobarbitone to rats did not result in an additive mutagenic effect using AAF, AFB1 or 3,3'-DCB as substrates, the numbers of mutant bacteria obtained being only equal to that seen with 3-methylcholanthrene alone. These differences were not due to there being different liver protein optima for the various inducing agent treatments. The foregoing results are discussed in relation to attempts to draw up a rigid protocol for mutagenicity testing.",Is CY mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
178,"Cyclophosphamide must be enzymatically activated to be either mutagenic or teratogenic. This activation is thought to be catalyzed by the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase system. To study the relationship between the mutagenic and teratogenic metabolites of cyclophosphamide, the mutagenicity and teratogenicity of this drug were compared after activation by rats pretreated with chemicals (phenobarbital and beta-naphthoflavone) inducing different cytochromes P-450. Activation of cyclophosphamide to mutagenic metabolites by enzyme fractions from rats on day 13 of gestation was measured with the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA1535. Teratogenicity was assessed in vivo by treatment of rats with cyclophosphamide on day 13 of gestation. Cyclophosphamide was activated to mutagenic metabolites to the same extent (on a tissue wet weight basis) by enzyme fractions from maternal liver, kidney and placenta, despite differences in cytochrome P-450 content. Fetal homogenates did not activate cyclophosphamide. Phenobarbital pretreatment increased the activation of cyclophosphamide to mutagenic metabolites by maternal liver microsomes 10-fold and liver cytochrome P-450 content 1.8 fold; however, this drug did not alter the activation of cyclophosphamide by maternal kidney, by placenta or by the fetus. Phenobarbital pretreatment increased the teratogenicity of cyclophosphamide in rats on day 13 of gestation (increased incidence of malformed embryos, decreased fetal weight). Pretreatment with beta-naphthoflavone did not induce liver cytochrome P-450 in the pregnant rat and did not change the activation of cyclophosphamide to mutagenic metabolites by liver, kidney, placenta or the fetus. Pretreatment with this polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon had no effect or decreased the teratogenicity of cyclophosphamide. Thus, these experiments suggest that the mother, rather than the fetus, is the site of activation of cyclophosphamide; after phenobarbital pretreatment the predominant site of cyclophosphamide activation is the maternal liver. There appears to be a correlation between the teratogenicity and mutagenicity of cyclophosphamide after induction of the cytochromes P-450.

180,"To ascertain the in vitro genotoxicity of danthron and its potential mechanism of action, we performed an Ames test, a cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay and a comet assay in Balb/c 3T3 cells. The Ames test revealed that danthron was mutagenic only toward Salmonella typhimurium strain TA102 in the presence of an exogenous metabolic activation system (S9 mix). Danthron (25, 50 and 100μg/ml) increased the frequencies of micronuclear cells with or without S9 mix, and the comet length, tail length and Olive tail moment in comet assays without S9 mix in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrated the in vitro genotoxicity of danthron and that 3T3 cells are capable of activating danthron. When NADP was replaced by NAD in the S9 mix, danthron remained mutagenic toward strain TA102. The addition of dicoumarol, a DT-diaphorase inhibitor, decreased the number of danthron-induced histidine revertants by 35-39%, indicating that DT-diaphorase is involved in the metabolic activation of danthron in the presence of NADH as an electron donor. In 3T3 cells, increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels as well as a reduction in GSH levels were induced by danthron in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that oxidative stress may be a major contributing pathway in the genotoxicity of danthron.",Is danthron mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True

182,"Incubation of rat liver cytosolic or microsomal fractions with chromium(VI) led to a dramatic decrease in chromium(VI) mutagenicity, as determined by the Ames Salmonella assay using the TA100 tester strain. The cytosol-dependent decrease in chromium(VI) mutagenicity was found to be counteracted in the presence of dicumarol, an inhibitor of the cytosolic enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (DT-diaphorase). In order to determine whether DT-diaphorase is a significant factor in enzymatic reduction of chromium(VI) in rat liver tissue, cytosolic and microsomal fractions were analyzed for NAD(P)H-dependent chromium (VI) reductase activity leading to chromium(V) formation by using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Reaction of chromium(VI) with NADH or NADPH in the presence of either cytosolic or microsomal fractions led to the formation of stable chromium(V)--NAD(P)H complexes. When glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) was present in the reaction as part of a NADPH-generating system, stable chromium(V)--G6P complexes were formed in addition to the chromium(V)--NAD(P)H complexes. The chromium(V) complexes had g values of 1.980-1.982 and superhyperfine splitting constants of 0.8-0.9 characteristic of bis(diol)oxochromium(V) complexes. Inhibition of 90% of the cytosolic DT-diaphorase activity by dicumarol led to only partial (20-22%) inhibition of chromium(V) formation. Visible and EPR spectroscopic studies showed that purified DT-diaphorase had no detectable chromium(VI) reductase activity and did not catalyze formation of chromium(V). Inhibition of 69% of microsomal aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity by ketoconazole led to partial (10%) inhibition of chromium(V) formation. These results indicate that intracellular NAD(P)H-dependent enzymatic reduction of chromium(VI) in rat liver cannot be attributed to the activity of any one enzyme in the cytosolic or microsomal fractions. DT-diaphorase appears to play an indirect role in decreasing chromium(VI)-induced mutagenicity in Salmonella, possibly through interaction with other redox active cellular components. The involvement of diols such as sugars and pyridine nucleotides in stabilizing intracellularly generated chromium(V) is discussed.",Is DT-diaphorase mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
183,"Urine samples from patients administered mutagenic antineoplastic drugs are mutagenic in the Ames assay, and hence may pose a genotoxic hazard to hospital personnel or family members caring for the patient. The urine samples in the present study were tested for mutagenicity in several strains of Salmonella typhimurium that were uvr negative (TA98, TA100) or positive (TA102, UTH8413, UTH8414), and were analyzed for the presence of drugs and their metabolites using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Urine samples from cancer patients were kept at room temperature and their mutagenicity as well as the chemical stability of the drugs was tested for a period of 14 days. It was observed that, in general, the urine remained mutagenic for the 14-day period while the parent compound degraded within the first seven days. An exception was cisplatin, which was chemically stable as platinum, but the urine decreased in mutagenicity with time. This decrease was probably the result of ligand exchange with the platinum. Inactivation methods were developed to reduce the genotoxic hazard posed by the mutagenic compounds in the urine. Cisplatin was inactivated by complexing with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC). Oxidation of urine containing mitomycin C and doxorubicin (sodium thiosulfate must be added to urine containing doxorubicin) with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution (bleach) results in mutagenic inactivation. Urine containing cyclophosphamide and its metabolites was oxidized with alkaline potassium permaganate and the active degradation products trapped with sodium thiosulfate. Both chemical and mutagenic assays are necessary to determine the reduction of risk. Methods of inactivation of mutagenic urine developed in this study are both effective and practical for the reduction of exposure to genotoxic hazards.",Is antineoplastic drugs mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
184,"A quantitative structure-activity relationship approach was used to investigate the mutagenicity of a series of seventeen-monosubstituted propylene oxides in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA1535. Mutagenicity in strain TA100, using a liquid suspension assay, was found to correlate with chemical reactivity, as measured by the rates of reaction with two model bionucleophiles, nicotinamide and 4-(4-nitrobenzyl)pyridine. However, since the reactivity of three of the epoxides did not correlate to their Taft sigma * values, as a measure of the electronic effects of substituent groups, neither was their mutagenicity predicted by this substituent constant. The relative mutagenicity for the propylene oxides was different in the liquid suspension assay than that determined by the standard plate incorporation assay and also differed between the two bacterial strains. The assay differences were attributed to epoxide stability. The differences between strains was observed to be due to the response of the error-prone repair system, found only in TA100, to the stronger alkylating agents.",Is nicotinamide mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
185,"N-Nitrodimethylamine, N-nitrodiethylamine, N-nitromorpholine and their N-nitroso analogs, N-nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosodiethylamine, and N-nitrosomorpholine, were tested in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA1530. The mutagenicity of all compounds, except N-nitrodiethylamine, was demonstrated in liquid incubation assays in at least one of the tester strains; it required the presence of a postmitochondrial supernatant from the liver of Aroclor-treated rats, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-generating system, and oxygen. When compared on a molar basis with their N-nitroso analogs, N-nitromorpholine was about 10 times less mutagenic and N-nitrodimethylamine about 70 times less mutagenic. Addition of disulfiram to the assays at a final concentration of 0.1 mM efficiently inhibited mutagenesis by all nitro and nitroso compounds; ascorbic acid at a 7.4 mM concentration produced less inhibition. Mutagenic activity of the three nitramines was also determined in the host-mediated assay in rats. After p.o. administration of each of the N-nitramines, cells of S. typhimurium strains TA1530 and TA100 that had been injected i.p. were isolated from the peritoneal liquid after 1, 3, and 6 hr. All three nitramines were found to be mutagenic for strain TA1530 but not for TA100. Mutation frequencies (number of histidine revertants per 10(6) surviving cells) were in the descending order N-nitromorpholine greater than N-nitrodiemethylamine greater than N-nitrodiethylamine. After a p.o. dose of N-nitrodiethylamine to rats, bacteria were also isolated from liver, lungs, and kidneys. Mutation frequency was highest in bacteria recovered from the liver but was not increased in those obtained from lungs and kidneys. The data suggest that carcinogenic nitramines exert their mutagenic effects through the formation of alkylating intermediates.",Is N-Nitrodimethylamine mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True

We examined diphenylcyclopropenone and diphenylacetylene, as well as synthetic precursors of diphenylcyclopropenone--dibenzylketone and alpha,alpha'-dibromodibenzylketone--for mutagenicity against TA100, TA98, TA102, UTH8413, and UTH8414. All compounds were nonmutagenic except alpha,alpha'-dibromodibenzylketone, which was a potent mutagen in TA100 with and without S-9 activation. The effect of photochemical activation of diphenylcyclopropenone in the presence of bacteria demonstrated mutagenicity in UTH8413 (two times background) at 10 micrograms/plate with S-9 microsomal activation. 8-Methoxypsoralen produces a mutagenic response in TA102 at 0.1 microgram/plate with 60 seconds of exposure to 350 nm light. In vitro photochemically activated Ames assay with S-9 microsomal fraction may enhance the trapping of short-lived photochemically produced high-energy mutagenic intermediates. This technique offers exciting opportunities to trap high-energy intermediates that may play an important role in mutagenesis. This method can be applied to a variety of topically applied dermatologic agents, potentially subjected to photochemical changes in normal use.",Is 8-Methoxypsoralen mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
189,"No carcinogenesis or mutagenesis studies have been carried out with etomidate. The current study showed that etomidate has weak cytotoxic potential after 48 h exposure in human lymphocytes and has no hemolytic activity. The weak cytotoxicity seems to be related with redox imbalance of etomidate (40.9 and 81.9 μM) treated lymphocytes. At both etomidate concentrations, a slight decrease of the levels of GSH intracellular content and a significant increase in the amount of carbonylated proteins were observed after 48 h. The contribution of oxidative stress to genetic toxicity was only perceived when the enzyme Fpg was applied in the comet assay. Etomidate (40.9 and 81.9 μM) is a weak generator of oxidative DNA damage in lymphocytes. These damages to DNA probably were repaired, since no DNA strand breaks were detected in the standard alkaline comet assay (in the presence or absence of hepatic S9 microsomal fraction) without Fpg. Also, no micronucleated lymphocytes or carrying chromosomal aberrations were observed. Finally, etomidate (2046.8 and 4093.5 μM) was not mutagenic in the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay, which used four Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA102) to detect frameshift and base-substitution mutations. In summary, etomidate is a weak oxidative DNA damaging anesthetic and is devoid of mutagenic properties in eukaryotic and prokaryotic models.",Is etomidate mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
190,"2-Nitroanisole (2-NA) is used in the manufacturing of azo dyes and causes cancer, mainly in the urinary bladder. Previous in vivo genotoxic data seems to be insufficient to explain the mechanism through which 2-NA induces carcinogenesis, and several bladder carcinogens were reported to induce oxidative DNA damage. Thus, we examined the potential induction of oxidative DNA damage by 2-NA using bacterial strain YG3008, a mutM ST -deficient derivative of strain TA100. Consequently, strain YG3008, when compared with strain TA100, was found to be more sensitive to 2-NA, indicating oxidative DNA damage in bacterial cells. For further investigation, we performed the comet assay using the urinary bladder and liver of rats, with and without human 8-oxoguanine DNA-glycosylase 1 (hOGG1), to confirm the potential of 2-NA for inducing oxidative DNA damage. Simultaneously, we conducted a micronucleus test using bone marrow from rats to assess the genotoxicity of 2-NA in vivo. 2-NA was administered orally to male Fischer 344 rats for 3 consecutive days. The rats were divided into 6 treatment groups: 3 groups treated with 2-NA at doses of 125, 250, and 500mg/kg; a group treated with the combination of 2-NA and glutathione-SH (GSH); a negative control group; and a positive control group. The comet assay without hOGG1 detected no DNA damage in the liver or urinary bladder, and the micronucleus test did not show clastogenic effects in bone marrow cells. However, the comet assay with hOGG1 was positive in the urinary bladder samples, indicating the induction of oxidative DNA damage in the urinary bladder for the group treated with 2-NA at 500mg/kg. Moreover, an antioxidant of GSH significantly reduced oxidative DNA damage caused by 2-NA. These results indicate that oxidative DNA damage is a possible mode of action for carcinogenesis in the urinary bladder of rats treated with 2-NA.",Is 2-NA mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
191,"In vitro cytotoxicity and genotoxicity induction by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) from maize (ME) and tortillas (TE) produced by microwave nixtamalization were investigated in monkey kidney (Vero cells) using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, the induction of lipid peroxidation, the oxidative damage by means of glutathione (GSH) depletion, and the Salmonella-microsomal screening system (Ames test). Our results showed that, at higher concentrations, both ME and TE extracts that contained varying amounts of aflatoxin caused a considerable decrease in Vero cell viability (up to 37%) after 4 h of exposure. Aflatoxins from ME induced greater oxidative damage by enhancing lipid peroxidation (up to 6.05 ± 0.14 μmol/mg protein) as compared to TE; however, TE also induced significant malondialdehyde formation in particular at the higher aflatoxin concentration tested (up to 2.7 ± 0.19 μmol/mg protein). The decrease in GSH level was also more pronounced in ME as compared to TE. Moreover, the Ames test results indicated that the mutagenic activity of TE was greatly reduced compared with that of ME based on his(-) → his(+) reversions in the Salmonella TA100 strain. According to these results, it is concluded that the microwave nixtamalization procedure reduced aflatoxins and their in vitro toxicity and mutagenic activity.",Is tortillas (TE) mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
192,"In this article, the genotoxic and antigenotoxic effects of methanol extract of of Cladonia foliacea (Huds.) Willd. (CME) were studied using WP2, Ames (TA1535 and TA1537), and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test systems. The results of our studies showed that 5 µM concentration of aflatoxin B1(AFB1) changed the frequencies of SCE and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. When 5 and 10 µg/mL concentrations of CME was added to AFB1, the frequencies of SCE and MDA level were decreased and SOD, GSH, and GPx levels were increased. The extract CME did not show any mutagenicity on Ames (Salmonella typhimurium TA1535, TA1537) and WP2 (Escherichia coli) test systems. On the other hand, CME has antimutagenicity on the mentioned test systems. The results of this experiment have clearly shown that CME has a significant antioxidative and antigenotoxic effect, which is thought to be due to the antigenotoxic activities of antioxidant enzymes.",Is CME mutagenic for TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
193,"To ascertain the in vitro genotoxicity of danthron and its potential mechanism of action, we performed an Ames test, a cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay and a comet assay in Balb/c 3T3 cells. The Ames test revealed that danthron was mutagenic only toward Salmonella typhimurium strain TA102 in the presence of an exogenous metabolic activation system (S9 mix). Danthron (25, 50 and 100μg/ml) increased the frequencies of micronuclear cells with or without S9 mix, and the comet length, tail length and Olive tail moment in comet assays without S9 mix in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrated the in vitro genotoxicity of danthron and that 3T3 cells are capable of activating danthron. When NADP was replaced by NAD in the S9 mix, danthron remained mutagenic toward strain TA102. The addition of dicoumarol, a DT-diaphorase inhibitor, decreased the number of danthron-induced histidine revertants by 35-39%, indicating that DT-diaphorase is involved in the metabolic activation of danthron in the presence of NADH as an electron donor. In 3T3 cells, increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels as well as a reduction in GSH levels were induced by danthron in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that oxidative stress may be a major contributing pathway in the genotoxicity of danthron.",Is danthron mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True
194,"In this study we investigated cytotoxic, mutagenic and genotoxic effects of different concentrations of wastewater from the phosphoric gypsum depot near the factory for fertilizing agents 'INA Petrokemija' (Kutina, Croatia). The Ames test was performed on Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains, in the presence of S9 mix, glutathione and buffer, respectively. Cytotoxicity was studied on human laryngeal carcinoma cells (HEp2) and human cervical cells (HeLa). The level of lipid peroxidation in these two cell lines was evaluated in parallel. To establish the levels of primary DNA damage, the alkaline comet assay was performed on treated human peripheral blood leukocytes. No mutagenic effects of phosphoric gypsum on Salmonella typhimurium strains in the presence of S9 mix, GSH or PBS were observed. However, strong cytotoxic effect was observed on both human cell lines when they were treated with different concentrations of wastewater. Lipid peroxidation was induced and increased by prolonged time of incubation, highlighting that the damage was not repaired, but increased with the time of incubation. The results of the alkaline comet assay indicate significant DNA damaging potential of wastewater for human leukocytes. Since phosphoric gypsum transport water in its present composition and acidity is highly toxic and acts as prooxidant, causing free radicals formation and DNA damage, urgent neutralization/purification of the wastewater to a level acceptable for disposal into the environment is mandatory.",Is GSH mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
195,"The antimutagenic activity of the methanolic extract of the fruiting bodies of Ganoderma lucidum (Fr.) P. Krast. occurring in South India was investigated. The activity was assayed by Ames Salmonella mutagenicity test using histidine mutants of Salmonella typhimurium tester strains, TA98, TA100 and TA102. The methanolic extract of the mushroom significantly inhibited (P<0.001) the in vitro sodium azide (NaN(3)), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD), and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) induced his(+) revertants in a dose dependent manner. In vivo antimutagenic activity of extract was also assayed by determining the mutagenicity of the urine of rats administrated with B[a]P as a mutagen. The prior administration of extract markedly inhibited mutagenicity induced by B[a]P. The results indicated that the methanolic extract of Ganoderma lucidum occurring in South India possessed significant antimutagenic activity. The effect of B[a]P on hepatic enzymes, such as serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and alkaline phosphtase (ALP), were also evaluated. The extract prevented the increase of SGOT, SGPT, and ALP activities consequent to B[a]P challenge, and enhanced the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). The extract also profoundly inhibited lipid peroxidation induced by B[a]P. The results revealed that Ganoderma lucidum extract restored antioxidant defense and prevented hepatic damage consequent to the challenge by B[a]P.",Is Ganoderma lucidum mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
196,"1,1-Dichloropropene (1,1-DCPe) is a contaminant of some source waters used to make drinking water. Because of this and the fact that no toxicological data were available for this compound, which is structurally similar to the rodent carcinogen 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-DCPe), 1,1-DCPe was placed on the Contaminant Candidate List of the US Environmental Protection Agency. Consequently, we have performed a hazard characterization of 1,1-DCPe by evaluating its mutagenicity in the Salmonella assay and its DNA damaging (comet assay) and apoptotic (caspase assay) activities in human lymphoblastoid cells. In Salmonella, 1,1-DCPe was not mutagenic in strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA104 +/-S9 mix. However, it was clearly mutagenic in strain RSJ100, which expresses the rat GSTT1-1 gene. 1,1-DCPe did not induce DNA damage in GSTT1-1-deficient human lymphoblastoid cells, and it induced apoptosis in these cells only at 5 mM. Consistent with its mutagenesis in RSJ100, 1,1-DCPe reacted with glutathione (GSH) in vitro, suggesting an addition-elimination mechanism to account for the detected GSH conjugate. 1,1-DCPe was approximately 5000 times more mutagenic than its ethene congener 1,1-dichloroethylene (1,1-DCE or vinylidene chloride). Neither 1,1-DCE nor 1,3-DCPe showed enhanced mutagenicity in strain RSJ100, indicating a lack of activation of these congeners by GSTT1-1. Thus, 1,1-DCPe is a base-substitution mutagen requiring activation by GSTT1-1, possibly involving the production of a reactive episulfonium ion. This bioactivation mechanism of 1,1-DCPe is different from that of its congeners 1,1-DCE and 1,3-DCPe. The presence of 1,1-DCPe in source waters could pose an ecological or human health risk. Occurrence data for 1,1-DCPe in finished drinking water are needed to estimate human exposure to, and possible health risks from, this mutagenic compound.","Is 1,1-DCPe mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?",False
197,"Halonitromethanes (HNMs) are a recently identified class of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking water. They include chloronitromethane (CHN), dichloronitromethane (DCNM), trichloronitromethane (TCNM), bromonitromethane (BNM), dibromonitromethane (DBNM), tribromonitromethane (TBNM), bromochloronitromethane (BCNM),dibromochloronitromethane (DBCNM), and bromodichloronitromethane (BDCNM). Previous studies of TCNM, DCNM, CNM, and TBNM found that all four were mutagenic in bacteria, and a recent study showed that all nine induced DNA damage in CHO cells. Here, all nine HNMs were evaluated in the Salmonella plate-incorporation assay +/- S9 using strains TA98, TA100, TA104, TPT100, and the glutathione transferase theta (GSTT1-1)-expressing strain RSJ100. All were mutagenic, most with and without S9. In the absence of S9, six were mutagenic in TA98, six in TA100, and three in TA104; in the presence of S9, these numbers were five, seven, and three, respectively. Thus, the HNMs-induced base substitutions primarily at GC sites as well as frameshifts. Although five HNMs were activated to mutagens in RSJ100 -S9, they produced < or =2-fold increases in revertants and potencies <506 rev/micromol. The rank order of the HNMs by mutagenic potency in TA100 +S9 was (BCNM DBNM) > (TBNM CNM > BNM DCNM BDCNM) > (TCNM = DBCNM). The mean rev/micromol for the three groupings, respectively, were 1423, 498, and 0, which classifies the HNMs as weak mutagens in Salmonella. Reaction of the dihalo and monohalo HNMs with GSH, possibly GSTT1-1, is a possible mechanism for formation of ultimate mutagenic products. Because the HNMs are mutagenic in Salmonella (present study) and potent clastogens in mammalian cells [Environ. Sci. Technol. 38 (2004) 62], their presence in drinking water warrants further research on their potential health effects.",Is HNMs mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
198,"S-nitrosoglutathine (GSNO) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were tested for mutagenicity against strain Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 in the Ames Standard plate incorporation assay. Neither GSNO not GSH were mutagenic when tested alone. In combination, the GSNO/GSH system induced a positive mutagenic response that ranged from 3 to 20 x over background at concentrations of 10 to 50 micromol (micromol)per plate, respectively. This mutagenic response can be attributable to the generation nitric oxide, among the many other reactive products generated by the reaction of GSNO with GSH.",Is GSH mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,False
199,"In this genotoxic study, the Ames Salmonella microsome test showed that an aqueous extract of betel quid did not induce mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. Mammalian cell studies (Chinese hamster ovary K1 cell; CHO-K1 cell) revealed that only higher concentrations (100 and 1000 microg/ml) of aqueous extract weekly increased the frequencies of sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) in the absence of S9. Animal (male Sprague-Dawley rat) studies showed that low-dose feeding (0.53 g dry aqueous extract/kg diet) significantly increased the activities of glutathione (GSH) peroxidase and cytoplasmic glutathione S-transferase (cGST) of liver, high-dose feeding (26.5 g dry aqueous extract/kg diet) lowered the contents of GSH and total glutathione. The effect of an aqueous extract of betel quid on the oxidation of 2'-deoxyguanosine (2'-dG) to 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) evaluated that this aqueous extract may act as a pro-oxidant at lower dosage and may be dependent on the iron ions in the model system. However, the aqueous extract of betel quid showed antioxidant activity at higher doses by the ability of the scavenging effect of the hydroxyl radicals.",Is betel quid mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
200,"Chloropicrin (CCl3NO2) is a major soil fumigant for control of fungi, insects and nematodes and may by formed by chlorination of drinking water. It is also a strong lacrimator and induces sister chromatid exchanges in cultured human lymphocytes. Mutagenicity assays of CCl3NO2 in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 establish that it is toxic but not mutagenic at 500 nmol/plate but becomes mutagenic but not toxic on addition of S9 (previous work) or 1-2 molar equivalents of glutathione (GSH) (this study). The preincubation assay is superior to the plate incorporation test giving 2-4-fold higher revertants/nmol. Using the preincubation assay with GSH at 5 mM (a biomimetic level) in the top agar gives linear dose-response relationships for CCl3NO2 and its dechlorination products CHCl2NO2 and CH2ClNO2 with 0.56, 0.56 and 1.8 revertants/nmol, respectively. The mutagenicity values for CHCl2NO2 and CH2ClNO2 are the same in the presence and the absence of GSH, which only improves the linearity at high levels by reducing toxicity to the bacteria. GSH activation of CCl3NO2 mutagenicity may be due to reductive dechlorination of the trichloro compound to the more active CHCl2NO2 and CH2ClNO2. Alternatively, the mutagenicity may result from an intermediate GSH conjugate such as GSCCl2NO2 or GSCHClNO2. In comparison, the mutagenicity of CH2Br2 and CH2I2 is affected little if any by addition of GSH and these dihalomethanes are much less active than the halonitromethane series. It therefore appears that CCl3NO2 is not mutagenic in the absence of activation and that the dechlorinated metabolites CHCl2NO2 and CH2ClNO2 are moderately potent bacterial mutagens, consistent with the possible genotoxicity of CCl3NO2 in mammals.",Is CCl3NO2 mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
201,"Trihalomethanes (THMs) are the most prevalent disinfection by-products identified in chlorinated drinking water. Among the THMs, chloroform (CHCl3) generally occurs at the highest concentration in finished water, but the concentrations of each of the brominated THMs (CHBrCl2, CHBr2Cl, and CHBr3) can exceed that of CHCl3. Each of these four THMs was carcinogenic in rodents in chronic oral dosing studies. This study assessed THM mutagenicity in a strain of Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 that was transfected with rat theta-class glutathione S-transferase T1-1 (+GST). The +GST strain and its nontransfected parent strain (-GST) were employed in a plate-incorporation assay and exposed for 24 hr to the vapor of individual THMs at concentrations up to 25,600 ppm in sealed Tedlar bags. Base-substitution revertants were produced in the +GST strain in a dose-dependent fashion by CHBrCl2 but not by CHCl3. At 4800 ppm CHBrCl2, which produced a calculated agar concentration of 0.67 mM, there were 419 +/- 75 revertants per plate compared to a spontaneous level of 23 +/- 5. CHCl3 produced a doubling of revertants only at the two highest concentrations tested (19,200 and 25,600 ppm). These results indicate that bromination of THMs confers the capability for theta-class GST-mediated transformation to mutagenic intermediates at low substrate concentrations, suggesting the possibility of a similar activation route in humans. Further, the very low affinity of the GSH-dependent pathway for CHCl3 demonstrates that different THMs can induce adverse effects via different mechanisms, indicating that risk evaluations of THMs should not treat members of this class as if they shared a common mode of action.",Is THMs mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
202,"In the previous study (Mutation Res., this issue), we showed that increased levels of dietary casein as the sole protein source for male F344 rats decreased the ability of the uninduced liver S9s to activate 2-aminoanthracene (2AN) to a mutagen in strain TA98 using the spiral Salmonella mutagenicity assay. No effects of dietary casein levels were noted for the ability of uninduced liver S9s to activate the promutagens aflatoxin B1 (AFB) and benzo[a]pyrene (BAP). In the present study, we have extended this study to include liver S9s induced with either Aroclor 1254, phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC). S9s were derived from individual male F344 rats fed for 6 weeks on semisynthetic diets containing 8%, 12% or 22% methionine-supplemented casein as the sole source of protein (diets were made isocaloric by adjusting the corn starch content). Rats were housed in large, raised-bed cages by groups of three/diet/inducing agent. S9 activation mixtures were prepared at 5 mg of S9 protein/ml of S9 mix. Slopes from the linear portions of the mutagenicity dose-response curves were analyzed by ANOVA comparisons. Assays used to elucidate the phase I activities of microsomal preparations were cytochrome P-450 content, cytochrome-c reductase activity, flavin-containing monooxygenase activity, 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation (EROD) activity, N-demethylation of benzphetamine, and para-nitrophenol O-deethylation. Phase II activities were assayed by estimating glutathione (GSH) content and measuring the metabolism of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) by glutathione S-transferase in cytosolic preparations. None of the phase I or phase II endpoints were significantly affected by dietary casein levels. In general, increasing levels of dietary casein resulted in increased body and liver wet weight and amount of S9 protein. Aroclor-induced S9s from rats fed the 22% or 12% casein diet were most effective at activating AFB, depending on the lot of Aroclor used for induction; these divergent results were replicated with two groups of rats for each lot of Aroclor. The observed differences between Aroclor lots are assumed to arise from variation in the mix of PCB isomers. The Aroclor-induced S9s did not exhibit any casein-related effects for the activation of BAP or 2AN. For 3MC-induced S9s, the 12% casein diets produced S9s with the highest ability to activate AFB and BAP when standardized for protein content. Phenobarbital-induced S9s did not demonstrate any dietary casein-related effects on the activation of the three model promutagens. These results illustrate the complex interaction between dietary levels of casein, enzyme inducing agent and promutagen.",Is 2-aminoanthracene mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
203,"A series of naturally occurring compounds were tested for the ability to modulate the mutagenicity induced by cigarette smoke (CS), cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) and benzo[a]pyrene (BP) in the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay and the micronucleus test in mouse bone marrow. Sodium selenite, retinol acetate and alpha-tocopherol significantly decreased the mutagenic activity of CS in Salmonella typhimurium TA98. Ascorbic acid, reduced glutathione (GSH), cysteine, caffeine, theophylline, cobalt chloride, folic acid, adenine, adenosine, guanosine, cytidine and cytosine were conversely devoid of any significant effect. Sodium selenite slightly decreased the mutagenic activity of CSC in the same bacterial strain, while caffeine was ineffective and ascorbic acid potentiated its mutagenicity. Ascorbic acid inhibited the mutagenic activity of BP in S. typhimurium TA98, but not in TA100. Retinol acetate diminished the number of BP-induced his+ revertants in TA98 but only at the highest concentrations used, whereas alpha-tocopherol, GSH, cysteine, sodium selenite and caffeine had no effect. Selenite and GSH, which were ineffective when applied individually, inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the BP-induced mutagenesis in S. typhimurium TA98 when simultaneously added to the top agar. All other combinations tested, including selenite plus either GSH, cysteine or caffeine towards CS or CSC, or selenite plus cysteine, or selenite plus retinol acetate and alpha-tocopherol towards BP, failed to produce interactive effects. Sodium selenite and caffeine, given either alone or in combination in drinking water, did not influence the clastogenesis induced in mouse bone marrow by a single treatment with CS or BP. Ascorbic acid was also ineffective towards CS clastogenicity but significantly decreased the number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes induced by BP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Is Ascorbic acid mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
204,"The mutagenic activity of captan and captafol was tested using Ames strains and strains showing an SOS response. Captafol was mutagenic in S. typhimurium strain TA102 (uvr+) and captan in strain TA104 (uvrB). Both captan and captafol elicit damages in DNA recognized by correndonuclease II, as shown by the repair test, and induced the SOS repair system in E. coli PQ37 (uvrA) strain. Only captafol induced the SOS system in PQ35 (uvr+). The lack of induction of beta-galactosidase at nonpermissive temperature in E. coli MD332 (dnaCs uvrA) strain showed that neither chemical was able to produce DNA breaks. In V79 Chinese hamster fibroblasts higher induction of c-mitosis by captafol than by captan (22% and 15% over the control, respectively) was accompanied by a higher decrease in nonprotein sulfhydryl groups, mainly GSH (41% and 77%, respectively). The content of protein sulfhydryl groups was decreased by either fungicide to a similar extent.",Is Captafol mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True
205,"The major DNA adduct (greater than 95% total) resulting from the bioactivation of ethylene dibromide by conjugation with GSH is S-(2-(N7-guanyl)ethyl)GSH. The mutagenic potential of this adduct has been uncertain, however, because the observed mutagenicity might be caused by other adducts present at much lower levels, e.g. S-(2-N1-adenyl)ethyl)GSH. To assess the formation of other potential adducts, S-(2-(N3-deoxycytidyl)ethyl)GSH, S-(2-(O6-deoxyguanosyl)ethyl)GSH, and S-(2-(N2-deoxyguanosyl)ethyl)GSH were prepared and used as standards in the analysis of calf thymus DNA modified by treatment with [1,2-14C]ethylene dibromide and GSH in the presence of rat liver cytosol; only minor amounts (less than 0.2%) were found. A forward mutation assay in (repair-deficient) Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and sequence analysis were utilized to determine the type, site, and frequency of mutations in a portion of the lacZ gene resulting from in vitro modification of bacteriophage M13mp18 DNA with S-(2-chloroethyl)GSH, an analog of the ethylene dibromide-GSH conjugate. An adduct level of approximately 8 nmol (mg DNA)-1 resulted in a 10-fold increase in mutation frequency relative to the spontaneous level. The spectrum of spontaneous mutations was quite varied, but the spectrum of S-(2-chloroethyl)GSH-induced mutations consisted primarily of base substitutions of which G:C to A:T transitions accounted for 75% (70% of the total mutations). All available evidence implicates S-(2-(N7-guanyl)ethyl)GSH as the cause of these mutations inasmuch as the levels of the minor adducts are not consistent with the mutation frequency observed in this system. The sequence selectivity of alkylation was determined by treatment of end-labeled lac DNA fragments with S-(2-chloroethyl)GSH, cleavage of the DNA at adduct sites, and electrophoretic analysis. Comparison of the sequence selectivity with the mutation spectrum revealed no obligate relationship between the extent of adduct formation and the number of mutations which resulted at different sites. We suggest that the mechanism of mutagenesis involves DNA sequence-dependent alterations in the interaction of the polymerase with the (modified) template and incoming nucleotide.",Is GSH mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
206,"The mutagenic activities of several structurally related dibromo compounds were compared in Salmonella strains sensitive to base substitution mutagenesis (TA1535 and/or TA100) and in the glutathione (GSH)-deficient derivative TA100/NG-57, using a preincubation procedure. The compounds tested were 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE), 1,2-dibromopropane (DBP), 1,2-dibromo-1-phenylethane (DBPE) and model compounds for the half-mustards resulting from their conjugation with GSH, i.e. the N-acetyl-S-2-bromoalkyl-L-cysteine methyl esters SBE, SBP, and SBPE, respectively. The alkylating potential of all compounds was assayed with the 4-(p-nitrobenzyl)pyridine (NBP) alkylation test. Five of the compounds showed a good correlation between relative mutagenic activity in TA100 and electrophilic reactivity in the NBP-test, the order of decreasing potency being SBE greater than SBP greater than DBPE greater than DBP. SBPE displayed the highest reactivity in the NBP-test, but was devoid of mutagenic activity. The mutagenic activity of DBE was substantially decreased in the GSH-deficient strain TA100/NG-57 and could be restored by pretreating the cells with GSH. None of the other chemicals showed different mutagenic activities in TA100 and TA100/NG-57. From the results it can be concluded that 2-bromothioethers possess higher alkylating activities than the 1,2-dibromo compounds. Methyl substitution has a deactivating effect on the mutagenic activity. The results with the phenyl-substituted analogue, DBPE, show that a higher alkylating activity does not always lead to a higher mutagenic activity.","Is 1,2-dibromopropane mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?",True
207,"The effects of glutathione (GSH) and the combination of GSH and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) on aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) mutagenesis in the Salmonella mutagenicity assay using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 were tested. Ten concentrations of AFB1 (0-1.0 micrograms/plate) were added to a liver microsomal homogenate (S9 mix) or to S9 mix containing GSH or S9 mix containing the combination of GSH + GST. One-third of the samples were plated directly. Two-thirds were incubated for 30 min at 37 degrees C prior to plating, and of those, half included bacteria. All samples were plated according to Ames et al [1975]. The results show that the addition of GSH and GSH + GST affected AFB1 mutagenesis by forming the AFB1-GSH conjugate and decreasing the availability of AFB1-8,9-epoxide. The effect of GST on GSH activity varied with the strain because of the different amounts of S9 mix used. The formation of the AFB1-GSH conjugate was verified by using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography for quantitation of AFB1 and detection of AFB1-GSH.",Is GSH mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
208,"Several mutants with decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were isolated from the sensitive mutagen tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA100 after treatment with u.v. and selection for resistance to N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG) and its methyl analogue MNNG. Estimation of the GSH concentration and GSH S-transferase activity in extracts of these strains and of TA100 indicates that the GSH- derivatives contain 10-30% of the GSH level found in TA100, and that they exhibit normal GSH S-transferase activity. The mutagenic activities of 7 chemicals, namely, MNNG, ENNG, 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE), 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), styrene-7,8-oxide (STOX), N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) were compared in TA100 and in one representative GSH- strain, denominated NG-57. MNNG, ENNG, DBE and CDNB are potent to extremely potent mutagens in TA100, but induce very low levels of His+ mutants in NG-57. Pretreatment of NG-57 with 1 mM GSH (partially) restores the mutant yields to the levels usually found in TA100. The mutagenic activities of STOX, ENU and MMS are similar in both strains. These results support some previous findings, namely that ENNG, MNNG and DBE, but not ENU are activated to mutagens inside the test bacteria, and also suggest that CDNB is activated by bacterial GSH. The latter finding is in contrast with the current view that CDNB is detoxified by GSH, as is also presently evidenced by a strong reduction of the compound's mutagenicity in the presence of extracts of rat liver, which contains GSH and GSH S-transferase activity. The results with STOX indicate that GSH plays in bacteria a much less important role in the detoxification of xenobiotics than in mammalian tissue, presumably due to a much lower GSH S-transferase activity in the first organism.",Is ENNG mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
209,"The Z(cis)- and E(trans)-isomers of 1,3-dichloropropene (DCP), in confirmation of previous reports, caused dose-dependent increases in the numbers of reverse mutations in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 in the presence and absence of a 9000 X g supernatant fraction (S9) from the livers of Aroclor-treated rats. The relevance of these findings to mammals is uncertain, not least because of major differences in the metabolism of the DCPs in the microbial assay systems and in vivo. For example, (Z)-DCP is efficiently detoxified in mammals by the operation of a glutathione (GSH)-dependent S-alkyl transferase. It is possible that such detoxification could proceed only very slowly in the microbial assays because the concentrations of GSH could be severely rate-limiting even in those assays fortified by the addition of S9. The results obtained in the current study demonstrate a dramatic reduction in the microbial mutagenicity of both (Z)- and (E)-DCP when the concentration of GSH in the microbial assays was adjusted to a normal physiological concentration (5 mM). However, this protective action of GSH was at least as effective in the absence of S9 as in its presence, suggesting that it was not mediated by mammalian GSH transferase. There appears to be little or no GSH alkyl or aryl transferase in the cytosol of S. typhimurium TA100, but intracellular GSH is present at a concentration similar to that found in mammalian cells. Since the uncatalysed reaction between the DCPs and glutathione is relatively slow, the effect is not due simply to their destruction by GSH. It is possible that a physiological concentration of extracellular GSH maintains the intracellular GSH in a reduced form in which its nucleophilic thiol group competes effectively with the nucleophilic centres in the bacterial DNA for the haloalkenes. The current results highlight the efficiency of GSH-linked systems in affording protection against the genotoxic action of the DCPs. It may be presumed that their operation would exert a major limiting effect on the genotoxicity of (Z)- and (E)-DCP in mammals.","Is 1,3-dichloropropene mutagenic for TA100 strain?",True
210,"N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione were negative in the Ames test with 7 Salmonella strains, while L-cysteine was activated by rat liver S-9 fractions to metabolites mutagenic to strains TA102, TA97 and TA100. The mutagenic response in S. typhimurium strains (TA1535, TA98, TA100, TA102) and the levels of enzyme activities, responsible for NADP+ or GSSG reduction and for the utilization of NADPH or GSH in rat liver S-9 fractions, were investigated following in vitro preincubation of NAC with four direct-acting mutagens and six procarcinogens. Treatment with this nucleophilic and reducing compound resulted in a dose-related decrease of the direct mutagenicity of epichlorohydrin, hydrogen peroxide and, sharply, of 4-nitroquinolino-N-oxide and sodium dichromate. The mutagenicity of these compounds, both in the absence and in the presence of NAC, was decreased by rat liver S-9 fractions and to some extent by lung S-9 fractions. A diphasic effect was observed in the case of procarcinogens (cyclophosphamide, 2-aminofluorene, cigarette smoke condensate, Trp-P-2, aflatoxin B1 and benzo[a]pyrene), i.e., an enhancement of S-9 requiring mutagenicity at intermediate NAC doses, which could be ascribed to metabolic factors acting in vitro, and a loss of mutagenicity at high NAC doses, which could be ascribed to trapping of electrophilic metabolites. Out of the five S-9 enzyme activities under study, i.e., glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, GSH peroxidase and GSSG reductase, only the last one showed significant changes following mutagen and/or NAC treatment.",Is GSH mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 strain?,False
211,"The mutagenic and carcinogenic aromatic amine, benzidine (BZ), underwent extensive biotransformation in the rat. Three days after po (5.0 mg/kg) or iv (2.5 mg/kg administration of [14C]BZ, 90% of the radiolabel had been excreted in the urine (25%) and feces (65%); 7% was recovered in the animal. As the dose was increased from 0.5 to 50 mg/kg, the percentage of the dose excreted in urine increased twofold. In distribution studies, a major portion of the iv dose accumulated in the intestinal tract due to the excretion of 71% of the administered radiolabel in bile. The liver, which is a primary target organ of BZ carcinogenicity in rats, contained a higher concentration of radiolabel than other tissues studied. A minimum of 17 urinary and/or biliary metabolites were separated by HPLC. The major metabolites were N-acetyl-BZ(ABZ), N,N'-diacetyl-BZ(DABZ), BZ-N-glucuronide, ABZ-glucuronide, N-OH-DABZ glucuronide, 3-OH-DABZ glucuronide, and a glutathione conjugate of DABZ (3-GSH-DABZ). At low doses (0.5 to 5 mg/kg), 3-OH-DABZ glucuronide, 3-GSH-DABZ, and DABZ were the major urinary or biliary metabolites. However, at higher doses (50 mg/kg), N-OH-DABZ glucuronide, which was a minor metabolite at low doses, became a major urinary and biliary metabolite. Several urinary and biliary metabolites displayed significant mutagenicity in the Salmonella typhimurium (strain TA98)-liver S9-beta-glucuronidase assay. However, N-OH-DABZ glucuronide exhibited a mutagenic potency 10X greater than the other urinary metabolites. Results of these studies demonstrate that BZ is rapidly metabolized via N-acetylation, N-hydroxylation, and aromatic hydroxylation to a variety of mutagenic metabolites which are excreted in urine or bile primarily as glucuronide and/or glutathione conjugates. The most potent mutagen studied was also a major urinary and biliary metabolite.",Is N-OH-DABZ glucuronide mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
212,"Levels of the tripeptide glutathione (GSH) and the activity of glutathione S-transferases were investigated in S9 fractions of rats and mice and in Salmonella typhymurium tester strains TA1535, TA100, TA1538 and TA98. The S9 and Salmonella typhimurium tester strains had high levels of glutathione. Compared with S9, the activity of GSH S-transferases was lower in the bacteria. However, electrophiles such as 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), diethyl maleate and styrene oxide were effectively bound to bacterial GSH. The mutagenicity of the direct mutagen CDNB was drastically lowered in presence of S9 fractions but not in presence of microsomes. A comparable decrease was obtained when microsomal supernatant, which contains GSH and GSH S-transferases, was added to the microsomes. Addition of GSH in excess completely abolished mutagenicity of CDNB. These results demonstrate that the conjugation of electrophiles with GSH mediated by the S9 fraction or the bacterial tester strains represents an important detoxication mechanism which may influence the results obtained with the Salmonella typhimurium mammalian-microsome mutagenicity test.",Is GSH mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
213,"Recently we have shown that Salmonella typhimurium tester strains have high levels of the tripeptide glutathione (GSH) and activity of GSH S-transferases (Summer et al., 1979). In continuation of the GSH-dependent suppression of mutagenicity of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene in presence of S9 fraction (Summer et al., 1979), this paper is focused on the GSH-dependent detoxifying capacity of the bacterial tester strains. 1-Fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (FDNB), an electrophilic agent, which is used to identify terminal amino acids in proteins (Sanger reagent), readily reacts with GSH leading to a dose-dependent  depletion of bacterial GSH. Additionally, FDNB is a strong mutagen for Salmonella typhimurium TA100, TA1538, and TA98 without metabolic activation. Presumably owing to conjugation with bacterial GHS, FDNB in concentrations which were lower or equal to those of bacterial GSH were found to be not mutagenic. Accordingly, increasing amounts of bacteria in the test system require increasing amounts of FDNB for expression of mutagenicity.",Is GSH mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
214,"Monochloramine has been suggested as an alternative disinfectant to chlorine to reduce levels of trihalomethanes in treated drinking water, but little is known of the toxicological properties and potential health implications of by-products specific to the chloramination process. Model aqueous fulvic acid solutions (200-400 mg C/liter), serving as surrogates for humic surface waters, were chloraminated over a range of molar Cl:C ratios from 1:40 to 1:2. The resulting by-products were extracted into diethyl ether at pH 2 and investigated with the Ames plate incorporation assay. Extractable mutagenicity increased with increasing chlorine and carbon dose up to about 30,000 revertants/liter at Cl:C ratios of 1:2. Mutagenicity was higher in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 than in strain TA98, and was decreased in the presence of S9, indicating that the mutagens formed were direct-acting and induced predominantly base-pair substitutions. Bovine serum albumin decreased slightly, and glutathione reduced greatly, the mutagenic activity detected in extracts. HPLC fractionation of the by-products indicated that most of the mutagenic activity was found in the earliest-eluting (most polar) fraction. The mutagenic by-products appeared to be qualitatively similar to 3-chloro-4-dichloromethyl-5-hydroxy-2-(5H)-furanone (MX) in their chromatographic behavior and responses to glutathione and bovine serum albumin, but were less readily detoxified by S9 than was MX.",Is glutathione mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
215,"Chemoprevention is an important alternative approach to control cancer. Chemical substances with multiple inhibitory properties would be a welcome addition to the class of chemopreventive drugs. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic and cancer preventive activities of aqueous extract of a macrofungus Phellinus rimosus (Berk) Pilat. The extract exhibited superoxide anion (O2-), hydroxyl radical (*OH), nitric oxide (NO*) scavenging and lipid peroxidation inhibiting activities. The inhibitory concentrations required by the extract to scavenge 50% (IC50) of the superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical and nitric oxide generated were 126 +/- 5.1, 71 +/- 4.7 and 31 +/- 4.5 microg/ml respectively. The concentration required to inhibit 50% of Fe2+ induced lipid peroxidation in rat liver homogenate was 318 +/- 2.4 microg/ml. The extract showed significant (P<0.05) anti-inflammatory activity in a dose dependent manner. Extract (100 mg/kg body wt, p.o) inhibited 44.5, 45.4 and 47% carrageenen, dextran and formalin induced inflammations respectively. The antimutagenic activity was determined by the Ames' Salmonella mutagenecity assay using histidine mutant Salmonella typhimurium strains. The extract at concentration of 5 mg/plate showed antimutagenecity against benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and 4-nitro-o-pheneylenediamine (NPDA) induced mutations of TA98 and TA100 respectively. Anticarcinogenic activity was evaluated using N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in rats. Serum gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities and lipid peroxidation level (MDA) were elevated significantly (P<0.05) in the NDEA alone treated group of animals. Treatment of the extract (25 and 50 mg/kg body wt, p.o.) prior to the NDEA administration decreased the serum GGT, GOT, GPT and ALP activities and MDA level in a dose dependent manner. The NDEA alone treated animals showed altered serum albumin/globulin ratio (A:G ratio), hyperfibrinogenaemia, increased hepatic glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, glutathione-peroxidsae (GPx) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) level compared to the extract plus NDEA treated group. The extract also inhibited in vitro aniline hydroxylase (AH) activity of rat liver induced by phenobarbitone in a dose dependent manner. The results, thus suggest the significant chemopreventive properties of the aqueous extract of the Phellinus rimosus against NDEA induced hepatocellular carcinoma by its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimutagenic activities.",Is Phellinus rimosus mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
216,"The antimutagenic activity of the methanolic extract of the fruiting bodies of Ganoderma lucidum (Fr.) P. Krast. occurring in South India was investigated. The activity was assayed by Ames Salmonella mutagenicity test using histidine mutants of Salmonella typhimurium tester strains, TA98, TA100 and TA102. The methanolic extract of the mushroom significantly inhibited (P<0.001) the in vitro sodium azide (NaN(3)), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD), and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) induced his(+) revertants in a dose dependent manner. In vivo antimutagenic activity of extract was also assayed by determining the mutagenicity of the urine of rats administrated with B[a]P as a mutagen. The prior administration of extract markedly inhibited mutagenicity induced by B[a]P. The results indicated that the methanolic extract of Ganoderma lucidum occurring in South India possessed significant antimutagenic activity. The effect of B[a]P on hepatic enzymes, such as serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and alkaline phosphtase (ALP), were also evaluated. The extract prevented the increase of SGOT, SGPT, and ALP activities consequent to B[a]P challenge, and enhanced the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). The extract also profoundly inhibited lipid peroxidation induced by B[a]P.

219,"Recently, mutagenic activity on several strains of Salmonella typhimurium has been found in many heat-processed foodstuffs. The previously reported direct-acting mutagenic activity of coffee in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 (Ames assay) was confirmed in our study. In addition to TA100, a mutagenic effect of coffee was also found by using the newly developed strain TA102. The mutagenic activity was abolished by the addition of rat-liver homogenate. 10% S9 mix completely eliminated the mutagenic activity of 30 mg of coffee per plate. The addition of reduced glutathione to active S9 further decreased the mutagenic activity and also reduced the mutagenicity together with inactivated S9. The compound or compounds responsible for this inactivation are heat-labile and seem to be located in the cytosol fraction of the S9. Part of the mutagenicity of coffee was also lost spontaneously upon incubation at temperatures between 0 degrees and 50 degrees C. The loss of activity was dependent on temperature, being more pronounced at 50 degrees C compared to 0 degrees C (at 50 degrees C approximately 50% of the mutagenic activity was lost after 6 h). As anaerobic conditions prevented this loss of mutagenicity almost totally, oxidative processes are probably responsible for the inactivation. The stability of the mutagen was not influenced by incubation at low pH values (pH 1-3), with or without the addition of pepsinogen. The mutagenic properties of methylglyoxal, which to some extent could be responsible for the mutagenic activity of coffee, were compared with those of coffee. Methylglyoxal was strongly mutagenic towards Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA102. Its mutagenic activity was partially inactivated by the addition of 10% S9. Glyoxalase I and II together with reduced glutathione abolished the mutagenic activity of methylglyoxal but reduced the mutagenicity of coffee by only 80%. Since these enzymes occur in mammalian cells, the mutagenic compound(s) of coffee could also be degraded in vivo. This conclusion is supported by the fact that a long-term carcinogenicity study with rats was negative. These results clearly demonstrate that the effects observed in vitro do not necessarily also occur in vivo, but that in vitro experiments may contribute to the understanding of fundamental mechanisms of chemical carcinogenesis.",Is reduced glutathione mutagenic for TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
220,"Pyranocoumarins are compounds with an important pharmacological profile, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cytotoxic, antiviral, antibacterial, and hypoglycemic effects. These molecules have a widespread presence as secondary metabolites in medicinal plants used to treat Diabetes Mellitus (DM). The aim of this work was to evaluate antidiabetic activity in Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and the antioxidant effects of 3',4'-Di-O-acetyl-cis-khellactone (DOAcK), as well as its toxic potential. We obtained DOAcK with an enantiomeric excess of 70% by chemical synthesis. Our results showed that this compound exerts an important antidiabetic effect: blood glucose decreased in groups treated with DOAcK by 60.9% at dose of 15mg/kg (p<0.05) compared with the diabetic control group, and demonstrated a statistically significant increase in weight gain (45.7±9.7 in the group treated with DOAcK vs. -23.0±33.1 in the group with diabetes). In a biochemical profile, DOAcK did not modify lipid metabolism and did not cause damage at the renal level. DOAcK administration increased the activities of Catalase (CAT), Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), and Super Oxide Dismutase (SOD) to levels near those of the healthy group. Histopathological analysis exhibited morphology similar to that of the healthy group and the group treated with DOAcK. DOAcK is not mutagenic by Ames test for Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, or TA102, and is not genotoxic by Micronucleus assay; median lethal dose (LD50) >2000mg/kg and, at this dose, no signs of toxicity or death were reported after 14days of observation. These results indicate that DOAcK can improve glucose metabolism, which may be due to the increased antioxidant activity of CAT, GPx and SOD. In addition, DOAcK is not toxic in the studies tested.",Is DOAcK mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
221,"Glutathione is activated to a mutagen by gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Other thiols, such as cysteine, penicillamine, cysteine ethylester, and cysteinylglycine, are direct mutagens in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity test. Thiol mutagenesis is oxidative in nature and involves H2O2 and possibly hydroxyl radicals. Transition metals are crucial for thiol autoxidation. The role of copper and ceruloplasmin (CP) in thiol-dependent mutagenesis was studied in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA102. Cu and CP at low concentrations enhanced thiol-dependent mutagenesis in the presence, but not in the absence, of added Fe. The degree of enhancement depended on the type of thiol. At high Cu or CP concentrations, thiol mutagenesis was inhibited. Cu also decreased the mutagenicity of H2O2. Cu- and CP-enhanced mutagenesis were inhibited by radical scavengers, catalase, and peroxidase but not by superoxide dismutase. The effects of Cu and CP on thiol-dependent mutagenesis were similar to their effects on thiol-driven lipid peroxidation. The results indicate that the role of Cu and CP in the enhancement of thiol mutagenesis is the facilitation of the transfer of electrons from a thiol to iron, rather than in catalysis of the Fenton reaction.",Is penicillamine mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True

Protection against mutagenicity of CHMA was mediated by glutathione and was partially dependent on glutathione S-transferase activity. 3. In contrast to the above findings, CHMA showed lower mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli strains of bacteria that are deficient in glutathione compared to their mutagenicity in parental (glutathione-rich) bacterial strains. 4.

223,"Glutathione and L-cysteine, in the presence of rat kidney post-mitochondrial supernatant (S9) fraction, and various forms of active oxygen were investigated for mutagenicity in seven his- strains of Salmonella typhimurium. Glutathione and L-cysteine showed qualitatively and quantitatively virtually identical mutagenic activities. The number of mutants induced in strain TA97 was 3-4 times higher than in TA100, the strain in which the mutagenicity was originally detected. Mutagenic effects were also observed in strains TA92, TA102 and TA104, but not in TA1535 and TA1537. Hydrogen peroxide, superoxide and glucose/glucose oxidase in the presence and absence of kidney S9 fraction showed pronounced mutagenic effects in strains TA104 and TA102. Additionally, weak mutagenic effects were observed in TA100, while the remaining strains, including TA97, were not responsive. These mutagenicity spectra suggest that the mutagenic species formed from glutathione and L-cysteine are similar, if not identical, and are different from hydrogen peroxide, superoxide and other oxygen species derived from them. Further support for this notion was given when it was observed that catalase did not affect the mutagenicity of glutathione and that superoxide dismutase showed a significant effect only when used in milligram quantities. This study shows that mutagenicity spectra may be useful in the elucidation of activation pathways. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that all the compounds and preparations showing a positive response in the Ames test in the present study occur endogenously in organisms: glutathione, L-cysteine, hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, glucose, glucose oxidase and kidney S9 fraction (which was mutagenic in several strains).",Is Glutathione mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 or TA1537 strain?,True
224,"Apomorphine, N-nor-N-propyl-apomorphine, dopamine, L-DOPA, 6-hydroxydopamine and adrenaline were evaluated for genotoxicity using the Ames test and DNA repair-deficient and DNA repair-proficient Bacillus subtilis strains (rec assay, H17/M45; HLL3g/HJ-15). In the absence of an S9 liver homogenate, apomorphine induced frame-shift mutations in Salmonella typhimurium, mainly in strain TA1537; no indication of DNA-damaging effects in B. subtilis was observed. N-Nor-N-propyl-apomorphine was tested using strain TA1537 only and found to be mutagenic. Dopamine, L-DOPA, 6-hydroxydopamine and adrenaline were non-mutagenic when tested without S9, whereas they were all more toxic for DNA repair-deficient than for DNA repair-proficient B. subtilis strains, indicating a DNA-damaging potential. In a second set of experiments the mode of action of apomorphine and the relevance of the positive Ames test data were investigated. Glutathione in physiological concentrations reduced the mutagenic effect of apomorphine in a dose-dependent way, both in the presence and the absence of S9. S9 also reduced the mutagenicity of apomorphine. By comparing the effects of a complete S9 mix with those of a preparation without glucose-6-phosphate and NADP, it became clear that S9 also had an activating effect, overshadowed under standard conditions by its deactivating activity. Apomorphine was not mutagenic under anaerobic conditions. Superoxide dismutase and catalase reduced the mutagenic effect of apomorphine. All test conditions which reduced the mutagenic effect also inhibited the dark discoloration of the tester plates, indicating a retardation of apomorphine oxidation. It can, therefore, be concluded that oxidation of apomorphine leads to mutagenic products which induce frame-shift mutations in Salmonella typhimurium. This oxidation was prevented both by glutathione in concentrations well below physiological levels and/or by catalase and superoxide dismutase. Under these conditions, apomorphine was non-mutagenic in therapeutic concentrations as well as at higher dose levels. The possibility of genotoxic side effects occurring in patients treated with apomorphine as an emetic drug is therefore considered to be very unlikely.",Is glutathione mutagenic for TA1537 strain?,False
225,"Four glutathione transferases (EC 2.5.1.18), glutathione transferases A, B, and C and a hitherto unknown form, termed X, were purified to apparent homogeneity from rat liver cytosol. They were investigated for their abilities to inactivate two mutagenic epoxides derived from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benz(a)anthracene, the K-region epoxide benz(a)anthracene 5,6-oxide and the diol-epoxide r-8,t-9-dihydroxy-t-10,11-oxy-8,9,10, 11-tetrahydrobenz(a)anthracene. Mutagenic activity was determined using Salmonella typhimurium his- strain TA100. Glutathione alone had little if any influence on the mutagenicity of the diol-epoxide but significantly decreased the mutagenic effect of the K-region epoxide. This inactivation was enhanced by the addition of glutathione transferases. Both epoxides were inactivated by glutathione in the presence of each of the four enzymes, but with varying efficiencies. Inactivation of the K-region epoxide (in terms of its mutagenicity in the presence of glutathione) required extremely little enzyme, about 1000 times less than for the diol-epoxide. On a molar basis, glutathione transferase X (followed by C greater than A greater than or equal to B) was clearly the most efficient enzyme in inactivating both substrates and also more efficient than were three other purified enzymes (microsomal epoxide hydrolase, cytosolic epoxide hydrolase, and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase) previously investigated in this test system. Taking into account the amounts of enzyme present in rat liver, the glutathione transferases C and X were most effective in inactivating the epoxides examined. Thus, the newly discovered glutathione transferase X appears to be of substantial significance in the inactivation of two structural prototypes of epoxides derived from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, a K-region epoxide and a non-bay-region vicinal diol-epoxide.",Is glutathione mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False

All compounds were negative in the repair test but induced base pair substitutions in S. typhimurium. The mutagenicity of NALED is due to the direct alkylating ability of the parental molecule and to mutagenic metabolites generated by enzymatic splitting of the side chain. Glutathion-dependent enzymes in the S9-mix eliminate the mutagenic activity of NALED completely.

228,"7 epoxide-containing compounds: allylbenzene oxide, styrene oxide, trans-beta-methylstyrene oxide, 4-chlorophenyl glycidyl ether, vinylcyclohexene dioxide, octene dioxide and hexene dioxide were evaluated for mutagenic activity in 4 histidine-requiring strains of Salmonella typhimurium, namely: TA1535, TA100, TA1537 and TA98. These epoxides, except trans-beta-methylstyrene oxide, were mutagenic in TA1535 and TA100 but none of the tested compounds caused mutations in strains TA1537 and TA98. Both the cytosolic (100000 g soluble) and/or microsomal (100000 g pellet) fractions derived from noninduced mouse, guinea pig, and/or rat consistently decreased the mutagenic activity of the 3 most active mutagens: allylbenzene oxide, styrene oxide and 4-chlorophenyl glycidyl ether. This reduction was found to depend on the substrate and the source of the enzyme fraction. Glutathione alone or in combination with the mouse cytosolic fraction resulted in negligible suppression in the mutagenic activity of the 3 epoxides under the conditions reported in this paper.

229,"Glutathione is activated to a mutagen by gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Other thiols, such as cysteine, penicillamine, cysteine ethylester, and cysteinylglycine, are direct mutagens in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity test. Thiol mutagenesis is oxidative in nature and involves H2O2 and possibly hydroxyl radicals. Transition metals are crucial for thiol autoxidation. The role of copper and ceruloplasmin (CP) in thiol-dependent mutagenesis was studied in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA102. Cu and CP at low concentrations enhanced thiol-dependent mutagenesis in the presence, but not in the absence, of added Fe. The degree of enhancement depended on the type of thiol. At high Cu or CP concentrations, thiol mutagenesis was inhibited. Cu also decreased the mutagenicity of H2O2. Cu- and CP-enhanced mutagenesis were inhibited by radical scavengers, catalase, and peroxidase but not by superoxide dismutase. The effects of Cu and CP on thiol-dependent mutagenesis were similar to their effects on thiol-driven lipid peroxidation. The results indicate that the role of Cu and CP in the enhancement of thiol mutagenesis is the facilitation of the transfer of electrons from a thiol to iron, rather than in catalysis of the Fenton reaction.",Is Glutathione mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True

Protection against mutagenicity of CHMA was mediated by glutathione and was partially dependent on glutathione S-transferase activity. 3. In contrast to the above findings, CHMA showed lower mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli strains of bacteria that are deficient in glutathione compared to their mutagenicity in parental (glutathione-rich) bacterial strains. 4.

231,"Four glutathione transferases (EC 2.5.1.18), glutathione transferases A, B, and C and a hitherto unknown form, termed X, were purified to apparent homogeneity from rat liver cytosol. They were investigated for their abilities to inactivate two mutagenic epoxides derived from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benz(a)anthracene, the K-region epoxide benz(a)anthracene 5,6-oxide and the diol-epoxide r-8,t-9-dihydroxy-t-10,11-oxy-8,9,10, 11-tetrahydrobenz(a)anthracene. Mutagenic activity was determined using Salmonella typhimurium his- strain TA100. Glutathione alone had little if any influence on the mutagenicity of the diol-epoxide but significantly decreased the mutagenic effect of the K-region epoxide. This inactivation was enhanced by the addition of glutathione transferases. Both epoxides were inactivated by glutathione in the presence of each of the four enzymes, but with varying efficiencies. Inactivation of the K-region epoxide (in terms of its mutagenicity in the presence of glutathione) required extremely little enzyme, about 1000 times less than for the diol-epoxide. On a molar basis, glutathione transferase X (followed by C greater than A greater than or equal to B) was clearly the most efficient enzyme in inactivating both substrates and also more efficient than were three other purified enzymes (microsomal epoxide hydrolase, cytosolic epoxide hydrolase, and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase) previously investigated in this test system. Taking into account the amounts of enzyme present in rat liver, the glutathione transferases C and X were most effective in inactivating the epoxides examined. Thus, the newly discovered glutathione transferase X appears to be of substantial significance in the inactivation of two structural prototypes of epoxides derived from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, a K-region epoxide and a non-bay-region vicinal diol-epoxide.",Is Glutathione mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False

Furthermore, their antitumor activity against adherent and suspended cells, namely, human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231), and human monocytes from histiocytic lymphoma (U-937), was investigated. The results demonstrated that GF reduced the viability and proliferation of NIH3T3 immortalized murine fibroblasts for concentrations >0.8 µg/mL and incubation times of 48 and 72 h. AGP showed no toxic effects in any of the tested concentrations and incubation times. The same results were obtained for MDA-MB-231 cells. The viability of the U-937 cells was not affected by either GF or AGP.

(CME) were studied using WP2, Ames (TA1535 and TA1537), and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test systems. The results of our studies showed that 5 µM concentration of aflatoxin B1(AFB1) changed the frequencies of SCE and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. When 5 and 10 µg/mL concentrations of CME was added to AFB1, the frequencies of SCE and MDA level were decreased and SOD, GSH, and GPx levels were increased. The extract CME did not show any mutagenicity on Ames (Salmonella typhimurium TA1535, TA1537) and WP2 (Escherichia coli) test systems.

In this study, we investigated the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic and cancer preventive activities of aqueous extract of a macrofungus Phellinus rimosus (Berk) Pilat. The extract exhibited superoxide anion (O2-), hydroxyl radical (*OH), nitric oxide (NO*) scavenging and lipid peroxidation inhibiting activities. The inhibitory concentrations required by the extract to scavenge 50% (IC50) of the superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical and nitric oxide generated were 126 +/- 5.1, 71 +/- 4.7 and 31 +/- 4.5 microg/ml respectively. The concentration required to inhibit 50% of Fe2+ induced lipid peroxidation in rat liver homogenate was 318 +/- 2.4 microg/ml. The extract showed significant (P<0.05) anti-inflammatory activity in a dose dependent manner. Extract (100 mg/kg body wt, p.o) inhibited 44.5, 45.4 and 47% carrageenen, dextran and formalin induced inflammations respectively. The antimutagenic activity was determined by the Ames' Salmonella mutagenecity assay using histidine mutant Salmonella typhimurium strains. The extract at concentration of 5 mg/plate showed antimutagenecity against benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and 4-nitro-o-pheneylenediamine (NPDA) induced mutations of TA98 and TA100 respectively. Anticarcinogenic activity was evaluated using N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in rats. Serum gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities and lipid peroxidation level (MDA) were elevated significantly (P<0.05) in the NDEA alone treated group of animals. Treatment of the extract (25 and 50 mg/kg body wt, p.o.) prior to the NDEA administration decreased the serum GGT, GOT, GPT and ALP activities and MDA level in a dose dependent manner. The NDEA alone treated animals showed altered serum albumin/globulin ratio (A:G ratio), hyperfibrinogenaemia, increased hepatic glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, glutathione-peroxidsae (GPx) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) level compared to the extract plus NDEA treated group. The extract also inhibited in vitro aniline hydroxylase (AH) activity of rat liver induced by phenobarbitone in a dose dependent manner.

238,"Chloral hydrate is widely used as a sedative and a hypnotic in pediatric medicine. It is also a byproduct of water chlorination. Chloral hydrate has been shown to be genotoxic in numerous prokaryotic and eukaryotic assay systems including human lymphocytes in vitro. One of its metabolites, trichloroacetic acid, has demonstrated hepatocarcinogenic activity in mice. Trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene, both of which are metabolized to chloral hydrate, have been shown to be carcinogenic in rats and/or mice. Because of this evidence of carcinogenicity and because of the wide-spread use of chloral hydrate, 16- or 17-day range-finding toxicity studies and separate 16- or 17-day metabolism studies were performed in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice in preparation for further long-term rodent studies. In addition, in vitro studies of the metabolism and DNA-binding capacity of chloral hydrate and its metabolites were performed. Genetic toxicity studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, Drosophila melanogaster, and mouse bone marrow cells. For the range-finding studies, groups of eight male and eight female F344/N Nctr BR rats and B6C3F1/Nctr BR (C57BL/6N x C3H/HeN MTV-) mice were administered 0, 50, 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg chloral hydrate per kg body weight in water by gavage 5 days per week for 17 days (rats) or 16 days (mice) for a total of 12 doses. One male rat receiving 800 mg/kg died after five doses. Two 800 mg/kg female rats died after dosing ended but before study termination. One male mouse in each group except the 400 mg/kg group died before the end of the study. Two 800 mg/kg female mice also died before the end of the study. The final mean body weight of 800 mg/kg male rats and the mean body weight gains of 400 and 800 mg/kg males were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls. The mean body weight gains of all groups of dosed male mice were significantly greater than that of the vehicle control group. The only clinical finding in rats and mice attributed to chloral hydrate treatment was light sedation in the 400 mg/kg groups and heavy sedation in the 800 mg/kg groups; sedation subsided within 30 minutes or 3 hours, respectively. The liver weights of 400 mg/kg male mice and 800 mg/kg male and female mice were significantly greater than those of the vehicle control groups. No chemical-related lesions were observed in rats or mice. Male and female rats and mice were administered a single dose of 50 or 200 mg chloral hydrate per kg body weight in water by gavage, or 12 doses of 50 or 200 mg/kg over 17 days (rats) or 16 days (mice). Plasma concentrations of chloral hydrate and its metabolites were determined 15 minutes, 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours, and 2, 4, 8, and 16 days after receiving 1 or 12 doses. Maximum concentrations of chloral hydrate were observed at the initial sampling point of 15 minutes. By 1 hour, the concentrations had dropped substantially, and by 3 hours, chloral hydrate could not be detected in rats or mice. Trichloroacetic acid was the major metabolite detected in the plasma. In rats, the concentrations rose slowly, with the peaks occurring between 1 and 6 hours after treatment. In mice, the peak concentrations were found 1 hour after dosing. The concentrations then slowly decreased such that by 2 days the metabolite could no longer be detected in rats or mice. Trichloroethanol was assayed both as the free alcohol and its glucuronide. In rats, the maximum concentrations of free trichloroethanol occurred at 15 minutes, while the peak concentrations of trichloroethanol glucuronide were found at 1 hour; by 3 hours, concentrations of both metabolites approached background levels. In mice, the maximum concentrations of both metabolites occurred at 15 minutes, and by 1 to 3 hours concentrations approached background levels. The plasma concentrations of chloral hydrate and its metabolites were dose dependent in rats and mice. In mice, plasma concentrations of trichloroacetic acid were significantly higher after a single dose than after 12 doses. None of the metabolic parameters appears to account for species differences that may exist in hepatocarcinogenicity. The data from the study of metabolism and DNA adduct formation indicated that in vitro metabolism of 200 microM to 5 mM chloral hydrate by male B6C3F1 mouse liver microsomes (control microsomes) generated free radical intermediates that resulted in endogenous lipid peroxidation, forming malondialdehyde, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propionaldehyde. Similar concentrations of trichloroacetic acid and trichloroethanol, the primary metabolites of chloral hydrate, also generated free radicals and induced lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation induced by trichloroacetic acid nearly equaled that induced by chloral hydrate, while that from trichloroethanol was three- to fourfold less. Metabolism of 200 microM to 5 mM chloral hydrate, trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroethanol by liver microsomes of B6C3F1 mice pretreated with pyrazole (pyrazole-induced microsomes) yielded lipid peroxidation products at concentrations two- to threefold greater than those from liver microsomes of untreated mice. Additionally, chloral hydrate-induced lipid peroxidation catalyzed by control and pyrazole-induced microsomes was reduced significantly by 2,4-dichloro-6-phenylphenoxyethylamine, a general cytochrome P450 inhibitor. Human lymphoblastoid transgenic cells expressing cytochrome P(450)2E1 metabolized 200 to 5,000 micrograms/mL chloral hydrate to reactants inducing mutations, whereas the parental cell line was inactive. The malondialdehyde-modified DNA adduct, 3-(2-deoxy-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)pyrimido[1,2 alpha]purin-10(3H)-one (MDA-MG-1), formed from the metabolism of 1 mM chloral hydrate, trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroethanol by control B6C3F1 mouse liver microsomes, mouse pyrazole-induced microsomes, male F344/N rat liver microsomes, and human liver microsomes in the presence and absence of calf thymus DNA was also determined. When incubated in the absence of calf thymus DNA, the amount of malondialdehyde formed from metabolism by pyrazole-induced mouse microsomes was twice that from rat or human liver microsomes. Amounts of chloral hydrate-induced and trichloroacetic acid-induced lipid peroxidation products formed from metabolism by rat and human liver microsomes were similar, and these quantities were about twice those formed from the metabolism of trichloroethanol. The quantity of MDA-MG-1 formed from the metabolism of chloral hydrate, trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroethanol by mouse, rat, and human liver microsomes exhibited a linear correlation with the quantity of malondialdehyde formed under incubation conditions in the absence of calf thymus DNA. Chloral hydrate was shown to be mutagenic in vitro and in vivo. At doses from 1,000 to 10,000 micrograms/plate, it induced mutations in S. typhimurium strain TA100, with and without S9 activation; an equivocal response was obtained in S. typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of S9, and no mutagenicity was detected with strain TA1535 or TA1537. Chloral hydrate at doses from 1,700 to 5,000 micrograms/mL induced sister chromatid exchanges; at doses from 1,000 to 3,000 micrograms/mL, chromosomal aberrations were induced in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with and without S9. Results of a sex-linked recessive lethal test in D. melanogaster were unclear; administration of chloral hydrate by feeding produced an inconclusive increase in recessive lethal mutations, results of the injection experiment were negative. An in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test with chloral hydrate at doses from 125 to 500 mg/kg gave a positive dose trend. In summary, due to the absence of chloral hydrate-induced histopathologic lesions in rats and mice, no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) were based on body weights of rats and liver weights of mice. The NOAELs for rats and mice were 200 mg/kg. Chloral hydrate was rapidly metabolized by rats and mice, with trichloroacetic acid occurring as the major metabolite. Peak concentrations of trichloroacetic acid occurred more quickly in mice. Plasma concentrations of chloral hydrate were dose dependent, but metabolic rates were unaffected by dose or sex. Chloral hydrate was mutagenic in vitro and in vivo. Metabolism of chloral hydrate and its metabolites produced free radicals that resulted in lipid peroxidation in liver microsomes of mice, rats, and humans. Induction of cytochrome P(450)2E1 by pyrazole increased the concentrations of lipid peroxidation products; inhibition of cytochrome P(450)2E1 by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine reduced these concentrations. Metabolism of chloral hydrate and its metabolites by mouse, rat, and human liver microsomes formed malondialdehyde, and in the presence of calf thymus DNA formed the DNA adduct MDA-MG-1.",Is Chloral hydrate mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True

241,"Cigarette filters pose a serious litter and toxic waste disposal problem, because of their not biodegradability and to the leaching of toxins in the environment. Therefore, cigarette butts need to be manipulated as special waste, with potential risks to human health and environment. In the present study, the genotoxic potential of a methanol extract from commonly discharged cigarette butts (CBE) was evaluated in the bacterial reverse mutation assay on Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 and Escherichia coli WP2uvrA strains, both in the absence and presence of the S9 exogenous metabolic activator. Furthermore, the ability of the natural sesquiterpenes β-caryophyllene (CRY) and β-caryophyllene oxide (CRYO) to inhibit the mutagenicity of CBE was studied as a possible preventive strategy. In order to identify the potential antimutagenic mechanisms, three different protocols (pretreatment, cotreatment, and posttreatment) were applied. CBE showed to increase the number of revertant colonies in all the strains tested in presence of S9, so resulting mutagenic. In the antimutagenicity assay, both CRY and CRYO significantly reduced the revertant colonies induced by CBE, although with different potency and specificity. For both sesquiterpenes, the antimutagenicity was strong in all experimental conditions, except for the cotreatment of CRY with CBE in WP2uvrA, which produced a moderate inhibition. Both desmutagenic and bioantimutagenic mechanisms seem to be involved in the antimutagenicity of the test substances. Taking into account the potential genotoxicity of cigarette butts, CRY and CRYO appear as possible further candidates as environmental decontaminants against this hazardous waste. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Although most bacterial assays for genotoxicity were negative in the absence of metabolic activation, consistently positive results were found with metabolic activation in Salmonella strains TA1537, TA1538, and TA98, which were interpreted as indicative of point mutations. Studies using L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells appeared to confirm this mutagenic activity. Mammalian assays for chromosome damage, however, were negative and animal tests found no evidence of dominant lethal mutations. Cases reports describe patients patch tested with Disperse Blue 7 to determine the source of apparent adverse reactions to textiles.

Seven of the PAH otrtho-quinones were potent cytotoxins yielding IC50 values for cell survival in the range 1-30 microns. PAH ortho-quinones were grouped into three classes based on their cytotoxicity profiles: group I contained ortho-quinones (e.g., naphthalene-1,2-dione and 7,12-dimethylbenz[alpha]anthracene-3,4-dione) which reduced cell viability and cell survival; group II contained ortho-quinones (e.g., benz[alpha]anthracene-3,4-dione and 5-methylchrysene-1,2-dione which reduced cell survival but had no effect on cell viability; and group III contained ortho-quinones (e.g., benzo[alpha]pyrene-7,8-dione) which had a pronounced effect on cell viability but minimal effects on cell survival. Using hepatoma cell suspensions and rat liver subcellular fractions, it was found that ortho-quinones underwent preferential enzymatic one-electron redox-cycling and produced superoxide anion radical (O2-.) and/or ortho-semiquinone anion or alternant radicals. ortho-Quinones that reduced cell viability produced O2-. and caused the most total free radical formation, while those that reduced cell survival produced ortho-semiquinone anion or alternant radicals only. PAH ortho-quinones were also tested as direct-acting mutagens in Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102 and TA104. They were found to be more mutagenic than the test mutagens used for each tester strain, and were predominantly frameshift mutagens. The presence of an activating system (Aroclor-induced rat liver S9 plus NADPH) did not increase the mutagenicity of ortho-quinones in tester strains that are sensitive to oxidative mutagens (TA102 and TA104). These data suggest that PAH ortho-quinones produced by DD are cytotoxic and mutagenic by different mechanisms. The mechanism of cytotoxicity involves the formation of reactive oxygen species and/or ortho-semiquinone anion or alternant radicals. The mechanism of mutagenicity is independent of free radical formation and is related to the ability of PAH orthooffinones to intercalate and covalently modify DNA.","Is naphthalene-1,2-dione mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?",True
247,"Ethylbenzene is mainly used in the manufacture of styrene. Ethylbenzene is also a major component of mixed xylenes used as solvents in agricultural and home insecticide sprays, rubber and chemical manufacturing, and household degreasers, paints, adhesives, and rust preventives. Ethylbenzene is also used as an antiknock agent in aviation and motor fuels. Ethylbenzene was nominated for study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) because of its potential for widespread human exposure and because of its structural similarity to benzene and toluene. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to ethylbenzene (greater than 99% pure) by inhalation for 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, mouse lymphoma cells, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. In previously reported 13-week toxicity studies in which F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to ethylbenzene by whole body inhalation exposure, no histopathologic changes were observed (NTP, 1992). 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats were exposed to 0, 75, 250, or 750 ppm ethylbenzene by inhalation, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 104 weeks. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings Survival of male rats in the 750 ppm group was significantly less than that of the chamber controls. Mean body weights of 250 and 750 ppm males were generally less than those of the chamber controls beginning at week 20. Mean body weights of exposed groups of females were generally less than those of chamber controls during the second year of the study. Pathology Findings In male rats exposed to 750 ppm, the incidences of renal tubule adenoma and adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly greater than the chamber control incidences. In addition, the incidence of renal tubule hyperplasia in 750 ppm males was significantly greater than that in the chamber controls. The findings from an extended evaluation (step section) of the kidneys showed a significant increase in the incidences of renal tubule adenoma and hyperplasia in 750 ppm males and females; the incidence of renal tubule adenoma or carcinoma (combined) was significantly increased in 750 ppm males. The severities of nephropathy in 750 ppm male and all exposed female rats were significantly increased relative to the chamber controls. The incidence of interstitial cell adenoma in the testis of 750 ppm males was significantly greater than that in the chamber control group and slightly exceeded the historical control range for inhalation studies. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 75, 250, or 750 ppm ethylbenzene by inhalation, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 103 weeks. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings Survival of exposed groups of male and female mice was similar to that of the chamber controls. Mean body weights of female mice exposed to 75 ppm were greater than those of the chamber controls from week 72 until the end of the study. Pathology Findings In 750 ppm males, the incidences of alveolar/ bronchiolar adenoma and alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly greater than those in the chamber control group but were within the NTP historical control ranges. The incidence of alveolar epithelial metaplasia in 750 ppm males was significantly greater than that in the chamber controls. In 750 ppm females, the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly greater than those in the chamber control group but were within the historical control ranges. The incidence of eosinophilic foci in 750 ppm females was significantly increased compared to that in the chamber controls. There was a spectrum of nonneoplastic liver changes related to ethylbenzene exposure in male mice, including syncytial alteration of hepatocytes, hepatocellular hypertrophy, and hepatocyte necrosis. rosis. The incidences of hyperplasia of the pituitary gland pars distalis in 250 and 750 ppm females and the incidences of thyroid gland follicular cell hyperplasia in 750 ppm males and females were significantly increased compared to those in the chamber control groups. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Ethylbenzene gave little indication of mutagenicity, in vitro or in vivo. No induction of mutations was noted in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA97, TA98, TA100, or TA1535 with or without S9 metabolic activation, and no increases in sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations were observed in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells treated with ethylbenzene, with or without S9. In the mouse lymphoma assay, a significant mutagenic response was noted in the absence of S9, but only at the highest nonlethal dose tested and with accompanying cytotoxicity; the test was not performed with S9. No increases in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes were observed in vivo in peripheral blood samples from male and female mice exposed to ethylbenzene for 13 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year inhalation studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of ethylbenzene in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of renal tubule neoplasms. The incidences of testicular adenoma were also increased. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of ethylbenzene in female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of renal tubule adenomas. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of ethylbenzene in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of ethylbenzene in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms. Exposure of male and female rats to ethylbenzene resulted in increased incidences of renal tubule hyperplasia and increased severities of nephropathy. Exposure of male mice to ethylbenzene resulted in increased incidences of alveolar epithelial metaplasia, syncytial alteration of hepatocytes, hepatocellular hypertrophy, hepatocyte necrosis, and thyroid gland follicular cell hyperplasia. In female mice, ethylbenzene exposure resulted in increased incidences of eosinophilic foci of the liver, pituitary gland pars distalis hyperplasia, and thyroid gland follicular cell hyperplasia.

248,"The charred surface of fish and beef showed strong mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium test strains when activated by S-9 mix of rat liver. The pyrolysis products of proteins and amino acids were also highly mutagenic. Among the pyrolysis products of amino acids, those of tryptophan, serine, and glutamic acid were most active. The new gamma-carboline derivatives, 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole, were purified from the pyrolysis products of tryptophan. These new compounds were stronger mutagens than aflatoxin B1 towards S. typhimurium TA98, a frameshift type mutant, and they also transformed cryopreserved Syrian hamster embryo cells in vitro. Tryptophan pyrolysate also contained the beta-carboline derivatives, norharman and harman, which are not mutagenic alone, but act as comutagens. A mixture of norharman or harman and nonmutagenic aniline or o-toluidine was strongly mutagenic. The mutagenicities of charred products of other foods, such as seaweed and garlic, are reviewed in this article. Flavonoids, such as kaempferol and quercetin, and glycosides of these flavonoles were mutagenic. The mutagenicity of cooked vegetables depends partly on these flavonoid derivatives. The already-known existence of benzol[a]pyrene and nitroso compounds in cooked food is also reviewed.","Is 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole mutagenic for TA98 strain?",True
249,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ is a potential pharmacological target for disease-modification in Parkinson's disease (PD), mainly acting by modulating the neuroinflammatory response. However, currently available agonists thiazolidinediones (TZDs) present limitations due to safety concerns. We evaluated a novel thiobarbituric-like compound MDG548, which acts as a functional PPARγ agonist displaying higher and selective binding affinity as compared to TZDs. Neuroprotection by MDG548 was tested in vitro and in a mouse MPTP model of PD, and neuroinflammation was investigated as a putative underlying mechanism. Viability assay on rat cortical neurons showed lack of cytotoxic effect in the dose-range of 100 nM-10 μM, which was therefore used for testing in vitro protection against H2O2 and MPP+ neurotoxicity. MDG548 dose-dependently increased cell viability of rat cortical neurons co-treated with H2O2 or pre-exposed to MDG548 prior to H2O2. Moreover, MDG548 induced neuroprotection in MPP+-treated PC12 cells. NF-kB activation was investigated to assess anti-inflammatory activity. MDG548 dose-dependently decreased NF-kB activation induced by LPS (100 ng/100ml) in HEK-Blue-hTLR4 cells. Given the supposed cancer risk of other PPARγ agonists, Ames test for genotoxicity was performed in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98 strains, showing that MDG548 was not genotoxic. In vivo, BL/6J mice were treated with MPTP (20mg/kg i.p. once/day for 4 days) in association with saline or MDG548 (2, 5, 10 mg/kg i.p.). Stereological counting showed that MDG548 prevented the MPTP-induced reduction in TH-positive cells in the substantia nigra compacta (SNc) at all doses tested. Moreover, MDG548 reduced reactive microglia and iNOS induction in the SNc. MDG548, being a non-TZD compound with high PPARγ affinity, void of genotoxicity, and with in vitro as well as in vivo neuroprotective properties, provides a promising alternative in the search for safer PPARγ agonists to be tested as potential disease-modifying drugs in PD.",Is MDG548 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
250,"Sodium xylenesulfonate is used as a hydrotrope, an organic compound that increases the ability of water to dissolve other molecules. Sodium xylenesulfonate is a component in a variety of widely used shampoos and liquid household detergents where it can constitute up to 10% of the total solution. Because of its widespread use, the potential for human exposure to sodium xylenesulfonate is great. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were administered sodium xylenesulfonate in water or 50% ethanol dermally for 17 days, 14 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. 17-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Groups of five male and five female rats were administered 300 mL of 0, 5, 15, 44, 133, or 400 mg/mL sodium xylenesulfonate in distilled water by dermal application 5 days per week for 17 days. All rats survived to the end of the study. Final mean body weights and body weight gains of dosed rats were similar to those of the control groups. Dermal applications of 300 mL of 5, 15, 44, 133, and 400 mg/mL delivered average daily doses of approximately 10, 30, 90, 260, and 800 mg sodium xylenesulfonate/kg body weight to males and 13, 40, 120, 330, and 1,030 mg/kg to females. Clinical findings generally involved the skin of dosed animals and included tan or brown skin discoloration and crusty white deposits (presumed to be dried chemical) at the site of application. Neither of these observations were considered significant findings. The relative liver weights of 133 and 400 mg/mL male and female rats were significantly greater than those of the control groups, but the absolute liver weights were not increased and the biological significance of the relative differences in liver weight was unclear. In males and females, the few lesions observed grossly and microscopically were generally attributed to repeated clipping and were not considered related to chemical administration. 17-DAY STUDY IN MICE: Groups of five male and five female mice were administered 100 mL of 0, 5, 15, 44, 133, or 400 mg/mL sodium xylenesulfonate in distilled water by dermal application 5 days per week for 17 days. All mice survived to the end of the study. Final mean body weights and body weight gains of dosed mice were similar to those of the controls. Dermal applications of 5, 15, 44, 133, and 400 mg/mL delivered average daily doses of approximately, 20, 60, 190, 540, and 1,600 mg sodium xylenesulfonate/kg body weight to males and 26, 80, 220, 680, and 2,000 mg/kg to females. Clinical findings included crusty white deposits (presumed to be dried chemical) at the site of application in two 133 mg/mL males and in all 400 mg/mL males and females. The absolute and relative liver weights of 15 and 44 mg/mL males and 400 mg/mL males and females were significantly greater than those of the control groups, but the biological significance of these differences was unclear. The few skin lesions observed grossly and microscopically in males and females were generally attributed to repeated clipping and were not considered related to chemical administration. 14-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were administered 300 mL of 0, 5, 15, 44, 133, or 400 mg/mL sodium xylenesulfonate in 50% ethanol by dermal application for 14 weeks. For special hematology and clinical pathology studies, additional groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were administered 0, 5, 15, 44, 133, or 400 mg/mL sodium xylenesulfonate in 50% ethanol by dermal application for 14 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study. Final mean body weights and body weight gains of dosed male and female rats were similar to those of the control groups. Dermal applications of 5, 15, 44, 133, and 400 mg/mL delivered average daily doses of approximately 6, 20, 60, 170, and 500 mg sodium xylenesulfonate/kg body weight to males and 10, 30, 90, 260, and 800 mg/kg to females. The only notable clinical finding was brown discoloration of the skin at the site of application in dosed animals. Hemaation in dosed animals. Hematology and clinical chemistry parameters of dosed groups of males and females were significantly different from those of the controls in several instances, but these differences were sporadic and did not demonstrate a treatment relationship. The absolute and relative liver weights of males receiving 44, 133, or 400 mg/mL were significantly less than those of the control group, but the biological significance of these differences was unclear, and there were no treatment-related histopathologic effects in the liver. There were no significant differences in liver weights in female rats. Minimal hyperplasia of the epidermis at the site of application occurred in both male and female rats in the control group as well as most dosed groups. The incidence of epidermal hyperplasia in 400 mg/mL males was possibly chemical related. 14-Week Study in Mice: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were administered 100 mL of 0, 5, 15, 44, 133, or 400 mg/mL sodium xylenesulfonate in 50&percnt; ethanol by dermal application for 14 weeks. There were no chemical-related deaths. The mean body weight gain of the 400 mg/mL males was significantly greater than that of the control group. Dermal applications of 5, 15, 44, 133, and 400 mg/mL delivered average daily doses of approximately 17, 40, 140, 440, and 1,300 mg sodium xylenesulfonate/kg body weight to males and 20, 60, 170, 530, and 1,630 mg/kg to females. There were no clinical findings related to sodium xylenesulfonate administration. Epidermal hyperplasia occurred in one 44 mg/mL female, two 133 mg/mL males, five 400 mg/mL males, and four 400 mg/kg females. Hyperplasia of the epidermis in 400 mg/mL males and females was probably related to chemical administration. Chronic inflammation of the skin occurred primarily in the control groups of males and females. These lesions consisted of mononuclear inflammatory cells in the dermis. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were dermally administered 0, 60, 120, or 240 mg sodium xylenesulfonate/kg body weight in 50&percnt; ethanol for 104 weeks. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings: Survival of dosed males and females was similar to that of the control groups. Mean body weights of dosed males and females were similar to those of the controls throughout the study. In male groups, there were no clinical findings considered treatment related. In females, clinical findings were limited to irritation at the site of application in one control female, four 120 mg/kg females, and two 240 mg/kg females. Pathology Findings: There were no neoplasms at any site (including the skin) that were considered treatment related.Low incidences of hyperplasia of the epidermis at the site of application occurred in males in the 60, 120, and 240 mg/kg groups. Low incidences of hyperplasia of the epidermis at the site of application also occurred in females in the 120 and 240 mg/kg groups, and they occurred with a significant positive trend. Low incidences of hyperplasia of the sebaceous gland occurred in control and 60 mg/kg males and in control, 120 mg/kg, and 240 mg/kg females. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were dermally administered 0, 182, 364, or 727 mg sodium xylenesulfonate/kg body weight in 50&percnt; ethanol for 104 to 105 weeks. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings: Survival of dosed males and females was similar to that of the control groups. Mean body weights of dosed males and females were generally similar to those of the controls throughout the study; however, the mean body weights of 727 mg/kg females were greater than those of the control group from week 85 to week 97. With the exception of irritation at the site of application in one 364 mg/kg female, there were no clinical findings related to sodium xylenesulfonate administration. Pathology Findings: There were no neoplasms at any site (including the skin) that were considered treatment related.Hyperplasia of the epidermis occurred in control,364 mg/kg, and 727 mg/kg males and in control and dosed females. In male mice, the incidences occurred with a significant positive trend. Focal ulceration occurred in one 727 mg/kg male and in one female in each dose group. In males and females from control and dosed groups, the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepato- cellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were generally higher than those expected by spontaneous occurrence. The incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms in some groups of males and females exceeded the NTP historical control range. Male mice had a pattern of nonneoplastic liver lesions along with silver stained positive helical organisms within the liver which suggests an infection with Helicobacter hepaticus. The findings in this study of sodium xylenesulfonate were not considered to have been significantly impacted by the infection with H. hepaticus or its associated hepatitis. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Sodium xylenesulfonate was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 with or without induced liver S9. Equivocal results were obtained in a mutation assay with mouse lymphoma cells in the presence of induced S9; no evidence of mutagenicity was noted without S9 in this assay. In cytogenetic tests with sodium xylenesulfonate in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, significant increases in sister chromatid exchanges were observed in the absence of S9 only, and no increases in chromosomal aberrations were observed with or without S9. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year dermal studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of sodium xylenesulfonate in male or female F344/N rats administered 60, 120, or 240 mg/kg or in male or female B6C3F1 mice administered 182, 364, or 727 mg/kg. Increased incidences of epidermal hyperplasia in female rats and male mice may have been related to exposure to sodium xylenesulfonate.

251,"Chlorogenic acid, a compound which occurs naturally in many food items, was assayed for genotoxic activity in 3 different test systems: reverse mutations in the preincubation test with Salmonella typhimurium, gene conversion with Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain D7, and chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Chlorogenic acid was directly convertogenic and clastogenic, but lacked a mutagenic capacity in the Salmonella bioassay. The transition metal Mn2+ enhanced the clastogenic and convertogenic activity of chlorogenic acid. In the presence of Mn2+ (10(-4)M), chlorogenic acid increased the frequency of his+ revertants in TA98 and TA100 strains of S. typhimurium. Caffeic acid and, to a lesser degree, quinic acid, which are components of chlorogenic acid, also showed genotoxic activity. The results show the importance of using several assays in combination with transition metals when testing for genotoxicity.",Is Chlorogenic acid mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
252,"A murine renal microsomal enzyme responsible for the mutagenic activation of 3-methoxy-4-aminoazobenzene (3-MeO-AAB) was characterized by its catalytic activity for the mutagenic and metabolic conversion of 3-MeO-AAB. Incubation of 3-MeO-AAB with a renal or hepatic microsome fraction from male BALB/c mice in the presence of NADPH and NADH yielded N-hydroxy and 4'-hydroxy metabolites of 3-MeO-AAB as determined by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography, and the enzyme responsible for the N-hydroxylation was named 3-MeO-AAB N-hydroxylase. A mutagenicity test using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 bacteria as a tester strain has revealed that N-hydroxy-3-MeO-AAB is a potent direct mutagen but that 4'-hydroxy-3-MeO-AAB is not mutagenic. Although 3-MeO-AAB N-hydroxylase activity in liver microsomes showed no sex difference, the enzyme activity in the kidney was detected from male mice but not from females. However, administration of testosterone to female mice induced the enzyme in the kidney. Castration of male mice depressed the activity of 3-MeO-AAB N-hydroxylase in renal microsomes but it little affected the hepatic activity, and on administration of testosterone to the castrated mice the depressed renal microsomal activity recovered to a normal level. The activity of 3-MeO-AAB hydroxylase and the amount of cytochrome P-450 in renal microsomes showed a close correlation. Both renal and hepatic microsomes required NADPH as a main cofactor to mutagenize 3-MeO-AAB and to yield N-hydroxy-3-MeO-AAB from 3-MeO-AAB, and the enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by 7,8-benzoflavone. When the activities of renal and hepatic 3-MeO-AAB N-hydroxylase were compared on the basis of the amount of cytochrome P-450, the renal type enzyme showed about 8 times greater activity than hepatic type enzyme. These results indicate that the kidney contains an androgen-dependent microsomal 3-MeO-AAB hydroxylase which is different from an isozyme present in the liver and which is a new type of cytochrome P-450 isozyme.",Is N-hydroxy-3-MeO-AAB mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

None of the compounds was mutagenic without norharman. In the presence of norharman, however, nitrobenzene, nitrotoluene, nitroanisole, nitrochlorobenzene and nitrobenzaldehyde exhibited mutagenicity only to S. typhimurium TA98 with S9 mix.

In the present study, NMR spectroscopy showed the presence of cinnamaldehyde to be the major component of the bark. The possible mutagenic effects of cinnamon bark ethanolic extract (CEE, 0.01-1 mg/plate) cinnamon oil (CNO, 0.125-1 mg/plate), and its active component cinnamadehyde (CLD, 0.125-1 mg/plate) were evaluated. Antimutagenic activity of CEE, CNO, and CLD was also tested against various food borne mutagens (heterocyclic amines and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)) and sodium azide (SA) using Ames assay. Similarly, the antimicrobial activity was studied using agar well diffusion assay against various pathogens. CEE was non-mutagenic in any of the five tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102, and TA104) in Ames test. CEE exhibited antimutagenic activity against all the mutagens tested in the higher doses. Additionally, CEE, CNO, and CLD were effective against various pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, S. typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli in the agar well diffusion assay. Promising antimutagenic and antimicrobial properties were shown by the cinnamon bark ethanolic extract and cinnamaldehyde, respectively. Therefore, their role in cancer chemoprevention, as well as a natural antimicrobial agent must be exploited and studied in depth in in vivo conditions.",Is SA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
255,"Nitromezuril (NZL) is a novel triazine compound that exhibits remarkable anticoccidial activity. However, mutagenicity and genotoxicity of NZL have not been evaluated to date. This study evaluated the potential risks of NZL by testing for bacterial reverse mutation (Ames), mouse sperm abnormality (SA), bone marrow micronucleus (MN) and chromosomal aberration (CA). Mice were orally administered with NZL at 385, 192 and 96 mg/kg, corresponding to 0.5 ×, 0.25 × and 0.125 × the LD50 of NZL, respectively. No significant increases in SA and CA were found in mice treated with NZL for 5d and 3d, respectively (P>0.05). NZL at 96-385 mg/kg did not have significant influence on micronucleated polychromatic erythrocyte counts (P>0.05). These results suggest that NZL is not genotoxic. However, Ames test results were positive both with and without the S9 system for Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100, suggesting that NZL may be mutagenic. The mutagenic effects of NZL were different in in vitro and in vivo assays. Further studies should be conducted to confirm the safety of using and developing NZL as a novel anticoccidial drug.",Is Nitromezuril mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
256,"The antioxidant potency of Acacia salicina extracts was investigated. Total antioxidant capacity was determined using an ABTS(+) assay. Superoxide radical scavenging was measured using riboflavin-light-nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) assay. In addition, the content of phenols, total flavonoids and sterols were measured in the tested extracts. The petroleum ether exhibited a potent scavenging activity toward ABTS radical cations. Whereas, chloroform extract showed the highest activity against superoxides radicals and was also able to protect pKS plasmid DNA against hydroxyl radicals induced DNA damages. The antimutagenicity of these extracts was assayed using the Ames assay against Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and S. typhimurium TA 1535 tester strains at different concentrations. These extracts decreased significantly the mutagenecity induced by sodium azide (SA) and 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NOP).

257,"The mutagenic potential of total aqueous, total oligomers flavonoids (TOF), ethyl acetate (EA), chloroform (Chl), petroleum ether (PE) and methanol (MeOH) extracts from aerial parts of Moricandia arvensis was assessed using Ames Salmonella tester strains TA100 and TA1535 with and without metabolic activation (S9), and using plasmid pBluescript DNA assay. None of the different extracts produced a mutagenic effect, except aqueous extract when incubated with Salmonella typhimurium TA100 after metabolic activation. Likewise, the antimutagenicity of the same extracts was tested using the ""Ames test"". Our results showed that M. arvensis extracts possess antimutagenic effects against sodium azide (SA) in the two tested Salmonella assay systems, except metabolized aqueous and PE extracts when tested with S. typhimurium TA100 assay system. Different extracts were also found to be effective in protecting plasmid DNA against the strand breakage induced by hydroxyl radicals, except PE and aqueous extracts. Antioxidant capacity of the tested extracts was evaluated using the enzymatic (xanthine/xanthine oxidase assay) (X/XOD) and the non enzymatic (NBT/Riboflavine assay) systems. TOF extract was the more effective one in inhibiting both xanthine oxidase activity and NBT reduction.",Is ethyl acetate mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
258,"The mutagenic and antimutagenic effects of linalool, linalyl acetate and beta-caryophyllene were evaluated by the bacterial reverse mutation assay on Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100, and on Escherichia coli WP2uvrA strains. Neither linalool nor beta-caryophyllene showed mutagenicity, but linalyl acetate induced a statistically significant increase in the number of revertant colonies in WP2uvrA, both with and without S9 mixture. Linalool was devoid of antimutagenic activity against 2-nitrofluorene (2NF), sodium azide (SA), methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) and 2-aminoanthracene (2AA). In contrast, beta-caryophyllene showed a strong antimutagenic activity against 2NF: at the maximum concentration tested (6.40mg/plate) the number of 2NF-induced revertant colonies was reduced by 83.9%. beta-Caryophyllene also showed to counteract the mutagenicity of SA (in TA 100), MMS and 2AA (in WP2uvrA): the effect was weak against SA (inhibition lower than 25%) and moderate against MMS and 2AA (up to 30.5%). The antimutagenic activity of beta-caryophyllene observed here suggests further studies to evaluate its possible chemopreventive properties.",Is linalool mutagenic for WP2uvrA strain?,False
259,"Mutagenic and antimutagenic activities against direct acting mutagens, nifuroxazide (NF) and sodium azide (SA), and indirect acting mutagen aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) of extracts prepared from aerial parts of Pituranthos tortuosus were investigated in bacterial assay systems (i.e., the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA100, TA98, TA1538, TA1535, and the SOS chromotest with Escherichia coli PQ 37). It was found that all extracts obtained from P. tortuosus decreased the mutagenicity induced by AFB1 (10 microg/assay), SA (1.5 microg/assay), and NF (20 microg/assay). Ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol, and total oligomer flavenoid extracts exhibited the highest inhibition level of mutagenicity induced by the indirect mutagen AFB1. In addition, antiproliferative and apoptotic properties of these extracts have also been reported using two leukemia cell lines, L1210 and K562. The results revealed that all extracts showed a significant cytotoxic effect on these cell lines, and the effect was greater in the presence of human K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, whereas they do not induce apoptosis.",Is SA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
260,"beta-Ionone (BIO) is a degraded (C(13)) sesquiterpenoid compound found in a variety of edible and aromatic plants. BIO and other ionone derivatives have been used in fragrance products and as flavoring food additives. In this study we investigated the mutagenic and antimutagenic activities of BIO using the Salmonella/microsome assay. Mutagenicity was evaluated by two tests with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA98, TA97a and TA1535, without and with addition of S9 mixture. A first assay was performed by the plate incorporation procedure and a confirmation test by the pre-incubation method. In either test, no increase in the number of his(+) revertant colonies over the negative (solvent) control values was noted with any of the four tester strains thereby indicating that BIO was not genotoxic in the Salmonella assay. Antimutagenic activity was investigated by testing (by the plate incorporation method) different non-toxic doses of BIO against one or more non-toxic doses of direct-acting (sodium azide: SA, 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide: 4-NQNO, 2-nitrofluorene: 2-NF and nitro-o-phenylenediamine: NPD) as well as indirect-acting (cyclophosphamide: CP, benzo[a]pyrene: B[a]P, aflatoxin B1: AFB1, 2-aminoanthracene: 2-AA, and 2-aminofluorene: 2-AF) mutagens. BIO did not alter the effects of any direct-acting mutagen or B[a]P and 2-AF. Mutagenic effects of AFB1 and CP, however, were markedly and dose-dependently antagonized by BIO. It has been reported that, in the rat liver, activation of B[a]P and 2-AF depend on CYP1A1 activity, and that CYP2B subfamily is involved in the metabolic activation of CP and AFB1. It has also been described that BIO is a potent inhibitor of CYP2B1/2 and a weaker inhibitor of CYP1A1. Therefore, antagonism of CP-and AFB1-induced mutagenic effects by BIO could have been mediated-at least in part-by the inhibition of CYP2B enzymes.",Is beta-Ionone mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
261,"2-Amino-4,6-dinitrobenzoic acid (2-A-4,6-DNBA), 4-amino-2,6-dinitrobenzoic acid (4-A-2,6-DNBA), 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid (2,4,6-TNBA), 2-amino-4, 6-dinitrobenzylalcohol (2-A-4,6-DNBAlc), 4-amino-2,6-dinitrobenzylalcohol (4-A-2,6-DNBAlc), 2,4-dinitrotoluol-5-sulfonic acid (2,4-DNT-5-SA), 2,4-dinitrotoluol-3-sulfonic acid (2,4-DNT-3-SA), and 2, 4-dinitrobenzoic acid (2,4-DNBA) are derivatives of nitro-explosives that have been detected in groundwater close to munitions facilities. In the present study, the genotoxicity of these compounds was evaluated in Salmonella/microsome assays (in strains TA100 and TA98, with and without S9 and in TA98NR without S9), in chromosomal aberration (CA) tests with Chinese hamster fibroblasts (V79), and in micronucleus (MN) assays with human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. All compounds except the sulfonic acids were positive in the bacterial mutagenicity tests, with 2,4,6-TNBA producing the strongest response (8023 revertants/micromol in TA98 without S9 activation). 2-A-4,6-DNBA was a direct acting mutagen in TA98, but negative in TA100. The other positive compounds were approximately 1-3 orders of magnitude less mutagenic than 2,4,6-TNBA in TA98 and in TA100; relatively strong effects ( approximately 50-400 revertants/micromol) were produced by the benzylacohols in the two indicator strains. With the exception of 2,4-DNBA, the mutagenic responses were lower in the nitroreductase-deficient strain TA98NR than in the parental strain. 2,4-DNBA produced a marginally positive response in the V79-cell CA assay; the other substances were devoid of activity. Only the benzoic acids were tested for MN induction in HepG2 cells, and all produced positive responses. As in the bacterial assays, the strongest effect was seen with 2,4,6-TNBA (significant induction at >or=1.9 microM). 4-A-2,6-DNBA was positive at 432 microM; the weakest effect was observed with 2,4,-DNBA (positive at >or=920 microM). The differences in the sensitivity of the indicator cells to these agents can be explained by differences in the activities of enzymes involved in the activation of the compounds. The strong responses produced by some of the compounds in the human-derived cells suggest that environmental exposure to these breakdown products of nitro-explosives may pose a cancer risk in man.","Is 4-amino-2,6-dinitrobenzoic acid mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?",True
262,"alpha-Bisabolol (BISA) is a sesquiterpene alcohol found in the oils of chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) and other plants. BISA has been widely used in dermatological and cosmetic formulations. This study was undertaken to investigate the mutagenicity and antimutagenicity of BISA in the Salmonella/microsome assay. Mutagenicity of BISA was evaluated with TA100, TA98, TA97a and TA1535 Salmonella typhimurium strains, without and with addition of S9 mixture. No increase in the number of his+ revertant colonies over the negative (solvent) control values was observed with any of the four tester strains. In the antimutagenicity assays, BISA was tested up to the highest nontoxic dose (i.e. 50 and 150 microg/plate, with and without S9 mix, respectively) against direct-acting (sodium azide, SA; 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, 4-NQNO; 2-nitrofluorene, 2-NF; and nitro-o-phenylenediamine, NPD) as well as indirect-acting (cyclophosphamide, CP; benzo[a]pyrene, B[a]P; aflatoxin B1, AFB1; 2-aminoanthracene, 2-AA; and 2-aminofluorene, 2-AF) mutagens. BISA did not alter mutagenic activity of SA and of NPD, and showed only a weak inhibitory effect on the mutagenicity induced by 4-NQNO and 2-NF. The mutagenic effects of AFB1, CP, B[a]P, 2-AA and 2-AF, on the other hand, were all markedly and dose-dependently reduced by BISA. It was also found that BISA inhibited pentoxyresorufin-o-depentylase (PROD, IC50 2.76 microM) and ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD, 33.67 microM), which are markers for cytochromes CYP2B1 and 1A1 in rat liver microsomes. Since CYP2B1 converts AFB1 and CP into mutagenic metabolites, and CYP1A1 activates B[a]P, 2-AA and 2-AF, results suggest that BISA-induced antimutagenicity could be mediated by an inhibitory effect on the metabolic activation of these promutagens.",Is alpha-Bisabolol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
263,"The mutagenic activity of two newly synthesized oxadiazoles: 1,3-bis(5-benzylthio-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl) benzene (M1) and 1,4-bis(5-benzylthio-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl) benzene (M2) was studied in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA100, TA102 and TA1537 in the presence and absence of S9mix. The antimutagenicity of M1 and M2 against H2O2, sodium azide (SA) and 4-nitro-o-phenylene diamine (NPD) using the tester strains TA102, TA100 and TA97, respectively, was also investigated. The two compounds were found to be nonmutagenic using the four tester strains. However, they showed high mutagenic repression activity against hydrogen peroxide (95% and 97% for M1 and M2, respectively, at a concentration of 335 micrograms/plate). Moderate mutagenic repression against NPD (58% and 55% for M1 and M2, respectively, at a concentration of 167.5 micrograms/plate) and low mutagenic repression against SA (21% and 33% for M1 and M2 respectively, at a concentration of 335 micrograms/plate) was detected. The obtained results are very encouraging to test the above mentioned compounds as anticarcinogens.","Is 1,3-bis(5-benzylthio-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl) benzene mutagenic for TA100 or TA102 or TA1537 strain?",False
264,"Antimutagens from gaiyou (Artemisia argyi Levl. et Vant., Compositae) were examined. The methanol extract prepared from aerial parts of this plant strongly reduced the mutagenicity of 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), when Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was used in the presence of the rat liver microsomal fraction. The antimutagens were purified chromatographically while monitoring the antimutagenic activity against Trp-P-2 with a modified Ames test employing a plate method. This purification resulted in the isolation of four strong antimutagens, 5,7-dihydroxy-6,3',4'-trimethoxyflavone (eupatilin), 5, 7,4'-trihydroxy-6,3'-dimethoxyflavone (jaceosidin), 5,7, 4'-trihydroxyflavone (apigenin) and 5,7, 4'-trihydroxy-3'-methoxyflavone (chrysoeriol) from the methanol extract. These antimutagenic flavones exhibited strong antimutagenic activity against not only Trp-P-2 but also against other heterocyclic amines, such as 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4, 3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3, 8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-3-methyl-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (MeA(alpha)C) in S. typhimurium TA98. In contrast, they did not exhibit antimutagenic activity against benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO), 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 2-nitrofluorene (2-NF) or furylfuramide (AF-2) in S. typhimurium TA98, or B[a]P, 4-NQO, 2-NF, AF-2, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) or sodium azide (SA) in Salmonella typhimurium TA100, whereas they decreased the mutagenicity caused by aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) and 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA) in both of these tester strains. Regarding the structure-activity relationship, the tested flavones had distinct differences in the intensities of their antimutagenic activities according to the differences of their substitution patterns. Namely, the intensity of antimutagenic activities against Trp-P-2 decreased in the order of: 5,7,3',4'-tetrasubstituted flavones (IC(50): <0.1 mmol/plate), 5,7,4'-trisubstituted flavones (IC(50): 0.120-0.260 mmol/plate), 5,6,7,3',4'-pentasubstituted flavones (IC(50): 0.440-0. 772 mmol/plate). The four isolated flavones were also studied regarding their antimutagenic mechanisms with preincubation methods of the modified Ames test and emission spectroscopic analysis. The results suggested that all isolated flavones were desmutagens which directly inactivated Trp-P-2 or inhibited its metabolic activation.",Is gaiyou mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
265,"The mutagenicities of 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX, compound 1), 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (RMX, compound 6), and 2-(dichloromethyl)-3,3-dichloropropenal (TCB, compound 7) were determined in the same assay and in repetitive determinations using Salmonella typhimurium (TA 100) without microsomal fraction activation. In addition, the mutagenicity of 2-methyl-3,3-dichloropropenal (compound 8) was assayed in the same manner although not simultaneously with MX, RMX, and TCB. This study was undertaken to ascertain the role of open- and closed-ring forms of MX in the mutagenicity of MX. MX proved to be roughly 100 times more mutagenic than the open-ring analogue TCB and 10 times more mutagenic than the closed-ring analogue RMX. Compound 8 was inactive. Assay stability of the three active compounds in Vogel-Bonner medium at 38 degrees C was estimated as the chemical half-life values by following the change in UV absorbance at selected wave lengths. Half-life values were 10.7, 2.6, and 2.8 hr, respectively, for MX, RMX, and TCB. The enhanced mutagenicity of MX relative to RMX and TCB is attributed to the intrinsic mutagenicity of MX and its greater stability is judged to play only a minor role. Moreover, the greater mutagenicity of the closed-ring analogue RMX relative to the open-ring analogue TCB points to the ring form of MX as the active species even though the open form of MX is predominant under assay conditions.",Is RMX mutagenic for nan strain?,True
266,"The response of mutagenicity to the stepwise replacement of chlorine atoms and the hydroxyl group by hydrogen in 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX, 1) was determined in several assays by using Salmonella typhimurium tester strain (TA100). In all, eight MX derivatives were assayed. Several were studied together in at least one assay. In addition to MX, the seven included 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (RMX, 2), 3-chloro-4-(chloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (3), 3-chloro-4-(chloromethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (4), 4-(chloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (5), 4-chloromethyl-2(5H)-furanone (6), and 4-(dichloromethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (8). Compounds 1-6 were mutagenic. Compound 8 gave erratic results. 4-(Acetoxymethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (11) was nonmutagenic. The largest drop in mutagenicity amounted to a factor of about 10(2) for the replacement of the hydroxyl group or a C-3 chlorine atom from 3. Other replacements of the hydroxyl group or a C-3 or C-6 chlorine atom amounted to mutagenicity diminished by a factor of only 10. On the basis of the rates of UV spectral changes under assay conditions, chemical half-life values (ct 1/2) for 1-6 and 8 were estimated as indicators of compound stability. However, mutagenicity differences were shown to result principally from the intrinsic mutagenicities of the six compounds 1-6 rather than from differences in stability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Is RMX mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
267,"Chalcones are chemically defined as α,β-unsaturated ketones with a 1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-one nucleus. These compounds occur naturally in plants and are considered precursors of flavonoids. Given that evaluating genetic toxicology tests is essential in investigating the safe use and chemopreventive potential of different natural and synthetic compounds, this study aimed to assess the genotoxic, cytotoxic, antigenotoxic, and anticytotoxic activity of the chalcone 1E,4E-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-(2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexen-1-yl)penta-1,4-dien-3-one (CAB7β). The CAB7β was synthesized via Claisen-Schmidt reaction. The Ames test was applied using the co-treatment model as well as a micronucleus assay of mouse bone marrow with co-, pre- and post-treatment models. Our results indicate no genotoxic effect for CAB7β in any of the tests applied. At all the concentrations used, CAB7β showed a significant DNA protective effect against the mutagenic action of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide and sodium azide according to the Ames test, and against doxorubicin in the co-, pre- and post-treatment models of the micronucleus assay. CAB7β alone displayed cytotoxic activity in the micronucleus test. At concentrations of 12,5 and 50 µg/plate, CAB7β showed a moderate cytotoxic profile only in  Salmonella typhimurium  strain TA98. However, an anticytotoxic effect was observed against  S. typhimurium  strain TA100 for all the concentrations tested and during co-, pre- and post-treatment in the micronucleus assay. It was concluded that CAB7β exhibited a slightly cytotoxic effect in  S. typhimurium  strain TA98 and significant antigenotoxic and anticytotoxic effects in cells of mouse, making it a promising candidate in chemoprevention and possibly in the development of new cancer treatments.",Is CAB7β mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
268,"Perillaldehyde, a natural monocyclic terpenoid found most abundantly in the herb perilla, has a long history of use as a flavouring ingredient to add spiciness and citrus taste to foods. Previously, it was judged to be safe by several international expert panels. To confirm the safety of flavourings placed on the European Union list of flavourings, perillaldehyde was selected by the European Food Safety Authority as a representative of a subgroup of alicyclic aldehyde flavouring substances to be evaluated for genotoxic potential. Perillaldehyde was tested in a bacterial reverse mutation assay, an in vitro micronucleus assay in human lymphocytes, an HPRT assay in mouse lymphoma cells, and a micronucleus/comet assay in Han Wistar rats. In contrast to previously published results, perillaldehyde induced mutation in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of metabolic activation. The comet assay was negative for duodenum and weakly positive for liver but only at a hepatotoxic dose of perillaldehyde. All other genotoxicity assays were negative. These data do not provide an indication of any genotoxic potential for perillaldehyde, and they provide the primary basis for recent scientific opinions regarding perillaldehyde genotoxicity announced by several international organizations responsible for safety assessment of food additives and flavourings.",Is Perillaldehyde mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
269,"Inonotus obliquus is a mushroom commonly known as Chaga that is widely used in folk medicine in Siberia, North America, and North Europe. Here, we evaluated the antimutagenic and antioxidant capacities of subfractions of Inonotus obliquus extract. The ethyl acetate extract was separated by vacuum chromatography into three fractions, and the fraction bearing the highest antimutagenic activity was subsequently separated into four fractions by reversed phase (ODS-C18) column chromatography. The most antimutagenic fraction was then separated into two subfractions (subfractions 1 and 2) by normal phase silica gel column chromatography. Ames test analysis revealed that the subfractions were not mutagenic. At 50 μg/plate, subfractions 1 and 2 strongly inhibited the mutagenesis induced in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 by the directly acting mutagen MNNG (0.4 μg/plate) by 80.0% and 77.3%, respectively. They also inhibited 0.15 μg/plate 4NQO-induced mutagenesis in TA98 and TA100 by 52.6-62.0%. The mutagenesis in TA98 induced by the indirectly acting mutagens Trp-P-1 (0.15 μg/plate) and B(α)P (10 μg/plate) was reduced by 47.0-68.2% by the subfractions, while the mutagenesis in TA100 by Trp-P-1 and B(α)P was reduced by 70.5-87.2%. Subfraction 1 was more inhibitory than subfraction 2 with regard to the mutagenic effects of 4NQO, Trp-P-1, and B(α)P. Subfractions 1 and 2 also had a strong antioxidant activity against DPPH radicals and were identified by MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR analyses as 3β-hydroxy-lanosta-8, 24-dien-21-al and inotodiol, respectively. Thus, we show that the 3beta-hydroxy-lanosta-8, 24-dien-21-al and inotodiol components of Inonotus obliquus bear antimutagenic and antioxidative activities.",Is Chaga mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
270,"Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is a major source of indoor air pollution. Extractable-respirable particulate (ERP) from the ETS-contaminated indoor air (ERP-ETS) was collected from six passenger train cars and one control room. The mutagenicity of ERP-ETS was tested in the Ames/Salmonella test in the presence of male rat liver microsomal fraction S9. The mutation spectrum of ERP-ETS was determined by colony probe hybridization and polymerase chain reaction/DNA sequence analysis in approximately 2,370 His+ revertants. The results indicate that the majority of ERP-ETS-induced mutations were a two-base deletion of GC or CG within the hotspot sequence of CGCGCGCG at the frameshift hisD3052 allele in strain TA98. The ERP-ETS from the control room induced approximately 94.3% such deletions, while the ERP-ETS collected from the passenger cars induced approximately 89.6% such deletions. The ERP-ETS either from the control room or from the passenger cars induced approximately 74% C/G --> A/T transversions, and approximately 23% C/G --> T/A transitions within the primary target CCC at the hisG46 allele in strain TA100.",Is ERP-ETS mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
271,"The ability of fluoroquinolones to cause light-induced adverse effects has been established in experimental studies and clinical observations. The formation of active oxygen species appears to be responsible for this activity. Photomutagenicity tests with bacterial, lower eukaryotic and mammalian cells were performed with three fluoroquinolones (Fleroxacin, Ciprofloxacin and Lomefloxacin). After concomitant irradiation with simulated solar light (with a reduced UVB component), weak increases in the number of revertants were observed in Salmonella typhimurium TA104 and TA100. No photomutagenic activity was detected in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7. In the chromosomal aberration (CA) test with Chinese hamster V79 cells the number of aberrant metaphases was markedly increased. In the Comet assay with mouse lymphoma cells, evidence of extensive DNA breakage was obtained. All three compounds showed similar potencies in the Comet and Ames assays while there was a clear gradation of potencies in the CA assay (Lomefloxacin > Fleroxacin > Ciprofloxacin), which conformed with reports on the relative potencies regarding phototoxicity. The oxygen radical scavengers catalase, superoxide dismutase and N, N'-dimethylurea modulated the photoclastogenicity and phototoxicity but had no influence on the effects in the Comet and Ames tests. It thus appears that different kinds of mechanism are responsible for toxicity and clastogenicity on the one side and DNA breakage and gene mutation on the other side. Pre-irradiation of the test articles did not lead to enhanced genotoxicity, indicating the involvement of very short lived genotoxic agents. The results endorse the advice to avoid excessive light exposure during antibiotic therapy with fluoroquinolones.",Is Fleroxacin mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False

It is known that hydrochlorothiazide purity is a challenging problem for the pharmaceutical industry. As there were no prior mutagenicity data for the impurity salamide, the aim was to investigate its mutagenicity in this study. Salamide was tested for mutagenic potential in Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and E. coli WP2 uvrA + E. coli WP2 [pKM101] strains at six different concentrations, the highest concentration being the 5000 μg/plate.

Phthalate enhancement of the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide, 2-nitrofluorene, and benzo[a]pyrene was not observed with either test. The mutagenicity-enhancing ability may be related to the induction of enzymes such as P450IIB, that metabolize amino acid pyrolysates. By quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analysis, a good correlation was observed between the mutagenicity-enhancing activity of phthalates and their octanol-water partition coefficients.",Is phthalic acid mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
275,"Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP) is an unstable organic peroxide used in the manufacture of acrylic resins, as a hardening agent for fiberglass-reinforced plastics, and as a curing agent for unsaturated polyester resins. It is commercially available as a 40% to 60% solution in dimethyl phthalate (DMP). Because exposure to MEKP is typically through dermal contact, 2-week and 13-week toxicity studies were conducted by topical application of MEKP in DMP (45:55 w/w) to the clipped dorsal region of male and female Fischer 344/N rats and mice. Animals were evaluated for histopathology and for reproductive endpoints. In vitro genetic toxicity studies of MEKP included assessments of mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium and in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells and analysis of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In addition, the peripheral blood of mice from the 13-week study was evaluated in the micronucleus assay. In the 2-week studies, groups of 5 animals of each species and sex were administered MEKP in DMP for 5 days per week at doses of 50.6, 101.3, 202.5, 405, and 810 mg/kg body weight per day for rats and 112.5, 225, 450, 900, and 1800 mg/kg body weight per day for mice. Control groups received DMP or no treatment. No rats died during the studies, but at least 1 mouse in each group receiving MEKP died. Body weight gains of rats decreased with increasing doses of MEKP; body weight gains of mice were not affected by treatment. The primary effects of topical administration of MEKP in both rats and mice were an extensive coagulative necrosis of the epidermis and dermis, variable degrees of inflammation of the adnexa, and epidermal regeneration and hyperplasia at the application site. Lesions considered secondary to the dermal lesions included increased hematopoiesis in the spleen in rats and mice and increased myeloid hyperplasia of the bone marrow in mice, primarily at the higher doses. Mice showed a marked, dose-related increase in liver weight. In the 13-week dermal studies, groups of 10 rats and 10 mice of each sex were administered MEKP in DMP for 5 days per week at doses of 1.07, 3.57, 10.7, 35.7, and 107 mg/rat and 0.357, 1.19, 3.57, 11.9, and 35.7 mg/mouse. All high-dose mice, 3 high-dose female rats, and 1 female mouse in the 11.9 mg/animal group died or were sacrificed during the first week of the studies. Skin lesions similar to those seen in the 2-week studies were judged of sufficient severity to warrant early termination of surviving rats and mice in the 2 highest dose groups. All rats and mice in the remaining dose groups survived to the end of the studies, and weight gains were generally lower with increasing doses of MEKP. Skin lesions at the application site for the remaining animals (rats and mice) in the 10.7 mg/rat and 3.57 mg/mouse dose groups involved a spectrum of necrosis, inflammation, and acanthosis (epidermal hyperplasia). Lesions in the lower dose groups were limited to acanthosis and hyperkeratosis in rats (1.07 and 3.57 mg/rat) and acanthosis in mice (0.357 and 1.19 mg/mouse). While splenic and bone marrow lesions similar to those described in the 2-week studies were seen in animals that died early in the 13-week studies and in the rats and mice that showed ulcerative or necrotic injury, no other systemic changes were noted in animals that did not show ulcerative skin lesions. In genetic toxicity studies, MEKP in DMP (45:55 w/w) was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA1537, or TA98, with or without S9activation. A positive response was obtained in the mouse lymphoma assay for induction of trifluorothymidine resistance in L5178Y cells without S9. In cytogenetic tests with Chinese hamster ovary cells, MEKP induced sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations, with and without S9. No increase in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes was observed in peripheral blood samples obtained from male and female mice at the termination of the 13-week toxicity study. In summary, topical administration of MEKP in DM of MEKP in DMP resulted in a spectrum of necrotic, inflammatory, and regenerative skin lesions limited to the application site. Histopathologic changes in the spleen and bone marrow were also seen in rats and mice with ulcerative skin lesions, and were considered a secondary response. A no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for histopathologic skin lesions could not be determined from these studies, as lesions were observed with administration of daily doses as low as 1.07 mg for rats and 0.357 mg for mice.

276,"The mutagenic potential of dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEPH), as well as metabolites of DEHP--i.e., mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), 2-ethylhexanol (2-EH), and phthalic acid (PA)--were tested in Salmonella typhimurium cultures using the Ames test procedure. The compounds were tested on strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, and TA2637 for base-pair substitution or frameshift-type mutations. Spot tests yielded negative responses for all compounds with the strains tested. Each compound was tested for a dose-effect relationship in the TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1538 systems. DEP and DBP exhibited a mildly positive response in both TA100 and TA1535 cultures, and DMP showed a similar response in TA1535. Normalization of the data for cytotoxicity of DMP suggests TA100 has a mildly positive effect. The higher doses of these compounds exhibited some cytotoxic effects. The mutagenic effects were apparently abolished by the addition of S9 fraction in TA100 and TA1535 cultures, while no effect, other than cytotoxicity, was observed in the TA98 and TA1538 systems. DEHP, MEHP, 2-EH, and PA exhibited no mutagenicity in any of the strains of Salmonella typhimurium tested, with or without S9 metabolic activation. MEHP and 2-EH, however, exhibited a moderate cytotoxic effect in most cultures.",Is phthalic acid mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
277,"Synthetic dyes are released in wastewater from textile manufacturing plants, and many of these dyes are genotoxic. In the present study, the mutagenicity of azo, anthraquinone, and triphenyl methane dyes was investigated before and after successive biodegradation with activated sludge and the ligninolytic fungus, Irpex lacteus. Two biodegradation systems were used to reduce the genotoxicity of dyes that were not efficiently inactivated by activated sludge alone. Mutagenicity was monitored with the Salmonella reversion assay conducted with the base-pair substitution detector strains, TA100 and YG1042, and the frame-shift detector strains, TA98 and YG1041, with and without rat liver S9. All dyes except for Congo Red (CR) were mutagenic with S9 activation. Assays conducted with the dyes indicated that only the azo dye Reactive Orange 16 (RO16) was mutagenic in both TA98 and TA100. Methyl Red and Disperse Blue 3 (DB3) were mutagenic in TA98, YG1041 and YG1042, while Reactive Black 5 was mutagenic in YG1041 and YG1042. Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR), Crystal violet (CV) and Bromophenol Blue (BPB) were mutagenic only in TA98, but the toxicity of the latter two dyes complicated the evaluation of their mutagenicity. CR was not mutagenic in any of the tester strains. Biodegradation studies conducted with RO16 and DB3 indicated that the two-step biodegradation process reduced the mutagenic potential of RO16 and DB3 to a greater extent than activated sludge alone; the mutagenicity of the two dyes was reduced by 95.2% and 77.8%, respectively, by the two-step process. These data indicate that the combined biodegradation process may be useful for reducing the mutagenicity associated with wastewater from textile factories that contain recalcitrant dyes.",Is Bromophenol Blue mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
278,"Twenty-two N-nitrosamides and related compounds, including 14 nitrosoureas, 5 nitrosocarbamates, and one nitrosocyanamide, were tested at various concentrations for mutagenic activity towards Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 without the use of microsomes. The ether-water partition coefficient, solubility in water, and half-life in aqueous solution were also measured. Twenty compounds were mutagenic, with ""standard mutagenic concentrations"" (i.e. those producing 100 mutants/dish) of 0.0024--6500 micron. Standard mutagenic concentration was negatively correlated with the partition coefficient. Three compounds (ethyl 2-acetoxyethylnitrosocarbamate, nitrosocarbaryl, and methylnitrosobenzamide) were more active than the classic mutagen methylnitrosonitroguanidine. Nitrosocarbamates were at least 50 times more mutagenic than the corresponding nitrosoureas. Nitrosodihydrouracil and propylene-nitrosourea were more active than related compounds. Ethylnitrosocyanamide was 730 times more mutagenic than ethylnitrosourea. Fifteen of the test compounds (of which 14 were mutagenic) had previously been assayed in rats for carcinogenicity, all with positive results.",Is Ethylnitrosocyanamide mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
279,"Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are naturally occurring biopolyesters that have great potential in the medical field. However, the leachables resulting from sterilization process of the biomaterials may exert toxic effect including genetic damage. Here, we demonstrate that although gamma-irradiation of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-50 mol % 4-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB-co-4HB)] did not cause any change in the morphology by scanning electron microscopy, there was a significant degradation of this copolymer where the molecular weight was reduced by 37% after sterilization indicating the generation of leachables. Therefore, further investigation on the ability of the extract of this poststerilized copolymer to induce mutagenic effect was performed using Ames test (S. typhimurium strains TA1535 and TA1537) and umu test (S. typhimurium strain TA1535/pSK1002). Additionally, the capability of the extract to induce clastogenic effect was determined using Chinese hamster lung V79 fibroblast cells. Our results showed that with and without the presence of S9 metabolic activation, no mutagenic effects were observed in both Ames and umu tests when treated with P(3HB-co-4HB) extract. Similarly, treatment of P(3HB-co-4HB) extract in V79 fibroblast cells showed no significant production of micronuclei when compared with the positive control (Mitomycin C). Together, these results indicate that leachables of poststerilized P(3HB-co-4HB) cause no mutagenic and clastogenic effects.",Is Polyhydroxyalkanoates mutagenic for TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
280,"The photomutagenicity of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), all on the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) priority pollutant list, was studied. Concomitant exposing the Salmonella typhimurium bacteria strain TA102 to one of the PAHs and light (1.1 J/cm2 UVA+2.1 J/cm2 visible) without the activation enzyme S9, strong photomutagenic response is observed for anthracene, benz[a]anthracene, benzo[ghi]perylene, benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, and pyrene. Under the same conditions, acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, chrysene, and fluorene are weakly photomutagenic. Benzo[b]fluoranthene, fluoranthene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and dibenz[a,h]anthracene are not photomutagenic. These results indicate that PAHs can be activated by light and become mutagenic in Salmonella TA102 bacteria. At the same time, the mutagenicity for all the 16 PAHs was examined with the standard mutagenicity test with 10% S9 as the activation system. Benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, chrysene, acenaphthylene, and fluorene are weakly mutagenic, while the rest of the PAHs are not. In general, the photomutagenicity of PAHs in TA102 does not correlate with their S9-activated mutagenicity in either TA102 or TA98/TA100 since they involve different activation mechanisms.",Is Benzo[b]fluoranthene mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
281,"Nitrated derivatives of the aza-arenes carbazole and 2-hydroxycarbazole were synthesized and tested for mutagenicity in the Ames plate-incorporation assay. 3,6-Dinitrocarbazole was the most mutagenic towards Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 (> 100 revertants/micrograms, 25 revertants/nmol, with or without S9) followed by 2-hydroxy-1,3,6-trinitrocarbazole (24 revertants/micrograms, 7 revertants/nmol without S9) and 2-hydroxy-3-nitrocarbazole (27 revertants/micrograms, 6 revertants/nmol without S9). 2-Hydroxy-1,3-dinitrocarbazole, 1,6-dinitrocarbazole, 3-nitrocarbazole and 1-nitrocarbazole ranged from moderately to weakly active (7-1 revertants/micrograms, 2-0.3 revertants/nmol without S9). Carbazole and 2-hydroxycarbazole, and 2-hydroxy-1-nitrocarbazole, were quite inactive. Activity was generally decreased by the presence of S9, except for the dinitrocarbazoles, and was also lower in the variant TA98NR, indicating that mutagenicity was largely dependent on the presence of the 'classical' bacterial nitroreductase. The relative activities of these compounds are consistent with the hypothesis that structural features (orientation of the nitro group relative to the plane and to the long axis of the molecule, and ability to resonance-stabilize the positive charge on the arylnitrenium active electrophile intermediate) are major influences determining mutagenic potency of nitrated compounds.","Is 3,6-Dinitrocarbazole mutagenic for TA98 strain?",True
282,"Cancer is one of the most diagnosed and life threatening disease throughout the world. Nevertheless present day clinical management for cancers are surgery, radiations which are insufficient to contain the disease burden. In the past two decades, more than half of chemotherapeutic drugs developed are either directly or indirectly dependent on medicinal base phytocompounds or their derivative. The present study aims to provide the base for chemotherapeutic phytochemicals. Fagonia indica showed significant antimutagenic potential with reference to control IC 50  values were calculated as 146.33±5.2μg/ml, TA100 (AZS) 105.33±4.0μg/ml, TA98 (2AA) 113.6±5.2μg/ml followed and TA98 (AZS) 112.6±4.4 in Ames test. For this reason, the antiproliferation effect of extracts on cancer cell lines was studied through resazurin fluorescence. On HepG-2 cell lines 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) of (FIWM) was recorded as 128.3±,2.43μg/ml. On the homo sapiens epithelial cell of lung tissue (A549), the high throughput instrumental analysis of Fagonia indica depicts maximum cytotoxic effect in 30hr. The electrical impedance displays the real-time evidence about qualitative apoptosis expressed. The impedance results were supported as palmitic acid from Fagonia indica virtually that inhibits Cyclin Dependent Kinase 2 (CDKs 2) in silico molecular docking studies. Fagonia indica extract possesses substantial antimutagenic, cytotoxic and anticancer activity which supports the potential of its phytochemicals for drug development.",Is Fagonia indica mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
283,"The antioxidant and mutagenic/antimutagenic activities of the fixed oils from Nigella sativa (NSO) and Nigella damascena (NDO) seeds, obtained by cold press-extraction from the cultivar samples, were comparatively investigated for the first time. The antimutagenicity test was carried out using classical and modified Ames tests. The fatty acid composition of the fixed oils was characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) while the quantification of thymoquinone in the fixed oils was determined by UPC 2  . The main components of the NSO and NDO were found to be linoleic acid, oleic acid, and palmitic acid. The results of the Ames test confirmed the safety of NSO and NDO from the viewpoint of mutagenicity. The results of the three antioxidant test methods were correlated with each other, indicating NDO as having a superior antioxidant activity, when compared to the NSO. Both NSO and NDO exhibited a significant protective effect against the mutagenicity induced by aflatoxin B1 in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains. When microsomal metabolism was terminated after metabolic activation of the mycotoxin, a significant increase in antimutagenic activity was observed, suggesting that the degradation of aflatoxin B1 epoxides by these oils may be a possible antimutagenic mechanism. It is worthy to note that this is the first study to assess the mutagenicity of NSO and NDO according to the OECD 471 guideline and to investigate antimutagenicity of NDO in comparison to NSO against aflatoxin.",Is palmitic acid mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
284,"Treatment of foods, such as red meat and poultry, that contain palmitic acid with ionizing radiation leads to the formation of 2-dodecylcyclobutanone (2-DCB), a compound found only in irradiated foods. In this study, the Salmonella mutagenicity test and the yeast DEL assay were used to evaluate the genotoxic potential of 2-DCB. Salmonella Typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 were exposed to 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg per well of 2-DCB, with and without exogenous metabolic activation (5% S9 fraction), using the microtiter plate-based Miniscreen version of the test. 2-DCB did not induce mutations in the Salmonella mutagenicity test. When Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain RS112, which contains a nonfunctional duplication of the his3 gene that can be induced to form a functional HIS3+ gene by intrachromosomal recombination, was exposed to 0.63, 1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 mg/ml of 2-DCB, no increase in the rate of intrachromosomal (DEL) recombination was observed. The absence of genotoxicity observed in this study using purified 2-DCB agrees with the lack of genotoxic and teratogenic activity observed in previously conducted multigeneration feeding studies of laboratory animals (rats, mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits) that used radiation-sterilized poultry that contained 2-DCB as a unique radiolytic product.",Is 2-DCB mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
285,"We describe here the isolation and identification of palmitic acid as being responsible for significant anti-N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitroguanidine (MNNG) activity in yogurt. The Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA100) was used to direct fractionation of activity. Yogurt was freeze-dried and extracted with acetone to yield a crude extract. The crude extract was purified by normal phase silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, and reversed phase medium pressure liquid chromatographies. The major compound in the active medium pressure liquid chromatographic fractions was determined to be palmitic acid on GC and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems, and by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. Other saturated straight chain and methyl branched fatty acids were detected by GC/MS and were later shown to possess anti-MNNG activity. Of the straight chain fatty acids, palmitic acid had the highest anti-MNNG activity. All omega - 1 methyl branched fatty acids tested were more active than their straight chain counterparts. A trace amount of isopalmitic acid (14-methyl pentadecanoic acid), a minor milk lipid, was detected in one of the active fractions, and was later shown to be five times more active than palmitic acid. Isopalmitic acid also inhibited mutagenesis induced 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4NQO), and 7, 12-dimethyl benz[a]anthracene (DMBA), and was found to inhibit the metabolic activation of DMBA.",Is Isopalmitic acid mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
286,"Eight structurally related halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons mono-, di- and trichloroacetaldehyde (the last in the anhydrous and hydrate form), moni-, di- and trichloroethanol and allyl chloride, were tested for their ability to induce gene mutations in prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms. The genetic systems employed were the Salmonella reversion test with strain TA1535 and TA100, with and without metabolic activation, a forward and a back-mutation system in S. coelicolor and two forward mutation systems in A. nidulans. Each compound was tested with the spot and plate incorporation assay techniques. Mono-, di- and trichloroacetaldehyde were mutagenic in all the microorganisms employed; all the halogenated ethanols were positive in A. nidulans, while in S. typhimurium and in S. coelicolor the only active forms were respectively the mono- and dichloroderivatives. Allyl chloride was active in S. typhimurium and S. coelicolor and negative in A. nidulans. The technical approach as well as the complex influence of different factors (toxicity, volatility and stability) on the genetic response of each of the compounds under test did not allow to obtain more than a qualitative relationship between mutagenic potency and chemical structure.",Is Allyl chloride mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
287,"The polychlorinated pesticide toxaphene has been identified as a persistent environmental contaminant and is of particular concern in the Great Lakes and Arctic regions of Canada. Inconsistencies in published in vitro genotoxicology studies have hindered risk assessments of toxaphene exposure. When toxaphene mutagenicity was re-evaluated in the Ames Salmonella/microsome assay at 10-10,000 microg/plate, a dose-dependent increase in His revertants occurred in all five strains of S. typhimurium tested (TA97, TA98, TA100, TA102 and TA104) with higher mutation frequencies observed in the absence of S9 metabolic activation. However, the mutagenic potential of toxaphene was relatively low with concentrations greater than 500 microg/plate required to induce mutation. Toxaphene genotoxicity was also examined in a mammalian system using Chinese hamster V79 lung fibroblasts with metabolic activation provided by human HepG2 hepatoma cells. Genotoxicity of 1-10 microg/ml toxaphene was examined by measuring the frequency of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and mutation induction at the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) gene locus. Although small increases in SCE were observed at toxic concentrations of toxaphene approaching the LD50 (10 microg/ml), they were not found to be statistically significant relative to control. Toxaphene was also unable to induce HGPRT mutagenesis at the concentrations tested. These results show that while toxaphene is a weak, direct-acting mutagen in the Ames Salmonella Test, convincing evidence of dose-dependent SCE induction and mutagenicity at the HGPRT gene locus could not be demonstrated in V79 cells.",Is Toxaphene mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
288,"Benomyl (methyl [1-[(butylamino)carbonyl]-1H-benzimidazol-2- yl]carbamate) and its major metabolite carbendazim (methyl 2-benzimidazolecarbamate) are major agricultural systemic fungicides. These compounds inhibit fungal microtubular function and thereby cause nondisjunction of chromosomes at cell division. Several investigators have proposed that these compounds can also cause gene mutations (base-pair substitutions). In this laboratory, no mutagenic activity was observed with either benomyl (analytical grade) or Benlate (samples tested up to 500 and 1200 micrograms/plate, respectively, the limit of cytotoxicity) in the Salmonella/Ames plate-incorporation test in either base-pair substitution (TA100 and TA1535) or frameshift-sensitive (TA98 and TA1537) strains with or without S9 metabolic activation. However, some carbendazim preparations caused mutations in frameshift-sensitive strains at very high concentrations (> or = 5000 micrograms/plate) with metabolic activation. The mutagenic activity was not due to the major carbendazim metabolite, methyl (5-hydroxy-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)carbamate (5-OH MBC), since 5-OH MBC was not mutagenic with (up to 20,000 micrograms/plate) or without (up to 16,000 micrograms/plate) activation. Subsequently, two highly mutagenic contaminants, 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP) and 2-amino-3-hydroxyphenazine (AHP) were detected in mutagenic carbendazim samples. In those samples, DAP and AHP contaminant levels ranged as high as 46.5 and 11.6 ppm, respectively. No evidence of mutagenicity could be detected in preparations in which the DAP content was < 1.8 ppm. The mutagenic activity of these two contaminants was further investigated in strain TA98. Without activation, DAP and AHP were positive at test concentrations as low as 5 and 10 micrograms/plate, respectively. In the presence of S9, mutations were detected at much lower concentrations (beginning at 0.025 and 0.05 microgram/plate, respectively). These results indicate that carbendazim samples containing DAP or AHP at levels as low as 5 or 10 ppm, respectively, would be positive in the Salmonella/Ames test with activation when tested at 5000 micrograms/plate. Purified carbendazim is not mutagenic.",Is DAP mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
289,"Amsacrine, an acridine derivative used clinically in the treatment of acute leukaemia, has formed the basis for the development of further compounds with high activity against experimental solid tumours, one of which is currently in clinical trial. We have compared the ability of these drugs to cause point mutations in bacteria, 'petite' mutations in yeast and mutations in mammalian cells. Several of the compounds are frameshift mutagens in Salmonella typhimurium TA1537 while some cause 'petite' mutagenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. All are highly clastogenic and have significant mutagenic activity at the 6-thioguanine locus in cultured V79 Chinese hamster fibroblasts following 1 h drug exposures. None are mutagenic at the ouabain locus of these cells. The relationship between different indicators of mutagenicity has been studied using an additional set of amsacrine analogues, some of which are mutagenic in S. typhimurium TA98. There is a highly significant relationship between mutation frequency (measured as resistance to 6-thioguanine) and either cytotoxicity (D37 values in a clonogenic assay) or clastogenicity (ability to induce micronuclei). However, there is no correlation with mutagenicity in microbial systems. The results suggest that the cytotoxicity, clastogenicity and mutagenic activity of the amsacrine analogues is mediated by similar mechanisms, probably involving the enzyme DNA topoisomerase II.",Is Amsacrine mutagenic for TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
290,"Amsacrine is a DNA intercalating agent with antineoplastic properties in lymphoproliferative disorders. This report describes a group of short-term tests with multiple endpoints to characterize the mutagenic and carcinogenic properties of this drug. In vitro studies included bacterial and mammalian cell mutagenesis, and sister-chromatid exchange and chromosome aberrations in mammalian cells. In vivo, mice were given amsacrine for 7 wk at 2, 5, and 10 mg/kg and were observed for an additional 17 wk. The standard bacterial assay revealed cytotoxicity at 2000 and 5000 micrograms/plate in the preincubation assay. No significant increase in revertants occurred in Salmonella strains, except for TA1537 in the activation phase. Amsacrine at 4.0 micrograms/ml was cytotoxic to V-79 cells in the cell mutation assay, and at lower dose levels was a direct-acting mutagen for the HGPRT locus. Sister-chromatid exchange rate of Chinese hamster ovary cells was increased more than twofold at 2 micrograms/ml without metabolic activation. Cell anomalies included changes in metaphase cell kinetics and chromosome damage. Mice in the lung adenoma bioassay failed to show increased numbers of tumors, while indicating lack of tolerance and survival beyond 5 mg/kg. The results indicate clear genotoxicity to mammalian cell systems with a spectrum of changes from point mutation and SCE induction to cell-cycle alterations, irrespective of exogenous metabolic activation. These results corroborate previous findings in animal and human cell systems in vitro. The reduction of genotoxicity in bacterial assays after exogenous metabolic activation may suggest some detoxification, and the magnitude of effects observed in mammalian cells indicates that exogenous metabolic activation is not required to manifest amsacrine's activity. The lack of tumor-inducing potential in mice may be attributed to strong cytotoxic effects in this species, or to an insensitivity of the target organ, or to assay systems that may mask the carcinogenic potential.",Is Amsacrine mutagenic for TA1537 strain?,False
291,"Chloropicrin (CCl3NO2) is a major soil fumigant for control of fungi, insects and nematodes and may by formed by chlorination of drinking water. It is also a strong lacrimator and induces sister chromatid exchanges in cultured human lymphocytes. Mutagenicity assays of CCl3NO2 in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 establish that it is toxic but not mutagenic at 500 nmol/plate but becomes mutagenic but not toxic on addition of S9 (previous work) or 1-2 molar equivalents of glutathione (GSH) (this study). The preincubation assay is superior to the plate incorporation test giving 2-4-fold higher revertants/nmol. Using the preincubation assay with GSH at 5 mM (a biomimetic level) in the top agar gives linear dose-response relationships for CCl3NO2 and its dechlorination products CHCl2NO2 and CH2ClNO2 with 0.56, 0.56 and 1.8 revertants/nmol, respectively. The mutagenicity values for CHCl2NO2 and CH2ClNO2 are the same in the presence and the absence of GSH, which only improves the linearity at high levels by reducing toxicity to the bacteria. GSH activation of CCl3NO2 mutagenicity may be due to reductive dechlorination of the trichloro compound to the more active CHCl2NO2 and CH2ClNO2. Alternatively, the mutagenicity may result from an intermediate GSH conjugate such as GSCCl2NO2 or GSCHClNO2. In comparison, the mutagenicity of CH2Br2 and CH2I2 is affected little if any by addition of GSH and these dihalomethanes are much less active than the halonitromethane series. It therefore appears that CCl3NO2 is not mutagenic in the absence of activation and that the dechlorinated metabolites CHCl2NO2 and CH2ClNO2 are moderately potent bacterial mutagens, consistent with the possible genotoxicity of CCl3NO2 in mammals.",Is Chloropicrin mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True

These chemicals were not mutagenic either before or after activation with rat and woodchuck microsomal and cytosolic enzymes. However, tannic acid mixture and tannic acid fraction both gave a significantly (p = 0.05) dose-related reduction in the number of the revertant colonies, compared to the normal spontaneous revertants with no apparent toxic effects in the background lawn.

294,"The antimutagenicity of ethanol extracts of bee glue (propolis) (EEBG) was evaluated, using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 as a test model, against two direct mutagens, 4-nitro-O-phenylenediamine (4-NO) and 1-nitropyrene (1-NP), and two indirect mutagens, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) with S9 mix. EEBG was shown to suppress the mutagenicity of these compounds in a dose-dependent fashion. To delineate the mechanism of action of the antimutagenic effects of EEBG on the two indirect mutagens IQ and B[a]P, two possible points of blocking were considered: (1) cytochrome P-450 activity (route 1) and (2) interaction with microsome-generated proximate mutagens to generate an inactive complex (route 2). Our results clearly demonstrated, at a very low dose, remarkable suppression of the mutagenicity of both compounds by inhibiting either route 1 or route 2 pathway. Further studies indicated that EEBG was capable of inhibiting both the activities of hepatic cytochrome P-450 IA1-linked 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and IA 2-linked 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase (ECD) in a similar dose-dependent manner. Taken together, we demonstrated that EEBG was a good inhibitor for mutagenicity of direct mutagens, 1-NP and 4-NO, as well as for the indirect mutagens IQ and B[a]P in the presence of S9 mix via inactivation of microsomal enzyme activities (e.g. EROD and ECD) or antagonizing metabolic generation of the proximate mutagens of IQ and B[a]P.",Is 4-NO mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

The relative order of activity among nitro and its reduction products, 4-N = 0 and 4-NHOH in TA98 and TA100 was 4-N = 0 > 4-NHOH > AcNDE. In nitroreductase deficient strain TA98NR, AcNDE was inactive, but expressed a slight activity in TA100NR while 4-N = 0 and 4-NHOH showed a large increase in specific activity in both the strains. In O-acetyltransferase deficient strain TA98/1,8-DNP6, AcNDE was inactive, while 4-N = O and 4-NHOH showed a sharp fall in activity. The hydroxylamine derived products with an activity order 4-N(OAc)Ac > 4-N(OH)CHO > 4-N(OH)Ac in both TA98 and TA100, showed 3-6 times increase in the specific activity for the latter two compounds in the presence of S9 mix, which was inhibited in the presence of paraoxan, indicating N-deacylation as an important metabolic activation pathway. Except the 4-NO in TA100, the observed mutagenicity of nitroscante (NSC) was higher than those of potential metabolites and the nor-isothiocyanato derivative 4'-nitrodiphenyl ether, thereby showing that -NCS function has a potentiating effect on the mutagenicity of this drug.",Is nitroscante mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
296,"There is a need to enhance the production of bioactive secondary metabolites and to establish new production systems, e.g., for liver-protective compounds of  Silybum marianum  seeds. Quantifying and identifying the produced phytochemicals, and examining their protective effects against genotoxic agents, is of great interest. This study established a protocol for the qualitative and quantitative production of hepatoprotective compounds in cotyledon-derived  Silybum marianum  callus through optimized supplementation of the MS medium with the growth regulators 2,4-D, benzylaminopurine, myoinositol, and asparagine. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) allowed for identification and quantification of the produced compounds. None of the growth medium combinations supported a detectable production of silymarin. Instead, the generated calli accumulated phenolic acids, in particular chlorogenic acid and dicaffeoylquinic acid, as revealed by HPLC and mass spectrometric analysis. 4-Nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD) was employed in the AMES-test with  Salmonella typhimurium  strain TA98 because it is a potent mutagen for this strain. Results revealed that callus extract had a high anti-genotoxic activity with respect to standard silymarin but more evident with respect seed extract. The callus produced chlorogenic acid and dicaffeoylquinic acid, which revealed higher bioactivity than silymarin. Both compounds were not formed or could not be detected in the seeds of  Silybum marianum  Egyptian ecotype.",Is 4-Nitro-o-phenylenediamine mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
297,"The in vitro antimutagenic and DNA protecting potential of organic (methanol, hexane, n-butanol) and aqueous extract/fractions of Parkinsonia aculeata L. (Fabaceae) was investigated by employing Ames assay and DNA nicking assay. DNA damage by hydroxyl radicals was effectively inhibited by all the extract/fractions. A marked antimutagenic effect was observed against 4-Nitro-o-phenylenediamine and sodium azide (direct acting mutagens) and 2-Aminofluorene (indirect acting mutagen) in TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium. In Ames assay, two different modes of experiments i.e. pre-incubation and co-incubation were performed and it was observed that all the extract/fractions showed better results in the pre-incubation as compared to co- incubation mode. Out of all the extract/fractions tested, n-butanol fraction was found to be the most effective in preventing DNA damage and inhibiting mutagenesis. UHPLC analysis of extract/fractions revealed presence of polyphenols such as gallic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, umbelliferone, coumaric acid, rutin, and ellagic acid etc. DNA protecting and antimutagenic activity of this plant could be attributed to presence of these polyphenols. The results of this study indicate the presence of potent antioxidant factors in Parkinsonia aculeata L, which are being explored further for their mechanism of action.

298,"To ascertain the in vitro genotoxicity of danthron and its potential mechanism of action, we performed an Ames test, a cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay and a comet assay in Balb/c 3T3 cells. The Ames test revealed that danthron was mutagenic only toward Salmonella typhimurium strain TA102 in the presence of an exogenous metabolic activation system (S9 mix). Danthron (25, 50 and 100μg/ml) increased the frequencies of micronuclear cells with or without S9 mix, and the comet length, tail length and Olive tail moment in comet assays without S9 mix in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrated the in vitro genotoxicity of danthron and that 3T3 cells are capable of activating danthron. When NADP was replaced by NAD in the S9 mix, danthron remained mutagenic toward strain TA102. The addition of dicoumarol, a DT-diaphorase inhibitor, decreased the number of danthron-induced histidine revertants by 35-39%, indicating that DT-diaphorase is involved in the metabolic activation of danthron in the presence of NADH as an electron donor. In 3T3 cells, increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels as well as a reduction in GSH levels were induced by danthron in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that oxidative stress may be a major contributing pathway in the genotoxicity of danthron.",Is Danthron mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True
299,"Unsubstituted anthraquinone, 4 substituted anthraquinones (emodin, danthron, physcion, a new compound M-108-C) and 3 dimers (skyrin, rugulosin, rugulin) were tested using the Ames/Salmonella assay (strains TA98, TA100, TA1537 and TA102). Danthron and emodin were found to be mutagenic for TA1537 with or without metabolic activation, physcion only with metabolic activation. A significant difference was found between the mutagenic activities of emodin (16.2 His+/nmole) and danthron (6.5 His+/nmole) as well as a high specific mutagenic activity for physcion (11.6 His+/nmole). These results on structure-mutagenic activity relationships suggest that the 6-methyl group plays an important role in the mutagenic activity after metabolic activation. Furthermore, and contrary to emodin, physcion exhibited a weak mutagenic activity for TA102, probably due to the formation of a different metabolite. Such information is necessary to evaluate the potential carcinogenic hazard of these compounds.",Is Danthron mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 or TA1537 strain?,True
300,"Diazeniumdiolates are under investigation as possible prodrugs of the multifaceted bioregulatory agent nitric oxide. This study was undertaken to assess further the mutagenic potential of two diazeniumdiolates, DEA/NO (Et2N[N(O)NO]Na) and SPER/NO ([H2N(CH2)3NH(CH2)4N[N(O)NO-](CH2)3 NH3+]), which generate NO spontaneously with half-lives at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4 of 2 and 39 min, respectively. The genotoxic potential of these compounds was investigated with the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay, two mammalian cell gene mutation assays (CHO/HGPRT and L5178Y TK+/-), and an assay for sister chromatid exchange (SCE) using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Both diazeniumdiolates had previously been shown to be mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella plate assay. In the experiments reported here, Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535 was exposed to the compounds in a liquid incubation assay for either 15 min or 48 h without an S-9 fraction. With the 15-min exposure, DEA/NO was mutagenic at concentrations of 0.625 mM (3.5 x control) and greater, while SPER/NO was mutagenic at 0.5 mM (2.7 x control) and above. In the CHO/HGPRT assay, DEA/NO was weakly mutagenic only at the highest concentration used, 20 mM, inducing a mutant frequency per survivor that was 2.5 x control, while SPER/NO was mutagenic at 0.5 mM with a mutant frequency of 2.5 x control. When the CHO cells were given 10 repetitive 20 mM DEA/NO exposures (3 min each), HGPRT mutant frequency was 4.1 x control. In the L5178Y mouse lymphoma cell TK+/- assay, DEA/NO doubled the mutation rate at 1.82 mM, while SPER/NO's mutation frequency was more than twice that of control at 0.63 mM. DEA/NO was positive in the SCE assay without metabolic activation, yielding significant SCE at 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mM that was 1.8, 2.2, and 2.6 times control, respectively. SPER/NO increased the SCE by 1.2, 1.4, and 1.3 times at 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mM. The results suggest that the two diazeniumdiolates, although mutagenic in the bacteria, are much weaker mutagens in mammalian cells.",Is DEA/NO mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
301,"Leptolyngbya  sp. KIOST-1 (LK1) is a newly isolated cyanobacterium that shows no obvious cytotoxicity and contains high protein content for both human and animal diets. However, only limited information is available on its toxic effects. The purpose of this study was to validate the safety of LK1 powder. Following Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines, a single-dose oral toxicity test in Sprague Dawley rats was performed. Genotoxicity was assessed using a bacterial reverse mutation test with  Salmonella typhimurium  (strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537) and  Escherichia coli  WP2  uvrA , an in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration test using Chinese hamster lung cells, and an in vivo mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus test using Hsd:ICR (CD-1) SPF mouse bone marrow. After LK1 administration (2,500 mg/kg), there were no LK1-related body weight changes or necropsy findings. The reverse mutation test showed no increased reverse mutation upon exposure to 5,000 μg/plate of the LK1 powder, the maximum tested amount. The chromosome aberration test and micronucleus assay demonstrated no chromosomal abnormalities and genotoxicity, respectively, in the presence of the LK1 powder. The absence of physiological findings and genetic abnormalities suggests that LK1 powder is appropriate as a candidate biomass to be used as a safe food ingredient.",Is LK1 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
302,"Hydrogen-dissolved water has been suggested to be effective for alleviating the oxidative stress. In the present study, neutral-pH hydrogen-enriched electrolyzed water (NHE-water; dissolved hydrogen: 0.90-1.14 parts per million [ppm]; oxido-reduced potential: -150 approximately -80 mV), which was prepared with a water-electrolysis apparatus equipped with a non-diaphragm cell and a highly compressed activated-carbon block, was evaluated for the mutagenic and genotoxic potentials, at concentrations up to 100% dose/plate, and for the subchronic toxicity. NHE-water did not induce reverse mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA98 and TA1537, and Escherichia coli strain WP2uvrA, in either the absence or presence of rat liver S9 for exogenous metabolic activation. Similarly, NHE-water did not induce chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells (CHL/IU), in short-term (6-hour) tests, with or without rat liver S9, or in a continuous treatment (24-hour) test. To evaluate the subchronic toxicity, Crj:CD(SD) specific pathogen free (SPF)-rats were administered with NHE-water at a dose of 20 mL/kg/day for 28 days via intragastric infusion. NHE-water-related toxic changes were not seen in terms of any items such as clinical symptoms, body weight, food consumption, urinalysis, hematology, blood chemistry, necropsy, each organ weight and histopathology. Thus, the no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for NHE-water was estimated to be greater than 20 mL/kg/day under the conditions examined, demonstrating the consistency with the expected safety for a human with a body weight of 60 kg to drink the NHE-water up to at least 1.2 L/day.",Is NHE-water mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or WP2uvrA or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
303,"Touchi, a traditional Chinese food used mainly for seasoning is obtained by first steaming soybeans followed by fermentation with Aspergillus oryzae (koji). A series of toxicological studies was conducted to evaluate the mutagenic and genotoxic potential and subchronic toxicity of a water extract of Touchi, a known inhibitor of alpha -glucosidase activity. Touchi extract (TE) did not induce reverse mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA1537, TA100, TA1535, and Escherichia coli WP2uvrA at concentrations up to 5000 microg/plate, in either the absence or presence of exogenous metabolic activation. No deaths occurred and no abnormal clinical signs were observed in any animal in any group in an in vivo micronucleus test, and TE was devoid of clastogenic activity when administered orally to mice at doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day. Thus, TE was evaluated as negative in the bacterial reverse mutation and mouse bone marrow micronucleus tests under the conditions of these assays. To evaluate its subchronic toxicity, SPF rats were administered TE at doses of 0, 250, 1000, and 2500 mg/kg/day via oral gastric intubation. No treatment-related toxic changes were seen in clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, urinalysis, hematology, blood chemistry, necropsy, organ weight, or histopathology. The no observed adverse effect level for TE was thus considered to be more than 2500 mg/kg/day in both males and females. These results are consistent with Touchi's status as a traditional Chinese food derived from fermented soybeans and its purported long history of use. Specifically, these data are consistent with the expected safety of human consumption of TE up to at least 5 g/day.",Is Touchi extract mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or WP2uvrA or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
304,"Levels of 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) were determined in both striated muscle (fillets) and whole body extracts of fish specimens harvested during a two-year period (1987-1989) from the Pigeon River (between Hartford and Newport) of Eastern Tennessee (USA). Whole body (wet weight) fish extract levels as high as 117 micrograms/kg body weight and composite fish fillet (wet weight) extract levels as high as 87 micrograms/kg fillet weight were observed. Pure TCDD was found to be highly toxic to the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, and TA100 at dosages which exceeded 825 ng TCDD/ml in the top agar of the Ames Salmonella assay. An 825 ng/ml TCDD dosage was not mutagenic to any of the tested Salmonella strains, either with or without metabolic activation (S9 mix). However, when acidic fish extracts from the Pigeon River were tested for mutagenicity, most of the fish extracts were mutagenic to Salmonella strains TA97, TA98, and TA100. These mutagenic extracts also demonstrated mutagenic dose-response curves. Other chemicals within the extracts as well as synergistic effects may account for the mutagenicity.",Is TCDD mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
305,"An in vitro microbial assay system employing two histidine-dependent strains of Salmonella typhimurium, TA1535 and TA100, was used to test the mutagenicities of enflurane, methoxyflurane, isoflurane and fluroxene. Enflurane, isoflurane and fluroxene in concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 30 per cent and methoxyflurane in concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 7 per cent were incubated with bacteria in the presence or absence of homogenates of liver prepared from rats pretreated with the enzyme inducer, Aroclor 1254. Enflurane, methoxyflurane, isoflurane, and urines from patients anesthetized with these agents were not mutagenic. Fluroxene, however, was highly mutagenic, and therefore poses a possible hazard for operating room personnel and patients.",Is Fluroxene mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
306,"The Salmonella/microsome assay with strains TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102 was used to examine the potential mutagenicity and structure-activity of 16 mono- and di-halogenated pyridines. The chemical reactivity of the halopyridines suggests that nucleophilic displacement of halogens can occur with halogens at positions 2, 4 and 6 being displaced in addition-elimination reactions. 2-Chloropyridine gave a positive result with rat-liver metabolic activation, and 2-fluoropyridine gave equivocal results under these conditions. Mutagenic responses were also obtained with 2-chloromethyl pyridine and 3-chloromethyl pyridine, in both the presence and absence of rat-liver S9. These results suggest that the halogenated pyridines, especially with halogens at the 2-position, and singly on a methyl substituent, have mutagenic activity in the Salmonella assay.",Is 2-Chloropyridine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
307,"Antioxidant properties of 2,3,5,7,8-pentahydroxy-6-ethyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (echinochrome A) were linked with the scavenging of peroxy radicals in liposomes, trapping of superoxide anion radicals, and binding of ferrous ions to inactive complexes in the aqueous phase. The antioxidant property of 6-ethyl-2,3,7-trimethoxy-5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (trimethoxyechinochrome A) was negligible. Autooxidation of echinochrome A was increased in basic media according to the degree of its dissociation. Autooxidation of polyvalent anions in basic media was accompanied by generation of naphthosemiquinone and superoxide anion radicals as free radical intermediates. An increased rate of echinochrome A autooxidation was noted in the presence of calcium ions. This was explained by a shift of pK of Ca2+-echinochrome A complexes toward acidic pH comparably with echinochrome A. Echinochrome A possessed pronounced mutagenic activity, while trimethoxyechinochrome A was inactive in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome reverse mutation assay (Ames test) for all examined cells (TA98, TA100, TA1537). Comparison of the chemical and biological activity of echinochrome A and trimethoxyechinochrome A demonstrated the key role of the beta-hydroxyl groups in the 2nd, 3rd, and 7th naphthol cycle positions. The O2-* and naphthosemiquinone radicals generated in the redox transition of 2,3-oxygroups may be the reason for the strongly pronounced mutagenicity of echinochrome A.",Is Echinochrom mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1537 strain?,True
308,"Chloral hydrate is widely used as a sedative and a hypnotic in pediatric medicine. It is also a byproduct of water chlorination. Chloral hydrate has been shown to be genotoxic in numerous prokaryotic and eukaryotic assay systems including human lymphocytes in vitro. One of its metabolites, trichloroacetic acid, has demonstrated hepatocarcinogenic activity in mice. Trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene, both of which are metabolized to chloral hydrate, have been shown to be carcinogenic in rats and/or mice. Because of this evidence of carcinogenicity and because of the wide-spread use of chloral hydrate, 16- or 17-day range-finding toxicity studies and separate 16- or 17-day metabolism studies were performed in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice in preparation for further long-term rodent studies. In addition, in vitro studies of the metabolism and DNA-binding capacity of chloral hydrate and its metabolites were performed. Genetic toxicity studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, Drosophila melanogaster, and mouse bone marrow cells. For the range-finding studies, groups of eight male and eight female F344/N Nctr BR rats and B6C3F1/Nctr BR (C57BL/6N x C3H/HeN MTV-) mice were administered 0, 50, 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg chloral hydrate per kg body weight in water by gavage 5 days per week for 17 days (rats) or 16 days (mice) for a total of 12 doses. One male rat receiving 800 mg/kg died after five doses. Two 800 mg/kg female rats died after dosing ended but before study termination. One male mouse in each group except the 400 mg/kg group died before the end of the study. Two 800 mg/kg female mice also died before the end of the study. The final mean body weight of 800 mg/kg male rats and the mean body weight gains of 400 and 800 mg/kg males were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls. The mean body weight gains of all groups of dosed male mice were significantly greater than that of the vehicle control group. The only clinical finding in rats and mice attributed to chloral hydrate treatment was light sedation in the 400 mg/kg groups and heavy sedation in the 800 mg/kg groups; sedation subsided within 30 minutes or 3 hours, respectively. The liver weights of 400 mg/kg male mice and 800 mg/kg male and female mice were significantly greater than those of the vehicle control groups. No chemical-related lesions were observed in rats or mice. Male and female rats and mice were administered a single dose of 50 or 200 mg chloral hydrate per kg body weight in water by gavage, or 12 doses of 50 or 200 mg/kg over 17 days (rats) or 16 days (mice). Plasma concentrations of chloral hydrate and its metabolites were determined 15 minutes, 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours, and 2, 4, 8, and 16 days after receiving 1 or 12 doses. Maximum concentrations of chloral hydrate were observed at the initial sampling point of 15 minutes. By 1 hour, the concentrations had dropped substantially, and by 3 hours, chloral hydrate could not be detected in rats or mice. Trichloroacetic acid was the major metabolite detected in the plasma. In rats, the concentrations rose slowly, with the peaks occurring between 1 and 6 hours after treatment. In mice, the peak concentrations were found 1 hour after dosing. The concentrations then slowly decreased such that by 2 days the metabolite could no longer be detected in rats or mice. Trichloroethanol was assayed both as the free alcohol and its glucuronide. In rats, the maximum concentrations of free trichloroethanol occurred at 15 minutes, while the peak concentrations of trichloroethanol glucuronide were found at 1 hour; by 3 hours, concentrations of both metabolites approached background levels. In mice, the maximum concentrations of both metabolites occurred at 15 minutes, and by 1 to 3 hours concentrations approached background levels. The plasma concentrations of chloral hydrate and its metabolites were dose dependent in rats and mice. In mice, plasma concentrations of trichloroacetic acid were significantly higher after a single dose than after 12 doses. None of the metabolic parameters appears to account for species differences that may exist in hepatocarcinogenicity. The data from the study of metabolism and DNA adduct formation indicated that in vitro metabolism of 200 microM to 5 mM chloral hydrate by male B6C3F1 mouse liver microsomes (control microsomes) generated free radical intermediates that resulted in endogenous lipid peroxidation, forming malondialdehyde, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propionaldehyde. Similar concentrations of trichloroacetic acid and trichloroethanol, the primary metabolites of chloral hydrate, also generated free radicals and induced lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation induced by trichloroacetic acid nearly equaled that induced by chloral hydrate, while that from trichloroethanol was three- to fourfold less. Metabolism of 200 microM to 5 mM chloral hydrate, trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroethanol by liver microsomes of B6C3F1 mice pretreated with pyrazole (pyrazole-induced microsomes) yielded lipid peroxidation products at concentrations two- to threefold greater than those from liver microsomes of untreated mice. Additionally, chloral hydrate-induced lipid peroxidation catalyzed by control and pyrazole-induced microsomes was reduced significantly by 2,4-dichloro-6-phenylphenoxyethylamine, a general cytochrome P450 inhibitor. Human lymphoblastoid transgenic cells expressing cytochrome P(450)2E1 metabolized 200 to 5,000 micrograms/mL chloral hydrate to reactants inducing mutations, whereas the parental cell line was inactive. The malondialdehyde-modified DNA adduct, 3-(2-deoxy-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)pyrimido[1,2 alpha]purin-10(3H)-one (MDA-MG-1), formed from the metabolism of 1 mM chloral hydrate, trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroethanol by control B6C3F1 mouse liver microsomes, mouse pyrazole-induced microsomes, male F344/N rat liver microsomes, and human liver microsomes in the presence and absence of calf thymus DNA was also determined. When incubated in the absence of calf thymus DNA, the amount of malondialdehyde formed from metabolism by pyrazole-induced mouse microsomes was twice that from rat or human liver microsomes. Amounts of chloral hydrate-induced and trichloroacetic acid-induced lipid peroxidation products formed from metabolism by rat and human liver microsomes were similar, and these quantities were about twice those formed from the metabolism of trichloroethanol. The quantity of MDA-MG-1 formed from the metabolism of chloral hydrate, trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroethanol by mouse, rat, and human liver microsomes exhibited a linear correlation with the quantity of malondialdehyde formed under incubation conditions in the absence of calf thymus DNA. Chloral hydrate was shown to be mutagenic in vitro and in vivo. At doses from 1,000 to 10,000 micrograms/plate, it induced mutations in S. typhimurium strain TA100, with and without S9 activation; an equivocal response was obtained in S. typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of S9, and no mutagenicity was detected with strain TA1535 or TA1537. Chloral hydrate at doses from 1,700 to 5,000 micrograms/mL induced sister chromatid exchanges; at doses from 1,000 to 3,000 micrograms/mL, chromosomal aberrations were induced in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with and without S9. Results of a sex-linked recessive lethal test in D. melanogaster were unclear; administration of chloral hydrate by feeding produced an inconclusive increase in recessive lethal mutations, results of the injection experiment were negative. An in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test with chloral hydrate at doses from 125 to 500 mg/kg gave a positive dose trend. In summary, due to the absence of chloral hydrate-induced histopathologic lesions in rats and mice, no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) were based on body weights of rats and liver weights of mice. The NOAELs for rats and mice were 200 mg/kg. Chloral hydrate was rapidly metabolized by rats and mice, with trichloroacetic acid occurring as the major metabolite. Peak concentrations of trichloroacetic acid occurred more quickly in mice. Plasma concentrations of chloral hydrate were dose dependent, but metabolic rates were unaffected by dose or sex. Chloral hydrate was mutagenic in vitro and in vivo. Metabolism of chloral hydrate and its metabolites produced free radicals that resulted in lipid peroxidation in liver microsomes of mice, rats, and humans. Induction of cytochrome P(450)2E1 by pyrazole increased the concentrations of lipid peroxidation products; inhibition of cytochrome P(450)2E1 by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine reduced these concentrations. Metabolism of chloral hydrate and its metabolites by mouse, rat, and human liver microsomes formed malondialdehyde, and in the presence of calf thymus DNA formed the DNA adduct MDA-MG-1.",Is Chloral hydrate mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
309,"DNA alkylating agents such as 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (SDMH) and azoxymethane (AOM) are potent carcinogens and are widely used to induce colon tumors in experimental animals. However, standard bacterial mutagenesis assays have failed to detect the mutagenic effects of these chemicals. Using derivatives of a set of Escherichia coli test strains developed by Cupples and Miller (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86, 5345, 1989), we hve demonstrated that under two conditions, SDMH and AOM induced point mutations by several-fold in a dose-dependent manner: (i) of six possible base substitutions, they only induced GC-->AT transitions; and (ii) the cells must be deficient in O6-methylguanine (O6MeG) DNA methyltransferase (MTase) activity. SDMH and AOM up to 200 microg/ml were unable to induce His+ revertants in a Salmonella Ames test strain TA1535 (GC-->AT); however, in the absence of mammalian S9 extract, His+ revertants increased up to 55-fold upon treatment of an isogenic Salmonella strain deficient in MTase activity. These results indicate that SDMH and AOM are indeed bacterial mutagens and that lesions induced by them are the target of DNA repair MTases, which probably include mutagenic and carcinogenic lesions such as O6MeG. Furthermore, variable responses of bacterial species to SDMH- and AOM-induced mutagenicity suggests a difference either in the metabolism of potential mutagens or in the repair of specific lesions. Since O6MeG is not only a mutagenic lesion but also a lethal lesion if left unrepaired, we compared the mutagenicity and toxicity of SDMH and AOM with an SN-type methylating carcinogen. N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, and conclude that SDMH and AOM are weak bacterial mutagens.",Is AOM mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
310,"Halonitromethanes (HNMs) are a recently identified class of disinfection by-products (DPBs) in drinking water that are mutagenic in Salmonella and potent inducers of DNA strand breaks in mammalian cells. Here we compared the mutagenic potencies of the HNMs to those of their halomethane (HM) homologues by testing all nine HNMs and seven of the nine HMs (minus bromomethane and chloromethane) under the same conditions (the pre-incubation assay) in Salmonella TA100 +/- S9. We also determined the mutation spectra for several DBPs. In the presence of S9, all nine HNMs, but only three HMs, dibromomethane (DBM), dichloromethane (DCM), and bromochloromethane (BCM), were mutagenic. Only two DBPs of each class were mutagenic in the absence of S9. The HNMs were generally more potent mutagens than their HM homologues, and the brominated forms of both classes of DBPs were more mutagenic and cytotoxic than their chlorinated homologues. The HNMs were at least 10 times more cytotoxic than the HMs, and the cytotoxicity rankings in the presence of S9 were similar for the HNMs and the HMs. The addition of a nitro-group to BCM did not change the mutation spectra significantly, with both homologues inducing primarily (55-58%) GC --> AT transitions. The greater cytotoxic and mutagenic activities of the HNMs relative to the HMs are likely due to the greater intrinsic reactivity conferred by the nitro-group. Energy calculations predicted increased reactivity with increasing bromination and greater reactivity of the HNMs versus the HMs (Elumo values were approximately 20 kcal/mol lower for the HNMs compared to their HM homologues). Given that the HNMs also are potent genotoxins in mammalian cells [Environ. Sci. Technol. 38 (2004) 62] and are more mutagenic and 10x more cytotoxic in Salmonella than the HMs, whose levels are regulated in drinking water, further study of their occurrence and potential health effects is warranted.",Is DBM mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
311,"Dibenzoylmethane (DBM), a structural analogue of curcumin (a bioactive phytochemical present in a widely used spice turmeric) was screened for its inhibitory effect against seven cooked food mutagens (heterocyclic amines): 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1), in both TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium using Ames Salmonella/reversion assay in the presence of Aroclor1254-induced rat liver S9 homogenate. DBM has been reported to antagonize the mutagenicity of several chemical carcinogens in vitro and has recently been shown to be even more effective than curcumin in suppressing the 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumors in rats. But there are no reports regarding its antimutagenic properties against cooked food mutagens. Results of the present investigations clearly indicate that dibenzoylmethane is a very potent antimutagenic agent, that could effectively inhibit mutagenicity induced by all the tested cooked food mutagens in both the frame shift (TA98) as well as the base pair mutation sensitive (TA100) strains of S. typhimurium. These highly potent inhibitory effects of dibenzoylmethane against heterocyclic amines observed in our preliminary investigations strongly warrant further studies of its efficacy as a cancer chemopreventive agent.",Is DBM mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
312,"Guanazole and aphidicolin were chosen as candidates in the search for a selective, non-genotoxic inhibitor of DNA replication which could be used instead of hydroxyurea to measure DNA repair synthesis in rat hepatocyte primary cultures by liquid scintillation counting. The genotoxicity of these 3 chemicals was studied using the Salmonella/liver homogenate assay and the autoradiographic UDS test in hepatocytes. Hydroxyurea was positive in both of these assays. Guanazole and aphidicolin did not induce DNA repair in hepatocytes. Aphidicolin was not mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium, whereas guanazole increased the revertant numbers of strain TA102 slightly. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine was measured by liquid scintillation to determine DNA repair induced by 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF), aflatoxin B1, benzo[a]pyrene, cyclophosphamide, H2O2, 6-hydroxydopamine, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), methylnitrosourea (MNU), 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide and UV irradiation in the presence of either 10 mM hydroxyurea, 15 mM guanazole or 0.015 mM aphidicolin. Aphidicolin had an inhibitory effect on DNA repair. Except for the 3 chemicals mentioned below, the sensitivity of the DNA repair measurement was the same, no matter whether hydroxyurea or guanazole was used to inhibit replicative DNA synthesis. In the presence of hydroxyurea, DNA repair synthesis was found at lower concentrations in the case of aflatoxin B1, due to differences in the solvent control values, and in the case of H2O2, possibly due to a synergistic effect between hydroxyurea and H2O2. Guanazole allowed the detection of DNA repair induced by MNNG at lower concentrations, probably because of an antagonistic effect between hydroxyurea and MNNG. Based on these results, it was concluded that guanazole, but not aphidicolin, could be used instead of hydroxyurea to measure DNA repair synthesis by liquid scintillation in rat hepatocyte primary cultures. Although guanazole does not completely fulfill the criteria for an ideal DNA replication inhibitor, it has the advantage of being less genotoxic than hydroxyurea, and also appears to have a smaller potential to falsify the results by interacting with the test compounds.",Is Hydroxyurea mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True
313,"A monitoring of the urinary mutagenicity in workers occupationally exposed to low doses of 2,4,7-trinitro-9-fluorenone (TNF) was undertaken. Urine concentrate of 22 exposed workers (11 smokers and 11 nonsmokers) and 18 presumedly unexposed workers (7 smokers and 11 nonsmokers) were assayed for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 with the plate incorporation technique. In this test system none of the urine concentrate was effective as a mutagen, either in the absence or presence of S9. Fifteen urine samples (8 from exposed workers, 7 from referents) were also tested in the microtiter fluctuation assay. With this technique smoking habits were significantly related to urinary mutagenicity in tests performed with metabolic activation. In neither case however was the association between presumed exposure and urinary mutagenicity significant. These results were evaluated on the basis of urinary mutagenicity data obtained from rats exposed to TNF by different routes. It was shown that the observed urinary mutagenicity accounts for a minor fraction of the administered TNF dose (about 0.1 to 0.2%, depending on the route of exposure); thus it is possible that low-level exposure to TNF could escape detection by urinary mutagenicity monitoring.","Is 2,4,7-trinitro-9-fluorenone mutagenic for TA98 strain?",True
314,"A simple on-site Salmonella mutagenicity test system for the detection of airborne mutagens in the workplace is being developed. The system permits entrapment of mutagenic airborne particles and vapors by impinging unfiltered ambient air into trapping medium containing bacterial tester cells. The trapping device consists mainly of a pump, an impinger and a cyclone. The impinging air flow generated by the pump is approximately 3 1/min. New Salmonella typhimurium testers which are resistant to streptomycin (Str) and 8-azaguanine (AG) were derived from the Ames testers TA98 and TA100 and the arabinose-resistant tester SV50, and were used as mutation indicators. Microbial contamination was sufficiently controlled by addition of ampicillin, Str, AG, and cycloheximide to the trapping and plating media. New tester strains retained a high mutagenic sensitivity from their parent strains. Laboratory studies with volatile mutagens (methyl methanesulfonate, ethyl methanesulfonate, and dimethylnitrosamine) showed that the vapor trapping of this system is promising. The study with suspended silica particles coated with a known mutagen (2,4,7-trinitro-9-fluorenone) indicated that the particle trapping of the system is satisfactory. Incorporation of metabolic activation into the trapping medium by confining S9 mix and tester cells in dialysis tubing enabled this system to detect promutagens. This in situ system may be useful for mutagenic monitoring in the workplace.","Is 2,4,7-trinitro-9-fluorenone mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?",True
315,"The mutagenicity of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene and its S-conjugates 1-(glutathion-S-yl)-1,2,3,4,4-pentachloro-1,3-butadiene (GTB), 1,4-(bis-glutathion-S-yl-1,2,3,4-tetrachloro-1,3-butadiene (BGTB) and 1,4-(bis-cystein-S-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrachloro-1,3-butadiene (BCTB) was investigated in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 using a modified preincubation assay. GTB was a direct-acting mutagen; the mutagenic potency of GTB was markedly enhanced by rat kidney microsomes or mitochondria and less so by cytosol. The bis-conjugates BGTB and BCTB were not mutagenic in the strains TA100, TA2638 and TA98. Purified HCBD was not mutagenic either without exogenous metabolic activation or with rat liver microsomes fortified with NADPH. Preincubation with rat liver microsomes and glutathione resulted in an unequivocal mutagenic activity of HCBD which was increased by additional inclusion of rat kidney microsomes. The cysteine conjugate beta-lyase inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid decreased the mutagenicity of HCBD and its S-conjugates. These results provide strong evidence that formation of the corresponding monoglutathione S-conjugate from HCBD and subsequent cleavage of this conjugate by gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and beta-lyase may be responsible for the nephrocarcinogenicity of the parent compound in vivo, whereas formation of the bis-glutathione S-conjugate probably plays no role in the organ specific effects of HCBD.",Is HCBD mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
316,"The metabolism of beta-lyase and the mutagenicity of the synthetic cysteine conjugates S-1,2-dichlorovinylcysteine (DCVC), S-1,2,2-trichlorovinylcysteine (TCVC), S-1,2,3,4,4-pentachlorobuta-1,3-dienylcysteine (PCBC) and S-3-chloropropenylcysteine (CPC) were investigated in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA2638 and TA98. The bacteria contained significantly higher concentrations of beta-lyase than mammalian subcellular fractions. Bacterial 100,000 X g supernatants cleaved benzthiazolylcysteine to equimolar amounts of mercaptobenzthiazole and pyruvate. DCVC, TCVC and PCBC produced a linear time-dependent increase in pyruvate formation when incubated with bacterial 100,000 X g supernatants; pyruvate formation was inhibited by the beta-lyase inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA). CPC was not cleaved by bacterial enzymes to pyruvate. DCVC, TCVC and PCBC were mutagenic in three strains of S. typhimurium (TA100, TA2638 and TA98) in the Ames-test without addition of mammalian subcellular fractions; their mutagenicity was decreased by the addition of AOAA to the preincubation mixture. CPC was not mutagenic in any of the strains of bacteria tested. These results indicate that beta-lyase plays a key role in the metabolism and mutagenicity of haloalkenylcysteines when tested in S. typhimurium systems. The demonstrated formation in mammals of the mutagens DCVC, TCVC and PCBC during biotransformation of trichloroethylene (Tri), tetrachloroethylene (Tetra) and hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD) may provide a molecular explanation for the nephrocarcinogenicity of these compounds.",Is CPC mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
317,"The in vitro antimutagenic and DNA protecting potential of organic (methanol, hexane, n-butanol) and aqueous extract/fractions of Parkinsonia aculeata L. (Fabaceae) was investigated by employing Ames assay and DNA nicking assay. DNA damage by hydroxyl radicals was effectively inhibited by all the extract/fractions. A marked antimutagenic effect was observed against 4-Nitro-o-phenylenediamine and sodium azide (direct acting mutagens) and 2-Aminofluorene (indirect acting mutagen) in TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium. In Ames assay, two different modes of experiments i.e. pre-incubation and co-incubation were performed and it was observed that all the extract/fractions showed better results in the pre-incubation as compared to co- incubation mode. Out of all the extract/fractions tested, n-butanol fraction was found to be the most effective in preventing DNA damage and inhibiting mutagenesis. UHPLC analysis of extract/fractions revealed presence of polyphenols such as gallic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, umbelliferone, coumaric acid, rutin, and ellagic acid etc. DNA protecting and antimutagenic activity of this plant could be attributed to presence of these polyphenols. The results of this study indicate the presence of potent antioxidant factors in Parkinsonia aculeata L, which are being explored further for their mechanism of action.

318,"The food mutagen 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) is an analogue of quinoline, a hepatocarcinogen. 2-Aminofluorene, benzidine and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) are potent inducers of unscheduled DNA repair in primary culture rat liver hepatocytes, as was IQ (151 grains/nucleus at 1 X 10(-6) M). Quinoline, on the other hand, is only weakly positive in this assay (15 grains/nucleus at 1 X 10(-3) M). IQ, quinoline and DMAB were applied topically to shaved skin of Sencar mice with promotion by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) for 20 weeks, when 14 of 20 mice in the quinoline group had 25 tumors, but only one of 30 animals in the IQ group and five of 30 in the DMAB group were tumor-bearing. Analogs of IQ synthesized by substitution at the 2- or 3-position with amino or methyl groups were assayed with the Ames Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98 and TA100. Mutagenicity for TA98 is reduced in the absence of the 3-methyl group and is completely abolished with removal of the 2-amino moiety. None of these analogs are strong mutagens for TA100. Exocyclic N-oxidation is a likely obligatory step in the activation of IQ to a mutagen.",Is IQ mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
319,"Because both oxidative and reductive metabolism of the hepatocarcinogen 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) can occur in vivo, we have examined the mutagenicity of compounds which can be formed from 2,4-DNT in an attempt to establish which metabolic pathways contribute to the formation of genotoxic products. A quantitative reversion assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was used to evaluate the mutagenicity of these compounds. 2,4-Dinitrobenzyl alcohol, 2-amino-4-nitrotoluene and 2-nitroso-4-nitrotoluene were found to be more mutagenic to S. typhimurium than is 2,4-DNT and did not require metabolic activation by post-mitochondrial supernatants of Aroclor-induced rat liver homogenates (S9) for their effect. 2-Amino-4-nitrobenzoic acid was also mutagenic to S. typhimurium TA98 in the absence of S9, but its mutagenicity was enhanced when S9 was included in the incubation mixture. 2,4-Diaminotoluene required S9 for demonstration of mutagenicity and was approximately as effective, on a molar basis, as 2,4-DNT in inducing reversion to histidine prototrophy.

None of the compounds was mutagenic without norharman. In the presence of norharman, however, nitrobenzene, nitrotoluene, nitroanisole, nitrochlorobenzene and nitrobenzaldehyde exhibited mutagenicity only to S. typhimurium TA98 with S9 mix.

321,"2-Nitroanisole (2-NA) is used in the manufacturing of azo dyes and causes cancer, mainly in the urinary bladder. Previous in vivo genotoxic data seems to be insufficient to explain the mechanism through which 2-NA induces carcinogenesis, and several bladder carcinogens were reported to induce oxidative DNA damage. Thus, we examined the potential induction of oxidative DNA damage by 2-NA using bacterial strain YG3008, a mutM ST -deficient derivative of strain TA100. Consequently, strain YG3008, when compared with strain TA100, was found to be more sensitive to 2-NA, indicating oxidative DNA damage in bacterial cells. For further investigation, we performed the comet assay using the urinary bladder and liver of rats, with and without human 8-oxoguanine DNA-glycosylase 1 (hOGG1), to confirm the potential of 2-NA for inducing oxidative DNA damage. Simultaneously, we conducted a micronucleus test using bone marrow from rats to assess the genotoxicity of 2-NA in vivo. 2-NA was administered orally to male Fischer 344 rats for 3 consecutive days. The rats were divided into 6 treatment groups: 3 groups treated with 2-NA at doses of 125, 250, and 500mg/kg; a group treated with the combination of 2-NA and glutathione-SH (GSH); a negative control group; and a positive control group. The comet assay without hOGG1 detected no DNA damage in the liver or urinary bladder, and the micronucleus test did not show clastogenic effects in bone marrow cells. However, the comet assay with hOGG1 was positive in the urinary bladder samples, indicating the induction of oxidative DNA damage in the urinary bladder for the group treated with 2-NA at 500mg/kg. Moreover, an antioxidant of GSH significantly reduced oxidative DNA damage caused by 2-NA. These results indicate that oxidative DNA damage is a possible mode of action for carcinogenesis in the urinary bladder of rats treated with 2-NA.",Is 2-NA mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
322,"o-Nitroanisole is used as an intermediate for the preparation of o-anisidine and in the manufacture of azo dyes. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering o-nitroanisole (>99% pure) in the diet to groups of male and female F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice for 14 days, 13 weeks, and 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and mouse lymphoma cells. 14-DAY STUDIES: Groups of five male and five female F344 rats received diets containing 0, 583, 1,166, 2,332, 4,665, or 9,330 ppm o-nitroanisole. Mean body weight gains and final mean body weights of males in the 4,665 and 9,330 ppm groups were lower than those of the controls. Absolute liver weights were significantly increased in males receiving 1,166 ppm or more and in females receiving 583 ppm or more. Groups of five male and five female B6C3F1 mice received diets containing 0, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. Mean body weight gains and final mean body weights of males that received 250 ppm and females that received 4,000 ppm were significantly lower than those of the controls. No other chemical-associated effects were observed. 13-WEEK STUDIES: Groups of 10 male and 10 female F344 rats received diets containing 0, 200, 600, 2,000, 6,000, or 18,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. Final mean body weights and feed consumption by male and female rats receiving 6,000 and 18,000 ppm were lower than those of the controls. Hemoglobin and hematocrit values were significantly lower and methemoglobin levels significantly higher in males in the 6,000 and 18,000 ppm groups than in controls. Absolute liver weights were significantly increased in females that received 200, 600, 2,000, and 6,000 ppm, absolute kidney weights were significantly increased in males that received 600, 2,000, and 6,000 ppm, and absolute spleen weights were significantly increased in males and females that received 6,000 and 18,000 ppm. Groups of 10 male and 10 female B6C3F1 mice received diets containing 0, 60, 200, 600, 2,000, or 6,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. Final mean body weight gains, final mean body weights, and feed consumption by male and female mice receiving 6,000 ppm were lower than those of the controls. Hemoglobin and hematocrit values in males and females that received 2,000 or 6,000 ppm were significantly lower than those in the controls. The absolute and relative liver weights of females in the 600 ppm group and relative liver weights of males and females in the 2,000 and 6,000 ppm groups were significantly greater than those of controls. Lesions associated with exposure to o-nitroanisole were present in the urinary bladder, spleen, kidney, liver, testis, and uterus of rats. Diffuse hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder occurred in all male and female rats that received 6,000 and 18,000 ppm. A transitional cell papilloma occurred in one male and transitional cell carcinomas occurred in two males and three females receiving 18,000 ppm. Congestion of the red pulp and capsular hyperplasia of the spleen and hepatocellular hypertrophy of the liver were present in males and females from the 18,000 ppm groups. Multifocal degeneration and necrosis of the renal tubule epithelium with infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells were present in male rats that received 600, 2,000, and 6,000 ppm. At the 18,000 ppm level, degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium accompanied by loss of spermatogenic cells and decreased numbers of spermatozoa were observed in the testes of male rats, while uterine atrophy was observed in female rats. Hepatocyte hypertrophy of the centrilobular and midzonal regions of liver lobules was present in mice that received 200 ppm and increased in severity at higher exposure levels. 2-YEAR STUDIES: The doses selected for the 2-year study of o-nitroanisole in rats were based on lower mean body weights, reduced feed consumption, and increased severity of regenerative anemia in male and female rats receiving 6,000 and 18,000 ppm during the 13-week study. Groups of 6roups of 60 male and 60 female F344 rats received diets containing 0, 222, 666, or 2,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. Groups of 60 male and 60 female B6C3F1 mice received diets containing 0, 666, 2,000, or 6,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. After 15 months, up to 10 animals from each group were evaluated for chemical-related lesions. Survival, Body Weights, Feed Consumption, and Clinical Findings: Survival of male rats receiving 2,000 ppm was significantly lower than that of the controls due to increased severity of nephropathy. Survival of 222 and 666 ppm male rats and all exposed female rats was similar to that of the controls. Survival of groups of exposed male and female mice was similar to that of the controls. The final mean body weight of male rats receiving 2,000 ppm was lower than that of the controls. Final mean body weights of male and female mice that received 2,000 and 6,000 ppm were lower than those of the controls. Feed consumption by male and female rats was similar to that by the controls. The only clinical finding in male or female mice attributable to chemical administration was discolored urine. Neoplasms and Nonneoplastic Lesions: The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia was significantly increased in male rats that received 666 and 2,000 ppm and in female rats that received 2,000 ppm (males: 0 ppm, 26/50; 222 ppm, 25/50; 666 ppm, 42/50; 2,000 ppm, 34/50; females: 14/50, 11/50, 14/50, 26/50). Nephropathy occurred in all male rats; the severity increased with exposure level. Focal hyperplasia of the renal tubule epithelium was present in three males receiving 222 ppm and two males receiving 2,000 ppm. Renal tubule adenomas occurred in one male from each of the 222, 666, and 2,000 ppm groups, and renal tubule carcinomas occurred in two males from the 2,000 ppm group. Focal hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder was present in one female rat that received 222 ppm and two male rats and six female rats that received 2,000 ppm. A transitional cell papilloma occurred in the urinary bladder of one female rat from the 2,000 ppm group, and a transitional cell carcinoma occurred in another female from the 2,000 ppm group. The incidence of forestomach ulcers increased in male rats that received 2,000 ppm, and the incidence of focal hyperplasia of the forestomach increased with exposure level in male and female rats. In addition, squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach were present in one female receiving 222 ppm, one male receiving 666 ppm, and one male and one female receiving 2,000 ppm, while squamous cell carcinomas were present in one male receiving 666 ppm and one male and one female receiving 2,000 ppm. The incidences of pituitary gland adenomas in male rats and mammary gland fibroadenomas in female rats decreased with exposure level. The incidence of cellular alteration in the liver was significantly increased in exposed groups of male and female mice. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined), and hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma (combined) were significantly increased in male mice receiving 2,000 and 6,000 ppm. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma were significantly increased in female mice that received 2,000 ppm. STOP-EXPOSURE STUDY: Groups of 60 male and 60 female F344 rats received diets containing 0, 6,000, or 18,000 ppm o-nitroanisole for 27 weeks and were then maintained on control feed without further chemical exposure for up to an additional 77 weeks. Up to 10 rats from each group were evaluated for the presence of chemical-related lesions at 3, 6, 9, and 15 months. Survival and Body Weights: Survival of exposed male and female rats was significantly lower than that of the controls as a result of moribund deaths associated with significantly increased incidences of urinary bladder neoplasms, primarily transitional cell carcinomas. All male rats that received 18,000 ppm were dead by week 48 and all females that received 18,000 ppm were dead by week 61. Mean body weights of exposed male and female rats were lower than those of the controls throughout the study. Neoplasms and Nonneoplastic Lesions: Hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder was present in nearly all exposed male and female rats examined at the interim evaluations. A transitional cell carcinoma was first observed at the 3-month interim evaluation in a male rat that received 18,000 ppm. At the 6- and 9-month interim evaluations, transitional cell papillomas or carcinomas were observed in both exposed groups of male rats. Transitional cell carcinomas were observed at the 6-month interim evaluation in females receiving 18,000 ppm and at the 9-month interim evaluation in females receiving 6,000 and 18,000 ppm. Adenomatous polyps of the large intestine were observed in a small number of exposed rats at the 6-, 9-, and 15-month interim evaluations. At the end of the study, the incidence of adenomatous polyps of the large intestine was significantly increased in all exposed groups and carcinomas of the large intestine were present in four males and two females from the 18,000 ppm groups. The incidence of hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium of the kidney pelvis was significantly increased in exposed male and female rats and transitional cell papillomas were present in three males and one female that received 18,000 ppm. Transitional cell carcinomas of the kidney were present in one male receiving 6,000 ppm and six males and one female receiving 18,000 ppm. Transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder were seen in nearly all exposed male and female rats. Of the males and females receiving 6,000 ppm which were without carcinomas, three males and one female had transitional cell papillomas. Generalized centrilobular hypertrophy, focal hepatocellular necrosis, multifocal hepatocellular cytoplasmic vacuolation, and Kupffer cell pigmentation were observed in the livers of male and female rats at the 3- and 6-month interim evaluations; however, only Kupffer cell pigmentation was observed at the end of the study. Congestion of the red pulp of the spleen was observed in nearly all exposed male and female rats at the 3-, 6-, and 9-month interim evaluations but the incidence was only slightly increased in the 18,000 ppm groups at the end of the study. Degeneration and atrophy of the seminiferous tubule epithelium of the testes were observed at the 3- and 6-month interim evaluations in all male rats receiving 18,000 ppm. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: o-Nitroanisole was tested in two laboratories for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 with and without exogenous metabolic activation (S9). Positive responses were observed at both laboratories in TA100 with and without S9 activation. One laboratory found no increase in mutations, while the second laboratory detected a weakly positive response in TA1535 without S9. No mutagenic activity was observed in the other tester strains. o-Nitroanisole was positive in the mouse lymphoma assay for induction of trifluorothymidine resistance in L5178Y cells without S9 activation. In cytogenetic tests with Chinese hamster ovary cells, o-nitroanisole induced a significant increase in chromosomal aberrations at the highest dose tested in the presence of S9 activation; sister chromatid exchanges were induced both with and without S9. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these feed studies there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole in male and female F344 rats that received diets containing 6,000 or 18,000 ppm for 6 months based on overall increased incidences of benign and malignant neoplasms of the urinary bladder, transitional cell neoplasms of the kidney, and benign and malignant neoplasms of the large intestine. There was a chemical-related increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats receiving diets containing 222, 666, or 2,000 ppm o-nitroanisole for 2 years. Marginally increased incidences of uncommon renal tubule neoplasms in male rats and forestomach neoplasms in male and female rats were considered uncertain findings. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of benign and malignant hepatocellular neoplasms. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas. Increased severity of nephropathy in male rats, and increased incidences of focal hyperplasia of the renal tubule epithelium and forestomach ulcers in male rats, and of transitional cell hyperplasia of the urinary bladder, focal hyperplasia of the forestomach, and hyperplasia of transitional epithelium of the kidney pelvis in male and female rats were associated with exposure to o-nitroanisole.

323,"Capsicum-derived ingredients function as skin-conditioning agents--miscellaneous, external analgesics, flavoring agents, or fragrance components in cosmetics. These ingredients are used in 19 cosmetic products at concentrations as high as 5%. Cosmetic-grade material may be extracted using hexane, ethanol, or vegetable oil and contain the full range of phytocompounds that are found in the Capsicum annuum or Capsicum frutescens plant (aka red chiles), including Capsaicin. Aflatoxin and N-nitroso compounds (N-nitrosodimethylamine and N-nitrosopyrrolidine) have been detected as contaminants. The ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectrum for Capsicum Annuum Fruit Extract indicates a small peak at approximately 275 nm, and a gradual increase in absorbance, beginning at approximately 400 nm. Capsicum and paprika are generally recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in food. Hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate extracts of Capsicum Frutescens Fruit at 200 mg/kg resulted in death of all mice. In a short-term inhalation toxicity study using rats, no difference was found between vehicle control and a 7% Capsicum Oleoresin solution. In a 4-week feeding study, red chilli (Capsicum annuum) in the diet at concentrations up to 10% was relatively nontoxic in groups of male mice. In an 8-week feeding study using rats, intestinal exfoliation, cytoplasmic fatty vacuolation and centrilobular necrosis of hepatocytes, and aggregation of lymphocytes in the portal areas were seen at 10% Capsicum Frutescens Fruit, but not 2%. Rats fed 0.5 g/kg day-1 crude Capsicum Fruit Extract for 60 days exhibited no significant gross pathology at necropsy, but slight hyperemia of the liver and reddening of the gastric mucosa were observed. Weanling rats fed basal diets supplemented with whole red pepper at concentrations up to 5.0% for up to 8 weeks had no pathology of the large intestines, livers, and kidneys, but destruction of the taste buds and keratinization and erosion of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract were noted in groups fed 0.5% to 5.0% red pepper. The results of 9-and 12-month extension of this study showed normal large intestines and kidneys. In rabbits fed Capsicum Annuum Powder at 5 mg/kg day-1 in the diet daily for 12 months damage to the liver and spleen was noted. A rabbit skin irritation test of Capsicum Annuum Fruit Extract at concentrations ranging from 0.1% to 1.0% produced no irritation, but Capsicum Frutescens Fruit Extract induced concentration-dependent (at 25 to 500 microg/ml) cytotoxicity in a human buccal mucosa fibroblast cell line. An ethanol extract of red chili was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA98, but not in TA100, or in Escherichia coli. Other genotoxicity assays gave a similar pattern of mixed results. Adenocarcinoma of the abdomen was observed in 7/20 mice fed 100 mg red chilies per day for 12 months; no tumors were seen in control animals. Neoplastic changes in the liver and intestinal tumors were observed in rats fed red chili powder at 80 mg/kg day-1 for 30 days, intestinal and colon tumors were seen in rats fed red chili powder and 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine, but no tumors were observed in controls. In another study in rats, however, red chile pepper in the diet at the same dose decreased the number of tumors seen with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine. Other feeding studies evaluated the effect of red chili peppers on the incidence of stomach tumors produced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, finding that red pepper had a promoting effect. Capsicum Frutescens Fruit Extract promoted the carcinogenic effect of methyl(acetoxymethyl)nitrosamine (carcinogen) or benzene hexachloride (hepatocarcinogen) in inbred male and female Balb/c mice dosed orally (tongue application). Clinical findings include symptoms of cough, sneezing, and runny nose in chili factory workers. Human respiratory responses to Capsicum Oleoresin spray include burning of the throat, wheezing, dry cough, shortness of breath, gagging, gasping, inability to breathe or speak, and, rarely, cyanosis, apnea, and respiratory arrest. A trade name mixture containing 1% to 5% Capsicum Frutescens Fruit Extract induced very slight erythema in 1 of 10 volunteers patch tested for 48 h. Capsicum Frutescens Fruit Extract at 0.025% in a repeated-insult patch test using 103 subjects resulted in no clinically meaningful irritation or allergic contact dermatitis. One epidemiological study indicated that chili pepper consumption may be a strong risk factor for gastric cancer in populations with high intakes of chili pepper; however, other studies did not find this association. Capsaicin functions as an external analgesic, a fragrance ingredient, and as a skin-conditioning agent--miscellaneous in cosmetic products, but is not in current use. Capsaicin is not generally recognized as safe and effective by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for fever blister and cold sore treatment, but is considered to be safe and effective as an external analgesic counterirritant. Ingested Capsaicin is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine in animal studies. Subcutaneous injection of Capsaicin in rats resulted in a rise in the blood concentration, reaching a maximum at 5 h; the highest tissue concentrations were in the kidney and lowest in the liver. In vitro percutaneous absorption of Capsaicin has been demonstrated in human, rat, mouse, rabbit, and pig skin. Enhancement of the skin permeation of naproxen (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent) in the presence of Capsaicin has also been demonstrated. Pharmacological and physiological studies demonstrated that Capsaicin, which contains a vanillyl moiety, produces its sensory effects by activating a Ca2 +-permeable ion channel on sensory neurons. Capsaicin is a known activator of vanilloid receptor 1. Capsaicin-induced stimulation of prostaglandin biosynthesis has been shown using bull seminal vesicles and rheumatoid arthritis synoviocytes. Capsaicin inhibits protein synthesis in Vero kidney cells and human neuroblastoma SHSY-5Y cells in vitro, and inhibits growth of E. coli, Pseudomonas solanacearum, and Bacillus subtilis bacterial cultures, but not Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Oral LD50 values as low as 161.2 mg/kg (rats) and 118.8 mg/kg (mice) have been reported for Capsaicin in acute oral toxicity studies, with hemorrhage of the gastric fundus observed in some of the animals that died. Intravenous, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous LD50 values were lower. In subchronic oral toxicity studies using mice, Capsaicin produced statistically significant differences in the growth rate and liver/body weight increases. Capsaicin is an ocular irritant in mice, rats, and rabbits. Dose-related edema was observed in animals receiving Capsaicin injections into the hindpaw (rats) or application to the ear (mice). In guinea pigs, dinitrochlorobenzene contact dermatitis was enhanced in the presence of Capsaicin, injected subcutaneously, whereas dermal application inhibited sensitization in mice. Immune system effects have been observed in neonatal rats injected subcutaneously with Capsaicin. Capsaicin produced mixed results in S. typhimurium micronucleus and sister-chromatid exchange genotoxicity assays. Positive results for Capsaicin were reported in DNA damage assays. Carcinogenic, cocarcinogenic, anticarcinogenic, antitumorigenic, tumor promotion, and anti-tumor promotion effects of Capsaicin have been reported in animal studies. Except for a significant reduction in crown-rump length in day 18 rats injected subcutaneously with Capsaicin (50 mg/kg) on gestation days 14, 16, 18, or 20, no reproductive or developmental toxicity was noted. In pregnant mice dosed subcutaneously with Capsaicin, depletion of substance P in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves of pregnant females and fetuses was noted. In clinical tests, nerve degeneration of intracutaneous nerve fibers and a decrease in pain sensation induced by heat and mechanical stimuli were evident in subjects injected intradermally with Capsaicin. An increase in mean inspiratory flow was reported for eight normal subjects who inhaled nebulized 10(-7) M Capsaicin. The results of provocative and predictive tests involving human subjects indicated that Capsaicin is a skin irritant. Overall, studies suggested that these ingredients can be irritating at low concentrations. Although the genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and tumor promotion potential of Capsaicin have been demonstrated, so have opposite effects. Skin irritation and other tumor-promoting effects of Capsaicin appear to be mediated through interaction with the same vanilloid receptor. Given this mechanism of action and the observation that many tumor promoters are irritating to the skin, the Panel considered it likely that a potent tumor promoter may also be a moderate to severe skin irritant. Thus, a limitation on Capsaicin content that would significantly reduce its skin irritation potential is expected to, in effect, lessen any concerns relating to tumor promotion potential. Because Capsaicin enhanced the penetration of an anti-inflammatory agent through human skin, the Panel recommends that care should be exercised in using ingredients that contain Capsaicin in cosmetic products. The Panel advised industry that the total polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)/pesticide contamination should be limited to not more than 40 ppm, with not more than 10 ppm for any specific residue, and agreed on the following limitations for other impurities: arsenic (3 mg/kg max), heavy metals (0.002% max), and lead (5 mg/kg max). Industry was also advised that aflatoxin should not be present in these ingredients (the Panel adopted < or =15 ppb as corresponding to ""negative"" aflatoxin content), and that ingredients derived from Capsicum annuum and Capsicum Frutescens Plant species should not be used in products where N-nitroso compounds may be formed.

324,"Among the various kinds of spices tested, the aqueous extracts of dill weed from Anethum graveolens L. and dill seeds from A. sowa D.C. (Umbelliferae), exhibited a mutagenicity to Salmonella typhimurium, strains TA98 and TA100. The aqueous methanol extracts were fractionated by the mutation assay using the strain TA98 with S-9 Mix. Isorhamnetin 3-sulfate (persicarin) and quercetin 3-sulfate were characterized as the mutagenic principles. Carcinogenicity was not observed for dill weed and seeds when the diets containing these in 33% were administered for 450 and 410 days, respectively, to the inbred strain ACI rats.",Is dill seeds mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
325,"1,3-Dithiane and 1,4-dithiane are the sulfur-containing Maillard reaction products (MRPs) which have been found in boiled beef extracts. In this study the genotoxicity of these products was examined using the Salmonella/microsomal test and the CHO/SCE assay. 1,3-Dithiane showed a potent direct-acting mutagenicity toward S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100, but 1,4-dithiane had a lower mutagenicity toward both tester strains. Both compounds were shown to be non-mutagenic with hepatic metabolic activation with the exception of 1,3-dithiane toward strain TA100. To compare the mutagenic potential of 1,3-dithiane and 1,4-dithiane with other types of MRPs, 24 MRPs were examined for their mutagenicity to S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100 in the presence or absence of S9 mix. 2,6-Dimethylpyrazine, furan, 2-acetylpyrrole, and thiazole were shown to be mutagenic. However, these four MRPs exhibited a lower mutagenicity in TA98 than 1,3-dithiane and 1,4-dithiane. Furthermore, SCE frequencies in CHO cells were very significantly induced by 1,3-dithiane in the absence of S9 mix, but the SCE-inducing capability of 1,3-dithiane was reduced or even disappeared with metabolic activation. 1,4-Dithiane did not significantly induce SCE frequencies in the presence or absence of S9 mix. Thus, we concluded that 1,3-dithiane was a potent mutagenic MRP in the Salmonella/microsomal test, whereas it was a weak SCE inducer in the CHO/SCE assay.","Is 1,4-Dithiane mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?",True
326,"Diethylstilbestrol was tested for mutagenicity with his- S. typhimurium strains under 10 different matabolic situations (no exogenous metabolizing system; S9 mix from liver homogenate of rats induced with Aroclor 1254, with or without inhibition of epoxide hydratase; liver and/or kidney S9 mix from control or hamsters treated with Aroclor 1254; horse-radish peroxidase + H2O2). Under none of these conditions did diethylstilbestrol give any indication of a mutagenic effect. Furthermore, 11 metabolites and other derivatives of diethylstilbestrol, 2 of them potent inducers of sister-chromatid exchange in cultured fibroblasts, were not mutagenic with any of the 4 tester strains (S. typhimurium TA100, TA98, TA1537, TA1535) in the presence or absence of S9 mix from liver homogenate of rats induced with Aroclor 1254. Thus, one of the few known human carcinogens is very resistant to detection by the mammalian enzyme-mediated Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity test (Ames test). This is especially remarkable since the metabolizing systems used included: (1) some of very high metabolic activity (S9 mix from liver homogenate of rats and hamsters induced with Aroclor 1254); (2) metabolizing systems from organs susceptible to the carcinogenic activity of diethylstilbestrol (hamster kidney); as well as (3) a mixture of (1) and (2) in case both activities are required for the carcinogenic effect in the whole animal.",Is Diethylstilbestrol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
327,"Destruction procedures for dimethylsulfate (DMS), diethylsulfate (DES), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) have been investigated using treatment by 1 N NaOH, 1 N NH4OH, 1 M Na2CO3, and 1 M Na2S2O3. During the kinetic study of the destruction process, the determination of remaining concentrations of the alkylating agents was performed by the derivatization of p-nitrophenoxide to p-nitroanisole and p-nitrophenetole, which were separated by high performance liquid chromatography. The mutagenic activity of the destruction products was evaluated by the Ames test using Salmonella tester strains TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA102. The kinetics of destruction in every case followed a time-dependent exponential relationship. Solutions of 1 M Na2S2O3 showed the highest capacity for destruction of the four alkylating agents, half-lives of DMS, DES, MMS, and EMS being 0.14 min, 1.26 min, 0.60 min, and 5.26 min, respectively. No mutagenic activity was detected following complete destruction in 1 M Na2S2O3.",Is DES mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
328,"Nitrated derivatives of the aza-arenes carbazole and 2-hydroxycarbazole were synthesized and tested for mutagenicity in the Ames plate-incorporation assay. 3,6-Dinitrocarbazole was the most mutagenic towards Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 (> 100 revertants/micrograms, 25 revertants/nmol, with or without S9) followed by 2-hydroxy-1,3,6-trinitrocarbazole (24 revertants/micrograms, 7 revertants/nmol without S9) and 2-hydroxy-3-nitrocarbazole (27 revertants/micrograms, 6 revertants/nmol without S9). 2-Hydroxy-1,3-dinitrocarbazole, 1,6-dinitrocarbazole, 3-nitrocarbazole and 1-nitrocarbazole ranged from moderately to weakly active (7-1 revertants/micrograms, 2-0.3 revertants/nmol without S9). Carbazole and 2-hydroxycarbazole, and 2-hydroxy-1-nitrocarbazole, were quite inactive. Activity was generally decreased by the presence of S9, except for the dinitrocarbazoles, and was also lower in the variant TA98NR, indicating that mutagenicity was largely dependent on the presence of the 'classical' bacterial nitroreductase. The relative activities of these compounds are consistent with the hypothesis that structural features (orientation of the nitro group relative to the plane and to the long axis of the molecule, and ability to resonance-stabilize the positive charge on the arylnitrenium active electrophile intermediate) are major influences determining mutagenic potency of nitrated compounds.","Is 3,6-Dinitrocarbazole mutagenic for TA98 strain?",True
329,"Ethylenediamine dinitrate (EDDN) and diethylenetriamine trinitrate (DETN) are relatively insensitive explosive compounds that are being explored as safe alternatives to other more sensitive compounds. When used in combination with other high explosives they are an improvement and may provide additional safety during storage and use. The genetic toxicity of these compounds was evaluated to predict the potential adverse human health effects from exposure by using a standard genetic toxicity test battery which included: a gene mutation test in bacteria (Ames), an in vitro Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell chromosome aberration test and an in vivo mouse micronucleus test. The results of the Ames test showed that EDDN increased the mean number of revertants per plate with strain TA100, without activation, at 5000μg/plate compared to the solvent control, which indicated a positive result. No positive results were observed with the other tester strains with or without activation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA1535, TA1537, and Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA. DETN was negative for all Salmonella tester strains and E. coli up to 5000μg/plate both with and without metabolic activation. The CHO cell chromosome aberration assay was performed using EDDN and DETN at concentrations up to 5000μg/mL. The results indicate that these compounds did not induce structural chromosomal aberrations at all tested concentrations in CHO cells, with or without metabolic activation. EDDN and DETN, when tested in vivo in the CD-1 mouse at doses up to 2000mg/kg, did not induce any significant increase in the number of micronuclei in bone marrow erythrocytes. These studies demonstrate that EDDN is mutagenic in one strain of Salmonella (TA100) but was negative in other strains, for in vitro induction of chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells, and for micronuclei in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. DETN was not genotoxic in all in vitro and in vivo tests. These results show the in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity potential of these chemicals.",Is Ethylenediamine dinitrate mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
330,"The Amazonian Croton lechleri stem bark essential oil was tested for its anti-mutagenic potential by performing the Ames test against heterocyclic amines (HCAs), in continuing research on applicative functional profile of this phytocomplex as food ingredient (Rossi et al., 2011). Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 was used with and without metabolic activation (S9 mix). The anti-mutagenic properties was assayed with the following HCAs: 2-amino-3-methylimidazo-[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo-[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo-[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), the imidazoles 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido-[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1) and 2-aminodipirydo-[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-2). All HCAs with S9 induced mutagenicity at 10(-10) mol/plate. Without S9, IQ and MeIQ showed mutagenicity at 10(-8) mol/plate, MeIQx and Glu-P-1 at 10(-5) mol/plate, while Glu-P-2 was inactive. In presence of HACs (10(-9) mol/plate), C. lechleri essential oil was tested for mutagen-protective properties (concentration range: 0.01-0.10 mg/plate) taking the Highest Uneffective Dose (HUD) as threshold reference. With S9 mix, C. lechleri essential oil displayed a significant reduction of revertants at 0.05 mg/plate, from 21% to 34%. The essential oil showed mutagen-protective efficacy against IQ and MeIQ tested as direct mutagens (10(-7) mol/plate), with a revertants percentage reduction of 39% and 40%, respectively. No anti-mutagen capacity was noted for MeIQx and Glu-P-1 (10(-5) mol/plate). Since HACs are known as possible colon and liver cancer inducers, C. lechleri essential oil was tested for its cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative capacity against LoVo and HepG2 cancer cell lines showing IC50 of 74.95±0.05 μg/ml (LoVo) and 82.28±0.03 μg/ml (HepG2), displaying a promising role of this essential oil as a functional food ingredient with interesting mutagen preventing properties.",Is Glu-P-1 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

332,"Sulforaphane, a constituent of broccoli was investigated for its antimutagenic potential against different classes of cooked food mutagens (heterocyclic amines). These include imidazoazaarenes such as 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP); pyridoindole derivatives such as 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2); and, dipyridoimidazole derivative such as 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1). Tests were carried out by Ames Salmonella/reversion assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 (frame shift mutation sensitive) and TA100 (base pair mutation sensitive) bacterial strains in the presence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver S9. Results of these in vitro antimutagenicity studies strongly suggest that sulforaphane is a potent inhibitor of the mutagenicity induced by imidazoazaarenes such as IQ, MeIQ and MeIQx (approximately 60% inhibition) and moderately active against pyridoindole derivatives such as Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 (32-48% inhibition), but ineffective against dipyridoimidazole derivative (Glu-P-1) in TA 100.",Is Glu-P-1 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
333,"Anti-mutagenic and anti-carcinogenic effects of beer on heterocyclic amine (HCA)-induced carcinogenesis were studied in vitro and in vivo. Four commercial beers (two pilsner-type, black, and stout) showed inhibitory effects against five HCAs, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1) and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]-quinoline (IQ), in the Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of rat S9 mix. The inhibitory effects of dark-colored beers (stout and black beer) were greater than those of pilsner-type beers. Dark-colored beers suppressed CYP1A2 activity in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that inhibition of HCA activation is partly responsible for their strong anti-mutagenic effects. Anti-mutagenic effects were also observed when the pooled human S9 mix or activated IQ was used in the assay. The micronucleus test using Chinese hamster lung CHL/IU cells showed that the addition of freeze-dried samples of pilsner-type and stout beer to the culture medium significantly reduced the number of cells with micronuclei induced with PhIP or Trp-P-2. Single-cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay) revealed that oral ingestion of pilsner-type and stout beers for 1 week significantly inhibited DNA damage in the liver cells of male ICR mice exposed to MeIQx (13 mg/kg, i.p.). A decrease in the formation of DNA adducts was also observed using a 32P-postlabeling method. Male Fischer 344 rats orally received PhIP (75 mg/kg, five times a week for 2 weeks) and aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation in the colon was analyzed after 5 weeks. The number of ACF was significantly reduced in rats fed a diet containing freeze-dried beer. These results suggest that beer inhibits the genotoxic effects of HCAs and may reduce the risk of carcinogenesis caused by food borne carcinogens.",Is Glu-P-1 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
334,"Dibenzoylmethane (DBM), a structural analogue of curcumin (a bioactive phytochemical present in a widely used spice turmeric) was screened for its inhibitory effect against seven cooked food mutagens (heterocyclic amines): 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1), in both TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium using Ames Salmonella/reversion assay in the presence of Aroclor1254-induced rat liver S9 homogenate. DBM has been reported to antagonize the mutagenicity of several chemical carcinogens in vitro and has recently been shown to be even more effective than curcumin in suppressing the 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumors in rats. But there are no reports regarding its antimutagenic properties against cooked food mutagens. Results of the present investigations clearly indicate that dibenzoylmethane is a very potent antimutagenic agent, that could effectively inhibit mutagenicity induced by all the tested cooked food mutagens in both the frame shift (TA98) as well as the base pair mutation sensitive (TA100) strains of S. typhimurium. These highly potent inhibitory effects of dibenzoylmethane against heterocyclic amines observed in our preliminary investigations strongly warrant further studies of its efficacy as a cancer chemopreventive agent.",Is Glu-P-1 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

In the present investigations, curcumin as well as its two natural analogues i.e., dmC and bdmC were found to be highly effective in suppressing genotoxicity of all the tested cooked food mutagens in a dose-dependent manner, in both the frame shift (TA98) as well as base pair mutation sensitive (TA100) strains of S. typhimurium. However, bdmC appeared to be a relatively less active antimutagen compared to C and dmC. More than 80% inhibition of mutagenicity was observed at 200 microg/plate in case of C and dmC in both TA98 and TA100 against all tested cooked food mutagens. Where as, bdmC showed 39-79% inhibition in TA100 and 60-80% inhibition in TA98, at a dose of 200 microg/plate. These findings warrant further biochemical, enzymatic and in vivo investigations in animal models as well as in humans to establish the chemoprotective effect of these agents against mutagenic heterocyclic amines found in cooked food.",Is bisdemethoxycurcumin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
336,"Hericium erinaceus is valuable in the diet and in medical treatment. It contains water-soluble polysaccharides that have been found to enhance immunity and which show anti-artificial pulmonary metastatic tumor effects. In this study, water and ethanol extracts of the mycelium and fruiting body of Hericium erinaceus were examined by the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 to screen for antimutagenic effects against 5 mutagens: AFB1, B[a]P, Glu-P-1, NQNO, and Trp-P-1. We found that both extracts have the strongest antimutagenic activity against Trp-P-1, followed by Glu-P-1, B[a]P-1, AFB1, and finally NQNO. In addition, the antimutagenicity of the extracts was produced in a concentration-dependent manner. At a concentration of 200 ppm, both extracts showed the highest inhibitory action. However, the linear correlation indicated that concentration-activity relationship was not significant (p > 0.05). In addition, extracts showed less antimutagenicity after heat treatment (p < 0.05). This suggests that the antimutagenicity of the extracts is heat-labile. The ethanol extract from mycelium or fruiting body had better antimutagenic effects than did the water extract (p < 0.05). Also, the extract from the fruiting body had better antimutagenic effects than did that from the mycelium.",Is Hericium erinaceus mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
337,"This paper reviews the influence of DNA repair on spontaneous and mutagen-induced mutation spectra at the base-substitution (hisG46) and -1 frameshift (hisD3052) alleles present in strains of the Salmonella (Ames) mutagenicity assay. At the frameshift allele (mostly a CGCGCGCG target), DeltauvrB influences the frequency of spontaneous hotspot mutations (-CG), duplications, and deletions, and it also shifts the sites of deletions and duplications. Cells with pKM101+DeltauvrB spontaneously produce complex frameshifts (frameshifts with an adjacent base substitution). The spontaneous frequency of 1-base insertions or concerted (templated) mutations is unaffected by DNA repair, and neither mutation is inducible by mutagens. Glu-P-1, 1-nitropyrene (1NP), and 2-acetylaminofluorene (2AAF) induce only hotspot mutations and are unaffected by pKM101, whereas benzo(a)pyrene and 4-aminobiphenyl induce only hotspot in pKM101(-), and hotspot plus complex in pKM101(+). At the base-substitution allele (mostly a CC/GG target), the DeltauvrB allele increases spontaneous transitions in the absence of pKM101 and increases transversions in its presence. The frequency of suppressor mutations is decreased 4x by DeltauvrB, but increased 7. 5x by pKM101. Both repair factors cause a shift in the proportion of mutations to the second position of the CC/GG target. With UV light and gamma-rays, the DeltauvrB allele increases the proportion of transitions relative to transversions. pKM101 is required for mutagenesis by Glu-P-1 and 4-AB, and the types and positions of the substitutions are not altered by the addition of the DeltauvrB allele. Changes in DNA repair appear to cause more changes in spontaneous than in mutagen-induced mutation spectra at both alleles. There is a high correlation (r(2)=0.8) between a mutagen's ability to induce complex frameshifts and its relative base-substitution/frameshift mutagenic potency. A mutagen induces the same primary class of base substitution in TA100 (DeltauvrB, pKM101) as it does in Escherichia coli, mammalian cells, or rodents as well as in the p53 gene of human tumors associated with exposure to that mutagen. Thus, a mutagen induces the same primary class of base substitution in most organisms, reflecting the conserved nature of DNA replication and repair processes.",Is Glu-P-1 mutagenic for pKM101 or TA100 strain?,True
338,"The antimutagenic effects of methanolic extracts of peanut hulls (MEPH) were evaluated by the Ames test. MEPH inhibited the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (NQNO), a direct-acting mutagen. MEPH also inhibited the mutagenicity of some indirect-acting mutagens and decreased in the order of 2-amino-3-methyl-imidazo(4,5-f)quinoline (IQ) > aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) > 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido(1,2-a:3',2'-d)imidazole (Glu-P-1) > 3 amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyridol(4,3-b)indole (Trp-P-1) > benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P for S. typhimurium TA98, and IQ > Trp-P-1 > Glu-P-1 > AFB1 > B(a)P for S. typhimurium TA100.",Is MEPH mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
339,"Lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus Stapf) was extracted with 80% ethanol. The extract was not found to be mutagenic in the Salmonella mutation test with or without metabolic activation. However, the extract was found to possess antimutagenic properties towards chemical-induced mutation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. Mutagenicity of AFB1, Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2, Glu-P-1, Glu-P-2, IQ, MNNG and AF-2, was inhibited by the extract of lemon grass in a dose-dependent manner, but no effect was found on the mutagenic activity of benzo[a]pyrene.",Is Lemon grass mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
340,"The antimutagenicity of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) prepared by refluxing D-glucose and L-tryptophan under various reaction conditions was determined by means of the Ames test. The dose of MRPs with 5 mg per plate showed no toxicity, and mutagenicity to Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 was used for antimutagenic assay. The mutagenicity of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo (4,5-f) quinoline (IQ) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido (1,2-a:3',2'-d) imidazole (Glu-P-1) toward TA98 was markedly reduced by the addition of glucose-tryptophan MRPs, whereas the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (NQNO) was not inhibited. The mutagenicity of IQ, Glu-P-1, and NQNO toward TA100 was also markedly reduced by glucose-tryptophan MRPs, but the mutagenicity of NQNO was only slightly inhibited. Greater antimutagenic effects of glucose-tryptophan MRPs were found when these materials were prepared at an alkaline pH. The optimum combinations of reaction conditions for obtaining antimutagenic MRPs to IQ were glucose-tryptophan molar ratio = 0.5:0.25 at pH 9.0 for 5 and 10 h, molar ratio = 0.5:0.5 at pH 11.0 for 10 h, and molar ratio = 1.0:0.25 at pH 7.0 for 15 h and at pH 11.0 for 15 h. The antimutagenic effect of glucose-tryptophan MRPs to IQ and Glu-P-1 was well correlated with their browning intensity, reducing power, and antioxidative activity. The antimutagenicity of glucose-tryptophan MRPs might be due to both desmutagenic and bio-antimutagenic effects.",Is L-tryptophan mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
341,"The antimutagenic effects of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) prepared by heating three sugars (fructose, glucose and xylose) and four amino acids (arginine, glycine, lysine and tryptophan) at 100 degrees C for 10 hr was evaluated in the Salmonella/microsome assay. The highest extent of browning was found in the MRPs of sugars-lysine and xylose-amino acids. The MRPs of xylose-amino acids showed stronger antioxidative activity and reducing power than did the other combinations. No mutagenicity or toxicity in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was observed with any of the MRPs in the presence of S-9. Most MRPs, especially those of sugars-tryptophan and xylose-amino acids, strongly inhibited the mutagenicity of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoline (IQ), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyridol-(4,3-b)indole (Trp-P-1) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido(1,2-a:3',2'-d)imidazole (Glu-P-1) in the presence of S-9. However, the MRPs of fructose-glycine and fructose-arginine increased the mutagenicity of Trp-P-1. The antimutagenic effect of the MRPs was well correlated with their antioxidative activity and reducing power. The mutagenicity of benzo[a]pyrene was moderately inhibited by most MRPs, but was increased by the MRP of glucose-arginine. Aflatoxin B1 mutagenicity was increased greatly by all the MRPs except that of xylose-tryptophan. The findings suggested that MRPs might have a bifunctional property of co-mutagenicity and antimutagenicity in certain cases.",Is MRPs mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
342,"Heterocyclic aromatic amines, derived from the pyrolysis of amino acids and proteins, are potent mutagens in the Ames Salmonella assay with rodent liver activation. Additionally, heterocyclic aromatic amines are multipotent carcinogens. We report evidence that these compounds are substrates for the hydroperoxidase activity of prostaglandin H synthase, as measured by alterations in UV/visible spectra, and are bioactivated to macromolecule-reactive species by this enzyme. Indirect electron paramagnetic resonance studies indicate that this activation may occur via a one-electron mechanism. 2-Amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) are direct-acting mutagens in TA98. The mutagenicity of IQ and MeIQ, but not Trp-P-2, were enhanced by activation with ram seminal vesicle microsomes (a rich source of prostaglandin H synthase). Subsequent experiments utilized the newly constructed tester strain TA1538/1,8-DNP6 (pYG 121), which has enhanced arylamine N-acetyltransferase activity. In this strain IQ, MeIQ and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido-[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1) were mutagenic with ram seminal vesicle microsome activation. 3-Amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) was a weak direct-acting mutagen, and was not activated by the ram seminal vesicles (RSV) system. The responses of IQ and MeIQ were markedly enhanced in TA1538/1.8-DNP6 (pYG 121), relative to TA98. These data are consistent with the involvement of prostaglandin H synthase-catalyzed activation in heterocyclic aromatic amine-induced extrahepatic neoplasia.",Is Glu-P-1 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
343,"In mammalian hepatic cytosol both acetyltransferase and sulfotransferase are involved in the activation of N-hydroxy derivatives of arylamines and arylamides. The role of acetyltransferase is also shown in Salmonella, whereas no rigid evidence is provided on the role of sulfotransferase in Salmonella. In Ames mutagenesis test without S9-mix, the number of revertants of Salmonella typhimurium TA98 induced was 10-fold higher with 2-hydroxyamino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f] quinoline (N-hydroxy-IQ) than with 2-hydroxyamino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (N-hydroxy-Glu-P-1). The extents of the binding to calf thymus DNA of N-hydroxy-Glu-P-1 were, however, 3.9 to 8.6-fold higher than that of N-hydroxy-IQ in both acetyl CoA- and PAPS-fortified rat hepatic cytosol systems. To understand the mechanism causing the apparent discrepancy between the results of the mutation and DNA binding, the activating capacities of cytosols of S. typhimurium TA98 and TA98/1,8-DNP6 strains on the binding of N-hydroxy-Glu-P-1 and N-hydroxy-IQ have been examined in comparison with those of rat livers. Although both N-hydroxyarylamines were activated by hepatic cytosols in the presence of PAPS, no significant DNA binding of these N-hydroxyarylamines was detected in the presence of PAPS and either one of the two strains of bacterial cytosols. In addition, both cytosols of TA98 and TA98/1,8-DNP6 strains showed no measurable activity on the sulfation of p-nitrophenol, suggesting no capacity for sulfotransferase-mediated activation of N-hydroxyarylamines in Salmonella. On the contrary, the extents of the acetyl CoA-dependent binding of N-hydroxy-IQ in cytosols of TA98, but not of TA98/1,8-DNP6, were respectively 6- and 9-fold higher than those in hepatic cytosols of male and female rats, although the extents of the binding of N-hydroxy-Glu-P-1 were rather higher in hepatic than in bacterial cytosols. In addition, the covalent binding of N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene to DNA was detected in hepatic, but not in bacterial cytosols, although the binding of N-hydroxy-2-aminofluorene was detectable in both hepatic and bacterial cytosols in the presence of acetyl CoA. These results indicate that the metabolic activating capacities of Salmonella and rat liver cytosols differ qualitatively, and the difference in the substrate specificity of acetyltransferase between Salmonella and rat livers may be involved, in part, in the difference of their DNA damage in bacteria and mammals.",Is N-hydroxy-Glu-P-1 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
344,"The umu test system is a newly developed method to evaluate genotoxic activities of a wide variety of environmental carcinogens and mutagens (Oda et al., 1985). In the present study, we further examined the abilities of 151 chemicals to induce umu gene expression in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. Among the chemicals examined, 72 compounds induced umu gene expression, which could be defined on a basis of increased beta-galactosidase activity by 2-fold over the background level. The potent genotoxic compounds without metabolic activation were adriamycin, bleomycin, daunorubicin, 1,3-dinitropyrene, 1,6-dinitropyrene, 1,8-dinitropyrene, N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, furylfuramide, methyl methanesulfonate, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, mitomycin C, 1-nitropyrene and 4-nitroquino-line-1-oxide. In the presence of S9, aflatoxin B1, 2-aminoanthracene, Glu-P-1, IQ, MeIQ, MeIQx, Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 also induced umu gene expression markedly. Several chemicals such as 2-acetylaminofluorene, 9-aminoacridine, azobenzene, benzanthracene, benzidine, diethyl nitrosamine, 1-nitronaphthalene, paraquat, potassium dichromate and sodium nitrite were weakly genotoxic and the induction by these compounds could be detected only when the incubation time was prolonged from 2 h to 5 h. Data are also presented that some of the chemicals such as dimethyl sulfoxide, m-dioxan, 5-fluorouracil and paraquat, which have been reported to be non-mutagenic in Ames/Salmonella assay, were found to be active in inducing umu gene expression, while the known mutagenic compounds including acrylonitrile, 4,4'-dinitrobiphenyl, furfural, methylene chloride, 1-naphthylamine, sodium azide, o-tolidine and o-toluidine were non-genotoxic in the present assay system.",Is Glu-P-1 mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
345,"The ability of 22 strains of intestinal bacteria to bind the mutagenic pyrolyzates--3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido-[4,3-b]indole [(Trp-P-1) CAS: 62450-06-0], 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido [4,3-b]indole [(Trp-P-2) CAS: 62450-07-1], 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole [(Glu-P-1) CAS: 67730-11-4], 2-aminodipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole [(Glu-P-2) CAS: 67730-10-3], 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline [(IQ) CAS: 76180-96-6], 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline [(MeIQ) CAS: 77094-11-2], and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline [(MeIQx) CAS: 77500-04-0]--was investigated and compared to their ability to bind to some dietary fibers (corn bran, apple pulp, soy bean fiber, cellulose, chitin, and chitosan). The pyrolyzates are potent mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines formed during cooking. Solution of these amines was mixed with aqueous suspension of bacterial cells or dietary fibers, and removal of these amines from the reaction mixture by centrifugation was defined as the binding. Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 were effectively bound to all gram-positive and some gram-negative bacterial cells, corn bran, apple pulp, and soy bean fiber. Binding of Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and cellulose was moderate, and to chitin and chitosan it was little. None but corn bran bound Glu-P-1 and Glu-P-2 effectively. Corn bran effectively bound all mutagens tested. The quantity of the binding of IQ, MeIQ, and MeIQx was dependent on the strain of bacteria and the kind of fiber. The mechanism of binding of Trp-P-2 to freeze-dried feces, Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC9018), and corn bran was investigated. The binding was pH dependent, occurred instantaneously, and was inhibited by the addition of metal salts. These results indicate that the binding was mostly due to a cation-exchange mechanism, but some irreversible binding of Trp-P-2 was observed, most notably to freeze-dried feces. The mutagenicity of Trp-P-2 for Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of S9 mix was inhibited by the addition of LC9018 or corn bran to the reaction mixture. The results indicate that bound Trp-P-2 did not cause mutation under the assay conditions.",Is Glu-P-1 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
346,"Nitroscanate (NSC) was found to be a direct acting mutagen in the Ames Salmonella tester strains TA100 and TA98 and this activity increased further in the presence of rat liver S9 mix. It was inactive in TA98NR and TA100NR, and weakly active in TA98/1,8-DNP6. A substantial fall in drug induced mutagenicity by pentachlorophenol, an inhibitor of acetyltransferase, in TA98, TA100 and YG1024 suggests the initial bioconversion of a nitro group to hydroxylamine and its further activation to the ultimate N-acetoxyarylamine. The refrigerated DMSO solution of the drug in the plate incorporation assay and freshly prepared solutions using the pre-incubation procedure indicated a fall in mutagenicity owing to the conversion of NSC to N,N'-bis-4-(p-nitrophenoxy)phenyl thiourea (NFPT). The drastic reduction in mutagenicity in the presence of 4-amino-4'-nitrodiphenyl ether (ANDE) and 4-aminodiphenyl ether (ADE) was also attributed to the conversion of NSC to the corresponding thiourea, a non-mutagen. The negligible mutagenicity of ANDE and its absence in ADE and 4-isothiocyanate diphenyl ether (ITDE) suggests that the mutagenicity of NSC is due to the nitro group, and the -NCS function is responsible for enhanced mutagenicity over nor-isothiocyanate 4-nitrodiphenyl ether (NDE).",Is Nitroscanate mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False

None of the compounds was mutagenic without norharman. In the presence of norharman, however, nitrobenzene, nitrotoluene, nitroanisole, nitrochlorobenzene and nitrobenzaldehyde exhibited mutagenicity only to S. typhimurium TA98 with S9 mix. This induction of mutagenesis with norharman was strong for the ortho isomers of every nitro-compound, weak for the para isomers, and was not observed for the meta isomers.",Is 91-23-6 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
348,"o-Nitroanisole is used as an intermediate for the preparation of o-anisidine and in the manufacture of azo dyes. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering o-nitroanisole (>99% pure) in the diet to groups of male and female F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice for 14 days, 13 weeks, and 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and mouse lymphoma cells. 14-DAY STUDIES: Groups of five male and five female F344 rats received diets containing 0, 583, 1,166, 2,332, 4,665, or 9,330 ppm o-nitroanisole. Mean body weight gains and final mean body weights of males in the 4,665 and 9,330 ppm groups were lower than those of the controls. Absolute liver weights were significantly increased in males receiving 1,166 ppm or more and in females receiving 583 ppm or more. Groups of five male and five female B6C3F1 mice received diets containing 0, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. Mean body weight gains and final mean body weights of males that received 250 ppm and females that received 4,000 ppm were significantly lower than those of the controls. No other chemical-associated effects were observed. 13-WEEK STUDIES: Groups of 10 male and 10 female F344 rats received diets containing 0, 200, 600, 2,000, 6,000, or 18,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. Final mean body weights and feed consumption by male and female rats receiving 6,000 and 18,000 ppm were lower than those of the controls. Hemoglobin and hematocrit values were significantly lower and methemoglobin levels significantly higher in males in the 6,000 and 18,000 ppm groups than in controls. Absolute liver weights were significantly increased in females that received 200, 600, 2,000, and 6,000 ppm, absolute kidney weights were significantly increased in males that received 600, 2,000, and 6,000 ppm, and absolute spleen weights were significantly increased in males and females that received 6,000 and 18,000 ppm. Groups of 10 male and 10 female B6C3F1 mice received diets containing 0, 60, 200, 600, 2,000, or 6,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. Final mean body weight gains, final mean body weights, and feed consumption by male and female mice receiving 6,000 ppm were lower than those of the controls. Hemoglobin and hematocrit values in males and females that received 2,000 or 6,000 ppm were significantly lower than those in the controls. The absolute and relative liver weights of females in the 600 ppm group and relative liver weights of males and females in the 2,000 and 6,000 ppm groups were significantly greater than those of controls. Lesions associated with exposure to o-nitroanisole were present in the urinary bladder, spleen, kidney, liver, testis, and uterus of rats. Diffuse hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder occurred in all male and female rats that received 6,000 and 18,000 ppm. A transitional cell papilloma occurred in one male and transitional cell carcinomas occurred in two males and three females receiving 18,000 ppm. Congestion of the red pulp and capsular hyperplasia of the spleen and hepatocellular hypertrophy of the liver were present in males and females from the 18,000 ppm groups. Multifocal degeneration and necrosis of the renal tubule epithelium with infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells were present in male rats that received 600, 2,000, and 6,000 ppm. At the 18,000 ppm level, degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium accompanied by loss of spermatogenic cells and decreased numbers of spermatozoa were observed in the testes of male rats, while uterine atrophy was observed in female rats. Hepatocyte hypertrophy of the centrilobular and midzonal regions of liver lobules was present in mice that received 200 ppm and increased in severity at higher exposure levels. 2-YEAR STUDIES: The doses selected for the 2-year study of o-nitroanisole in rats were based on lower mean body weights, reduced feed consumption, and increased severity of regenerative anemia in male and female rats receiving 6,000 and 18,000 ppm during the 13-week study. Groups of 6roups of 60 male and 60 female F344 rats received diets containing 0, 222, 666, or 2,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. Groups of 60 male and 60 female B6C3F1 mice received diets containing 0, 666, 2,000, or 6,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. After 15 months, up to 10 animals from each group were evaluated for chemical-related lesions. Survival, Body Weights, Feed Consumption, and Clinical Findings: Survival of male rats receiving 2,000 ppm was significantly lower than that of the controls due to increased severity of nephropathy. Survival of 222 and 666 ppm male rats and all exposed female rats was similar to that of the controls. Survival of groups of exposed male and female mice was similar to that of the controls. The final mean body weight of male rats receiving 2,000 ppm was lower than that of the controls. Final mean body weights of male and female mice that received 2,000 and 6,000 ppm were lower than those of the controls. Feed consumption by male and female rats was similar to that by the controls. The only clinical finding in male or female mice attributable to chemical administration was discolored urine. Neoplasms and Nonneoplastic Lesions: The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia was significantly increased in male rats that received 666 and 2,000 ppm and in female rats that received 2,000 ppm (males: 0 ppm, 26/50; 222 ppm, 25/50; 666 ppm, 42/50; 2,000 ppm, 34/50; females: 14/50, 11/50, 14/50, 26/50). Nephropathy occurred in all male rats; the severity increased with exposure level. Focal hyperplasia of the renal tubule epithelium was present in three males receiving 222 ppm and two males receiving 2,000 ppm. Renal tubule adenomas occurred in one male from each of the 222, 666, and 2,000 ppm groups, and renal tubule carcinomas occurred in two males from the 2,000 ppm group. Focal hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder was present in one female rat that received 222 ppm and two male rats and six female rats that received 2,000 ppm. A transitional cell papilloma occurred in the urinary bladder of one female rat from the 2,000 ppm group, and a transitional cell carcinoma occurred in another female from the 2,000 ppm group. The incidence of forestomach ulcers increased in male rats that received 2,000 ppm, and the incidence of focal hyperplasia of the forestomach increased with exposure level in male and female rats. In addition, squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach were present in one female receiving 222 ppm, one male receiving 666 ppm, and one male and one female receiving 2,000 ppm, while squamous cell carcinomas were present in one male receiving 666 ppm and one male and one female receiving 2,000 ppm. The incidences of pituitary gland adenomas in male rats and mammary gland fibroadenomas in female rats decreased with exposure level. The incidence of cellular alteration in the liver was significantly increased in exposed groups of male and female mice. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined), and hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma (combined) were significantly increased in male mice receiving 2,000 and 6,000 ppm. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma were significantly increased in female mice that received 2,000 ppm. STOP-EXPOSURE STUDY: Groups of 60 male and 60 female F344 rats received diets containing 0, 6,000, or 18,000 ppm o-nitroanisole for 27 weeks and were then maintained on control feed without further chemical exposure for up to an additional 77 weeks. Up to 10 rats from each group were evaluated for the presence of chemical-related lesions at 3, 6, 9, and 15 months. Survival and Body Weights: Survival of exposed male and female rats was significantly lower than that of the controls as a result of moribund deaths associated with significantly increased incidences of urinary bladder neoplasms, primarily transitional cell carcinomas. All male rats that received 18,000 ppm were dead by week 48 and all females that received 18,000 ppm were dead by week 61. Mean body weights of exposed male and female rats were lower than those of the controls throughout the study. Neoplasms and Nonneoplastic Lesions: Hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder was present in nearly all exposed male and female rats examined at the interim evaluations. A transitional cell carcinoma was first observed at the 3-month interim evaluation in a male rat that received 18,000 ppm. At the 6- and 9-month interim evaluations, transitional cell papillomas or carcinomas were observed in both exposed groups of male rats. Transitional cell carcinomas were observed at the 6-month interim evaluation in females receiving 18,000 ppm and at the 9-month interim evaluation in females receiving 6,000 and 18,000 ppm. Adenomatous polyps of the large intestine were observed in a small number of exposed rats at the 6-, 9-, and 15-month interim evaluations. At the end of the study, the incidence of adenomatous polyps of the large intestine was significantly increased in all exposed groups and carcinomas of the large intestine were present in four males and two females from the 18,000 ppm groups. The incidence of hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium of the kidney pelvis was significantly increased in exposed male and female rats and transitional cell papillomas were present in three males and one female that received 18,000 ppm. Transitional cell carcinomas of the kidney were present in one male receiving 6,000 ppm and six males and one female receiving 18,000 ppm. Transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder were seen in nearly all exposed male and female rats. Of the males and females receiving 6,000 ppm which were without carcinomas, three males and one female had transitional cell papillomas. Generalized centrilobular hypertrophy, focal hepatocellular necrosis, multifocal hepatocellular cytoplasmic vacuolation, and Kupffer cell pigmentation were observed in the livers of male and female rats at the 3- and 6-month interim evaluations; however, only Kupffer cell pigmentation was observed at the end of the study. Congestion of the red pulp of the spleen was observed in nearly all exposed male and female rats at the 3-, 6-, and 9-month interim evaluations but the incidence was only slightly increased in the 18,000 ppm groups at the end of the study. Degeneration and atrophy of the seminiferous tubule epithelium of the testes were observed at the 3- and 6-month interim evaluations in all male rats receiving 18,000 ppm. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: o-Nitroanisole was tested in two laboratories for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 with and without exogenous metabolic activation (S9). Positive responses were observed at both laboratories in TA100 with and without S9 activation. One laboratory found no increase in mutations, while the second laboratory detected a weakly positive response in TA1535 without S9. No mutagenic activity was observed in the other tester strains. o-Nitroanisole was positive in the mouse lymphoma assay for induction of trifluorothymidine resistance in L5178Y cells without S9 activation. In cytogenetic tests with Chinese hamster ovary cells, o-nitroanisole induced a significant increase in chromosomal aberrations at the highest dose tested in the presence of S9 activation; sister chromatid exchanges were induced both with and without S9. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these feed studies there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole in male and female F344 rats that received diets containing 6,000 or 18,000 ppm for 6 months based on overall increased incidences of benign and malignant neoplasms of the urinary bladder, transitional cell neoplasms of the kidney, and benign and malignant neoplasms of the large intestine. There was a chemical-related increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats receiving diets containing 222, 666, or 2,000 ppm o-nitroanisole for 2 years. Marginally increased incidences of uncommon renal tubule neoplasms in male rats and forestomach neoplasms in male and female rats were considered uncertain findings. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of benign and malignant hepatocellular neoplasms. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas. Increased severity of nephropathy in male rats, and increased incidences of focal hyperplasia of the renal tubule epithelium and forestomach ulcers in male rats, and of transitional cell hyperplasia of the urinary bladder, focal hyperplasia of the forestomach, and hyperplasia of transitional epithelium of the kidney pelvis in male and female rats were associated with exposure to o-nitroanisole.

349,"Clerodendrum paniculatum L. (Family Verbenaceae) has been used as an antipyretic and anti-inflammatory drug in traditional Thai medicine. This present study investigated the in vitro anti-inflammatory, mutagenic and antimutagenic activities of the ethanolic extract of C. paniculatum (CPE) dried root collected from Sa Kaeo Province of Thailand. Murine macrophage J774A.1 cells were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to evaluate nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in the anti-inflammatory test while the mutagenic and antimutagenic potential was performed by the Ames test. The outcome of this study displayed that the CPE root significantly inhibited LPS-induced NO, TNF-α, and PGE2 production in macrophage cell line. In addition, the CPE root was not mutagenic toward Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 and TA100 with and without nitrite treatment. Moreover, it inhibited the mutagenicity of nitrite treated 1-aminopyrene on both strains. The findings suggested the anti-inflammatory and antimutagenic potentials of CPE root. ",Is CPE root mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
350,"Tetrandrine has been used for the treatment of silicosis in China. The potential genotoxic and carcinogenic hazards of this drug were studied using the Salmonella/histidine reversion assay and the SOS/Umu test. The results show that tetrandrine was weakly mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium TA98 with metabolic activation and did not induce SOS response. However, tetrandrine increased the mutagenic activity of benzo[alpha]pyrene, trinitrofluorenone (TNF), 2-aminoanthracene (2AA), diesel emission particles, airborne particles, and cigarette smoke condensate by more than 100%; the activity of aflatoxin B1 and fried beef was increased by over 75%. It also increased the 2AA and TNF-induced SOS response by more than 300%. These results indicated that tetrandrine was a weak promutagen inducing frameshift mutations and was a potent genotoxic enhancer. The mechanism for the genotoxic enhancement is not known. However, the fact that the increase in mutagenicity was noted only in TA98 and not in TA1538 suggested that the enhancement of genotoxicity by tetrandrine may result from an increase in error-prone DNA repair.",Is Tetrandrine mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
351,"By renitrating 3-nitrofluoranthene in the presence of fuming nitric acid, some additional nitro-derivatives were induced; they were identified as 3,7-, 3,9- and 3,4-dinitrofluoranthene (DNF), and two trinitrofluoranthenes (TNF, 3,4,7- and 3,4,8- or 3,4,9-isomers) on the basis of the results of mass spectrometry and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance. The yield of 3,7- and 3,9-DNF was about 61.3% in all of the derivatives induced. All of the DNFs yielded positive results in the rec-assay system, inducing DNA-damaging activity in Bacillus subtilis. Both 3,7- and 3,9-DNF converted Salmonella typhimurium His- strains TA98, TA97 and TA1538 from autotrophy to prototrophy, indicating a frameshift-type mutation for both; for strain TA98, 3,7-, 3,9- and 3,4-DNF gave mutagenicity of 422, 355 and 15.5 His+ revertants, respectively, per nanogram, corresponding to the specific activity of 1,6-dinitropyrene (DNP), a powerful mutagen.

352,"Mutagenicity induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (BHP) or cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) in Salmonella typhimurium TA102 was effectively reduced by flavonols with 3',4'-hydroxyl groups such as fisetin, quercetin, rutin, isoquercitrin, hyperoxide, myricetin, myricitrin, robinetin, and to a lesser extent also by morin and kaempferol (ID50=0.25-1.05 micromol per plate). With the exception of isorhamnetin, rhamnetin, morin, and kaempferol, closely similar results were obtained with both peroxides. Hydrogenation of the double bond between carbons 2 and 3 (dihydroquercetin, dihydrorobinetin) as well as the additional elimination of the carbonyl function at carbon 4 (catechins) resulted in a loss of antimutagenicity with the notable exception of catechin itself. Again, all flavones and flavanones tested were inactive except luteolin, luteolin-7-glucoside, diosmetin, and naringenin. The typical radical scavenger butylated hydroxytoluene also showed strong antimutagenicity against CHP (ID50=5.4 micromol per plate) and BHP (ID50=11.4 micromol per plate). Other lipophilic scavengers such as alpha-tocopherol and N,N'-diphenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine exerted only moderate effects, the hydrophilic scavenger trolox was inactive. The metal chelating agent 1,10-phenanthroline strongly reduced mutagenicities induced by CHP and BHP (ID50=2.75 and 2.5 micromol per plate) at low concentrations but induced mutagenic activities at higher concentrations. The iron chelator deferoxamine mesylate, however, was less effective in both respects. The copper chelator neocuproine effectively inhibited mutagenicity induced by BHP (ID50=39.7 micromol per plate) and CHP (ID50=25.9 micrommol per plate), the iron chelator 2,2'-dipyridyl was less potent (ID50=6.25 mmol per plate against BHP, 0.42 mmol per plate against CHP). In the absence of BHP and CHP, yet not in the presence of these hydroperoxides, quercetin, rutin, catechin, epicatechin, and naringenin induced strong mutagenic activities in S. typhimurium TA102. Radical scavenging activities of flavonoids against peroxyl radicals generated from 2,2'-azo-bis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH) as measured in the haemolysis test, confirmed that in general flavonoids with di- or trihydroxy hydroxyl functions especially in positions 3', 4', 5' are effective radical scavengers. In this test system, however, luteolin was the most potent compound, followed by epicatechin and eriodictyol. Again, isorhamnetin was a potent inhibitor of lysis of red blood cells despite the presence of a 3'-OCH3 function. Radical scavenging activities of flavonoids against the stable radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in principle obeyed the rules outlined above. Flavanones, tamarixetin, and rhamnetin, however, were only weakly active against DPPH, while isorhamnetin was again a potent compound. From these results we conclude that in the Salmonella/reversion assay with strain TA102 antimutagenic activities of flavonoids against the peroxide mutagens CHP and BHP are mainly caused by radical scavenging effects.",Is naringenin mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True
353,"The antimutagenic effects of 27 kinds of plant flavonoids on the mutagenicity of aflatoxin B1(AFB1) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine(MNNG) in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 were investigated. In the mixed applications of AFB1 (1 microgram/plate) with the flavonoids (300 micrograms/plate) in the presence of a mammalian metabolic activation system (S9 mix), chrysin, apigenin, luteolin and its glucoside, kaempferol, fisetin, morin, naringenin, hesperetin, persicogenin, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin showed the antimutagenic effect against AFB1 with more than 70% inhibition rate. A little or no antimutagenicities except flavone against MNNG (0.5 microgram/plate) were observed. For the antimutagenicity of the flavonoids on AFB1, the flavonoid structure that contains the free 5-, 7-hydroxyl group seemed to be essential. However, saturation of the 2,3-double bond or elimination of the 4-keto group did not affect the activity.",Is naringenin mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
354,"Several methylated analogs of fluorene were evaluated as mutagens in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 in the presence and absence of microsomal activation. Among the methylated derivatives of fluorene assayed were 9-methylfluorene, 2-fluoro- and 2,7-difluoro-9-methylfluorene, 1,9-, 2,9-, 3,9- and 4,9-dimethylfluorene, 2,3,9-trimethylfluorene and 2,7,9-trimethylfluorene. Mutagenic activity was observed for several of these fluorene derivatives in the presence of rat liver homogenate. The data support a previous observation that a single methyl substituent in the 9-position of fluorene is associated with mutagenic activity within this series of compounds. Substitution with fluorine at both the 2- and 7-positions of 9-methylfluorene was not associated with a loss of mutagenic activity as evidenced by the similar mutagenic activity of 2,7-difluoro-9-methylfluorene and 9-methylfluorene. However, 2,7,9-trimethylfluorene was not mutagenic under these assay conditions. 9-Methylfluorene, 1,9-, 2,9-, 3,9- and 4,9-dimethylfluorene and 2,3,9-trimethylfluorene were active as mutagens in the presence of rat liver homogenate, but were inactive as tumor initiators when assayed on mouse skin.",Is 9-Methylfluorene mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
355,"Acylfulvenes are a class of antitumor agents derived from illudin S, a sesquiterpenoid toxin isolated from mushrooms of the genus Omphalotus. Although DNA appears to be their major target, no data concerning mutagenicity of acylfulvenes are available in the literature, and limited data have been published on illudin S. Enzyme-mediated biotransformations have been demonstrated to influence the cytotoxicity of acylfulvenes. Illudin S and some acylfulvenes [e.g., (-)-6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (HMAF)] are allylic alcohols with potential for enhanced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity by means of metabolic sulfation. Therefore, we studied the influence of various heterologously expressed human sulfotransferases (SULTs) on biological activities of illudin S and HMAF in bacterial and mammalian cells. (-)-Acylfulvene (AF) was tested as a congener lacking an allylic hydroxyl group. We found: (1) all three compounds were mutagenic in standard Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100 and TA104; (2) they induced gene mutations (at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase locus) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in Chinese hamster V79 cells; (3) these effects were practically unaffected when human SULTs were expressed in the target bacteria or mammalian cells (using SCE as the endpoint); (4) illudin S demonstrated 40-600 times higher genotoxic activities than the semisynthetic acylfulvenes studied; it was positive in the SCE test even at a concentration of 0.3 nM; (5) genotoxicity in mammalian cells was observed at substantially lower concentrations of the compounds than required for a positive result in the bacterial test (400 nM with illudin S). We conclude that illudin S, HMAF and AF are potent genotoxicants and human SULTs do not play a significant role in their bioactivation. ",Is Illudin S mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

358,"Carbofuran (CF), an insecticide and nematocide, is metabolically oxidized to two less toxic forms, 3-hydroxycarbofuran and 3-ketocarbofuran. The N-nitroso derivatives of carbofuran and its metabolites were synthesized by reaction with nitrite under acidic conditions. Products of the reaction were obtained by extraction, identified by thin-layer chromatography, and purified by silica gel column chromatography. All three nitroso derivatives reacted positively with Gries reagent and gave characteristic triplet absorption spectra (387, 402, and 422 nm). Structural confirmation was by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy. Mutagenicity was determined by the Ames assay method with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. The nitroso derivatives of all three compounds responded similarly, given a mutation ratio of 45 at 5 micrograms per plate on TA100. In addition, all three produced chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Only two of the three (nitrosocarbofuran and 3-hydroxynitrosocarbofuran) were also capable of inducing large numbers of sister chromatid exchanges in the same cells. Observed variations in maximum mutagenicity in the Ames test and the ability to induce sister chromatid exchanges in CHO cells are consistent with the stability of the compounds in aqueous solution.",Is 3-hydroxycarbofuran mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
359,"22 arylmethane dyes which have been used as food colours, commercial dyes, laboratory stains and pH indicators were tested in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity assay. 8 mutagenic dyes were identified, including 5 food colours and 3 common laboratory strains; none of the 11 indicator dyes tested was mutagenic. The commercial and laboratory dyes Methyl Violet 2B C.I. 42535 and Crystal Violet C.I. 42555 were mutagenic in base-pair substitution mutation detector strain TA1535 in the absence of metabolic activation. By contrast, the food colours Benzyl Violet 4B C.I. 42640, Guinea Green B.C.I. 42085, Light Green SF C.I. 42095, Lissamine Green B C.I. 44090 and Violet BNP C.I. 42581 and the bacteriological stain, Basic Fuchsin C.I. 42500-42510, were all mutagenic in frameshift mutation detector strains TA98 and/or TA1538 and required metabolic activation. Most of these compounds gave weak mutagenic responses with Salmonella and were positive only within narrow dose ranges. Since conflicting results were obtained using dyes from different sources, minor dye components may have been responsible for their mutagenicity. This suggests the need to improve knowledge about impurities in arylmethane colours still used in food and to review the toxicological role of such impurities.",Is C.I. 42095 mutagenic for TA98 or TA1535 strain?,True
360,"The mutagenic environmental pollutants 2-nitrofluoranthene (2-NFA) and 3-nitrofluoranthene (3-NFA), labelled with 3H and 14C respectively, were incubated with Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98, its nitroreductase-deficient variant TA98NR and its O-acetytransferase-deficient variant TA98/1,8-DNP6, to investigate the activity of these metabolic pathways under conditions approximating those of the Ames assay, hence their contribution to mutagenic potency. 2-Aminofluoranthene (2-AFA) was the major metabolite of 2-NFA (4 microM) in all three TA98 variants, isolated by reverse-phase HPLC and identified by UV-vis and NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. 2-AFA was formed more slowly in TA98NR (65 pmol/h/ml resting phase bacterial broth, 1 to 2 x 10(9) bacteria/ml) than in TA98 (295 pmol/h/ml) or TA98/1,8-DNP6 (82 pmol/h/ml). 2-Acetamidofluoranthene (2-AAFA) was also identified in incubations with TA98 (80 pmol/h/ml), TA98NR (21 pmol/h/ml), and TA98/1,8-DNP6 (8 pmol/h/ml). 3-Aminofluoranthene (3-AFA, confirmed by UV-vis and NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry) was formed by all three variants from 3-NFA (4 microM): TA98, 1.76 nmol/h/ml; TA98NR, 0.55 nmol/h/ml; TA98/1,8-DNP6, 2.93 nmol/h/ml. 3-Acetamidofluoranthene (3-AAFA) was not detected in any of the variants. 3-AFA and 3-AAFA were less mutagenic than 3-NFA, and required S9 for activation. Mutagenicity of 3-NFA relative to initial nitroreduction rate was similar in TA98 and in TA98NR, but almost 10-fold lower in TA98/1,8-DNP6; hence O-acetylation considerably enhances the mutagenicity of reduction products of 3-NFA. Mutagenicity of 2-NFA relative to initial nitroreduction rate was similar in TA98 and in TA98/1,8-DNP6; the bacterial genotoxicity of 2-NFA is therefore largely independent of O-acetyltransferase activity. Ratios of mutagenicity to nitroreduction rate were similar in TA98 for 2-NFA and 3-NFA; differences in the potency of these isomers arise primarily from their respective suitabilities as substrates for nitroreductase enzymes.",Is 3-nitrofluoranthene mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

362,"16 heterocyclic nitrogen mustards (ICR compounds), which were synthesized for use as possible antitumor agents by Creech and coworkers, were tested for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1536, TA1537, TA1538, TA98 and TA100. The compounds were incorporated into the top agar at 5 doses: 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 micrograms/plate. All of the compounds were negative in TA1535 except ICR 449, which was positive in all 6 strains. The other 15 compounds were positive in the remaining strains with the following exceptions: ICR 371 and 355 were negative in TA100; ICR 445 was negative in TA98 and TA100; and ICR 360 was negative in TA1537, TA1538, TA98 and TA100. Good qualitative agreement was observed between the mutagenic and antitumor activities of the 16 compounds, and between the mutagenic and carcinogenic activities of the 5 compounds that have been tested for carcinogenicity by Peck and coworkers. However, no significant correlation was found between mutagenic potency in Salmonella and antitumor potency in mice for the 16 compounds. Also, for the 5 compounds that have been tested for carcinogenicity, no significant correlation was found between their mutagenic potency in Salmonella and their carcinogenic potency in mice. In Salmonella, the secondary (2 degrees) amines generally were more mutagenic than their tertiary (3 degrees) amine homologs, although the opposite result has been reported in certain eukaryotes. Relationships between structures and potencies for the different nuclei of the 16 ICR compounds are discussed, as are similarities and differences in strain sensitivities.

These compounds can be grouped in three series: aldehydes, ketones and enolizable ketones (1,2-cyclohexanedione). In each of the two first groups the mutagenic activity decreases when the size of the substituent increases. No relation was found between the mutagenicity and the molecular electronic and/or resonance parameters. The low or non-existent activity of some of the chemicals studied is discussed.

364,"The genotoxic environmental contaminant 1-nitropyrene is metabolised in mammalian systems by pathways more complex than the straightforward nitroreduction which accounts for most of its biological activity in bacteria. In order to evaluate the role of O-acetyltransferase (OAT) activity in generation of genotoxic intermediates from 1-nitropyrene, the mutagenicity of the major primary oxidised metabolites of 1-nitropyrene was characterised in the Ames Salmonella typhimurium plate incorporation assay with strain TA98, and with variants of TA98 deficient (TA98/1,8-DNP6) or enhanced (YG1024) in O-acetyltransferase. 1-Nitropyren-3-ol was more mutagenic in the absence than in the presence of S9, while 1-nitropyren-4-ol, 1-nitropyren-6-ol and 1-nitropyren-8-ol required S9 for maximum expression of mutagenicity. 1-Nitropyren-4-ol (176 rev/nmol without S9, 467 rev/nmol with S9 in TA98) and 1-nitropyren-6-ol (13 rev/nmol without S9, 266 rev/nmol with S9 in TA98) were overall the most potent nitropyrenol isomers assayed. 1-Acetamidopyren-8-ol and 1-acetamidopyrene 4,5-quinone were only minimally active. 1-Acetamidopyren-3-ol exhibited direct-acting mutagenicity. 1-Acetamidopyren-6-ol, previously shown to be a major contributor to mutagenicity in the urines of rats dosed with 1-nitropyrene (Ball et al., 1984b), was confirmed as a potent (359 rev/nmol) S9-dependent mutagen. Both the direct-acting and the S9-dependent mutagenicity of all the compounds studied was enhanced in the OAT-overproducing strain and much diminished (though not always entirely lost) in the OAT-deficient strain, showing that OAT amplifies expression of the genotoxicity of these compounds. 1-Acetamidopyren-6-ol required both S9 and OAT activity in order to exhibit any mutagenicity; this finding strongly implicates N-hydroxylation followed by O-esterification, as opposed to further S9-catalyzed ring oxidation, as a major route of activation for urinary metabolites of 1-nitropyrene.",Is 1-Acetamidopyren-6-ol mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

Miral's mutagenic and genotoxic activities, however, are not known. In this study, such activities of the pesticide were evaluated using the Salmonella TA98/S9 test and the chromosome aberration assay in bone marrow cells of Swiss albino CD1 male mice. All doses tested with Salmonella in the presence of S9 mix (3.2, 16, 80, 400 and 2000 micrograms/plate) induced a mutagenic response that was three times the spontaneous mutation frequency. The mutagenic response without S9 was twice the spontaneous frequency. Based on a 4-day treatment (i.p.) of mice with Miral, the median lethal dose (LD50) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) were 912.5 mg/kg and 730 mg/kg, respectively. A significant dose-dependent cell cycle delay (r2 = 0.85, p < 0.01) was observed in bone marrow cells when mice were treated for 24 h with 73, 146, 219, 292, 365, 438, 511, 584, 657 and 730 mg/kg. Significant increase in mitotic indices (p < 0.02) and chromosome aberrations (p < 0.05) were induced in bone marrow cells, when mice were treated for 18 h with the highest dose 511 mg/kg.

367,"Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is currently being considered as an alternate to chlorine as a disinfectant for water treatment. Many organic compounds present in water and food treated with ClO2 are subject to oxidation. 21 amino acids and 3 peptides (L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester (aspartame), L-glycyl-L-tryptophan and L-tryptophylglycine) were studied for their reactivity with ClO2. Chlorine dioxide reacted only with 6 amino acids in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0.

Reverse mutation test was performed with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537 without S9 mix. 0.02 M nitrosomethylurea (NMU) standard mutagen was used as a positive control. The results showed that the parent nonessential amino acid PCPA had no detectable genotoxic and mutagenic activities in bacteria. The methyl ester of this amino acid and its N-phenylacetyl derivative possessed weak genotoxicity. Meanwhile N-sec-butyloxycarbonyl, N-benzyloxycarbonyl, N-(p-nitrophenylacetyl) and N-(p-nitrophenoxyacetyl) derivatives of DL-p-chlorophenylalanine exhibited appreciable genotoxicity. Among the seven tested compounds only N-benzyloxycarbonyl and N-(p-nitrophenoxyacetyl) derivatives of DL-p-chlorophenylalanine have been found to be mutagenic. Only parent PCPA possessed antimutagenic properties in respect of nitrosomethylurea. The structural modification, which strongly affects genotoxicity and mutagenicity perhaps may be due to steric hydrance of the substituents, causing interference with enzyme and DNA interactions.",Is PCPA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
369,"Ten different amino acid-glucose Maillard browning products before and after reaction with nitrite were evaluated by the Ames mutagenicity assay. No mutagenic response was observed in the methylene chloride extracts of any browning products tested before nitrosation. However, mutagenicity was showed in most of the browning mixtures, e.g., glycine-glucose, lysine-glucose (I), arginine-glucose, phenylalanine-glucose (II), and methionine-glucose after nitrosation when examined by Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 either with or without S-9 metabolic activation. Among the browning mixtures, (I) and (II) showed the greatest mutagenic activity after reaction with nitrite. The mutagenicity of lysine-glucose with nitrite was dependent on browning intensity, nitrosation pH, nitrosation time, nitrite level and blocking agents.",Is lysine-glucose mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
370,"Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is currently being considered as an alternate to chlorine as a disinfectant for water treatment. Many organic compounds present in water and food treated with ClO2 are subject to oxidation. 21 amino acids and 3 peptides (L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester (aspartame), L-glycyl-L-tryptophan and L-tryptophylglycine) were studied for their reactivity with ClO2. Chlorine dioxide reacted only with 6 amino acids in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. The reaction with cysteine, tryptophan and tyrosine was too rapid to be monitored either iodometrically or spectrophotometrically. The reaction with histidine, hydroxyproline and proline was found to be pseudo-first order. ClO2 readily reacted with L-glycyl-L-tryptophan and L-tryptophylglycine but not with aspartame. Mutagenicity studies with the Salmonella microsome assay of the reaction mixtures of ClO2 with those 6 reactive amino acids and the 3 peptides indicated that the reaction products of the 3 peptides, hydroxyproline, and tyrosine exerted mutagenic activity toward both tester strains of TA98 and TA100 in the presence and absence of rat-liver S9 mix.",Is Chlorine dioxide mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
371,"Thirty-seven azo, xanthene and triphenylmethane dyes including FD and C colors currently approved for use in the U.S.A. and a number of delisted food colors, were tested in the Salmonella/microsome system. In addition to direct plate tests with five tester strains (TA1535, TA100, TA1537, TA1538, TA98), the azo dyes were also assayed after chemical reduction to their component amines. Also, a selected group of azo dyes was subjected to liquid tests (both aerobic with microsomes and anaerobic) and to plate tests involving initial 16 h anaerobic incubations to facilitate microbial reduction of the azo bond. None of the presently listed FD and C colors was mutagenic in any of the test modifications. Among formerly listed colors only Butter Yellow (p-dimethylaminoazobenzene), a recognized animal carcinogen, was mutagenic in the aerobic liquid test. Several other azo dyes were either directly mutagenic,  viz. Acid Alizarin Yellow R and Alizarin Yellow GG; required microsomal activation, viz. Acid Alizarin Red B and Methyl Red; or required chemical reduction and microsomal activation, viz. Acid Alizarin Violet N and Sudan IV. Of the non-azo dyes tested only two xanthene dyes appeared to be mutagenic, viz. 9-(2-sulfophenyl)-6-hydroxy-3-isoxanthenone and its 2,4,5,7-tetrabromo derivative.",Is 9-(2-sulfophenyl)-6-hydroxy-3-isoxanthenone mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True

None of the compounds was mutagenic without norharman. In the presence of norharman, however, nitrobenzene, nitrotoluene, nitroanisole, nitrochlorobenzene and nitrobenzaldehyde exhibited mutagenicity only to S. typhimurium TA98 with S9 mix. This induction of mutagenesis with norharman was strong for the ortho isomers of every nitro-compound, weak for the para isomers, and was not observed for the meta isomers.",Is nitrobenzonitrile mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
373,"Because both oxidative and reductive metabolism of the hepatocarcinogen 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) can occur in vivo, we have examined the mutagenicity of compounds which can be formed from 2,4-DNT in an attempt to establish which metabolic pathways contribute to the formation of genotoxic products. A quantitative reversion assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was used to evaluate the mutagenicity of these compounds. 2,4-Dinitrobenzyl alcohol, 2-amino-4-nitrotoluene and 2-nitroso-4-nitrotoluene were found to be more mutagenic to S. typhimurium than is 2,4-DNT and did not require metabolic activation by post-mitochondrial supernatants of Aroclor-induced rat liver homogenates (S9) for their effect. 2-Amino-4-nitrobenzoic acid was also mutagenic to S. typhimurium TA98 in the absence of S9, but its mutagenicity was enhanced when S9 was included in the incubation mixture. 2,4-Diaminotoluene required S9 for demonstration of mutagenicity and was approximately as effective, on a molar basis, as 2,4-DNT in inducing reversion to histidine prototrophy. These results suggest that both oxidative and reductive metabolism may be involved in production of mutagenic metabolites of 2,4-DNT.","Is 2,4-Dinitrobenzyl alcohol mutagenic for TA98 strain?",True
374,"Chalcones present several biological activities and sulfonamide chalcone derivatives have shown important biological applications, including antitumor activity. In this study, genotoxic, cytotoxic, antigenotoxic, and anticytotoxic activities of the sulfonamide chalcone N-{4-[3-(4-nitrophenyl)prop-2-enoyl]phenyl} benzenesulfonamide (CPN) were assessed using the Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation test (Ames test) and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. The results showed that CPN caused a small increase in the number of histidine revertant colonies in S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100, but not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The antimutagenicity test showed that CPN significantly decreased the number of His+ revertants in strain TA98 at all doses tested (p < 0.05), whereas in strain TA100 this occurred only at doses higher than 50 μg/plate (p < 0.05). The results of the micronucleus test indicated that CPN significantly increased the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE) at 24 h and 48 h, revealing a genotoxic effect of this compound. Also, a significant decrease in polychromatic/normochromatic erythrocyte ratio (PCE/NCE) was observed at the higher doses of CPN at 24 h and 48 h (p < 0.05), indicating its cytotoxic action. CPN co-administered with mitomycin C (MMC) significantly decreased the frequency of MNPCE at almost all doses tested at 24 h (p < 0.05), showing its antigenotoxic activity, and also presented a small decrease in MNPCE at 48 h (p > 0.05). Additionally, CPN co-administered with MMC significantly increased PCE/NCE ratio at all doses tested, demonstrating its anticytotoxic effect. In summary, CPN presented genotoxic, cytotoxic, antigenotoxic, and anticytotoxic properties. ",Is CPN mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False

376,"The mutagenic activity of garbage originating from a household wax industry was determined by the Salmonella/microsome assay, using the bacterial strains TA100, TA98 and YG1024. The garbage was obtained by sweeping the floor of the factory at the end of the work shift. Organic compounds were extracted by ultrasound for 30 min in dichloromethane or 70% ethanol. After evaporation of solvent, these extracts (HFS: household-wax factory sweepings) were dissolved in DMSO, and were tested for the mutagenic activity at varying concentrations (HFS-ET: 0.08-0.68 mg/plate, HFS-DCM: 0.60-7.31 mg/plate). The colouring agents (pigments) used in the production of the wax were also dissolved in DMSO and tested with the assay. The concentrations tested for each pigment were: Amaranth: 0.46-3.65 mg/plate, Auramine: 0.15-1.2 mg/plate and Rhodamine B: 0.22-1.82 mg/plate. Both ET and DCM organic extracts had mutagenic activity, especially in the YG1024 strain. The pigments behaved in a similar way, demonstrating that YG1024 was the most sensitive strain for the detection of mutagenicity, and that metabolization increased the activity. Human exposure (occupational and non-occupational) to industrial residues generated during the household-wax manufacturing and packaging process should be monitored, since this type of garbage is normally deposited in the environment without any control.",Is Rhodamine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
377,"Rhodamine B is used as a marker dye in herbicide sprays. There is evidence that spray operators and others may absorb rhodamine B through the skin. This study was undertaken to investigate the in vivo mutagenicity of rhodamine B, to compare the in vitro mutagenicity of two commercial preparations of the dye with that of known mutagens including rhodamine 6G and to elucidate the pharmacokinetics of rhodamine B in the rabbit. Following the i.v. treatment of adult female New Zealand White rabbits with rhodamine B (1 mg/kg body wt), the plasma concentration of rhodamine B decreased rapidly and was accompanied by the appearance of at least four fluorescent polar metabolites. These metabolites, as well as a very small amount of rhodamine B, were also present in the urine which, when tested in the Ames assay was not significantly mutagenic against Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 either with or without metabolic activation. Urine from a human subject who had been contaminated with marker dye was also non-mutagenic. Both commercial preparations of rhodamine B were found to be weakly mutagenic, using the same assay system. It is concluded that while appropriate hygiene measures should be exercised by users of products containing this dye, the results do not support the hypothesis that rhodamine B is a genotoxic hazard in the mammalian organism.",Is Rhodamine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
378,"The mutagenicity of 43 industrial chemicals in Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA1538) and Escherichia coli (WP2uvrA) was examined. The output of these chemicals in Japan is more than a million kilograms per year. The mutation test was carried out under the condition of absence and presence of rat microsomal activation. Two chemicals, hexamethylenetetramine and 4,4'-methylenediphenyldiisocyanate, showed mutagenic activity in S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100 by metabolic activation. Hexamethylenetetramine also showed mutagenic activity in TA98 without microsomal activation.

379,"The objective of the present study is to evaluate Polyethylene sebacate (PES) for its toxicity profile including oral toxicity, genotoxicity and mutagenicity. PES was synthesised, and characterised by gel permeation chromatography, FTIR, (1)H-NMR, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. Oral toxicity studies revealed PES to be nontoxic up to 3000 mg/kg body weight with no significant changes in serum biochemistry. The standard battery of genotoxicity tests including micronucleus test, chromosomal aberration and comet assay revealed PES as nongenotoxic. Mutagenicity of PES was evaluated using the Ames microplate format mutagenicity assay sample kit using TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium, both in presence and absence of Aroclor 1254 induced rat liver S9. Ames assay confirmed PES to be nonmutagenic. Periodontal implants of PES of varying roxithromycin/PES ratios and different diameter were prepared. A decrease in in vitro drug release was seen with increase in diameter of the implants. Release rates, however, increased with increase in PES concentration, and were attributed to decreased crystallinity of roxithromycin, confirmed by the DSC thermographs and XRD spectra. Roxithromycin release from the implants followed Higuchi kinetics and exhibited controlled release. The results suggest PES as a safe polymer for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications.",Is PES mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False

Potential genotoxicity and mutagenicity effects on Salmonella typhimurium (strain TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA1535) and Escherichia coli (strain WP2 pkM101) were evaluated. No genotoxicity effects were detected, whereas slight mutagenicity was highlighted by TA98 S. typhimurium. Ecotoxicity results evidenced effects approximately up to 14 and 20% with microalgae at 500 mg/L of MNEI and Y65R-MNEI, in that order. Macrophytes and crustaceans showed no significant effects.

381,"Soybean acid hydrolyzed extracts are raw-materials widely used for manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics products due to their high content of isoflavone aglycones. In the present study, the main sugar degradation products 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (HMF) and 5-ethoxymethyl-2-furfural (EMF) were quantitatively determined after acid hydrolysis of extracts from different soybean cultivars by a validated liquid chromatography method. The furanic compounds determined in samples cover the range of 0.16-0.21mg/mL and 0.22-0.33mg/mL for HMF and EMF, respectively. Complementarily, due to the scarce literature regarding the EMF toxicology, this study also assessed the EMF mutagenicity by the Salmonella/microsome test and genotoxicity by the comet assay. The results revealed that EMF did not show mutagenicity at the range of 50-5000μg/plate in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA97a, TA100, TA102 and TA1535, but induced DNA damage in HepG2 cells at non-cytotoxic doses of 0.1-1.3mg/mL, mainly by oxidative stress mechanisms. Based on literature of HMF genotoxicity, and considering the EMF genotoxicity results herein shown, purification procedures to remove these impurities from extracts are recommended during healthcare products development to ensure the security of the products.

382,"Effect of sugars added to ground beef on the generation of mutagenicity of cooked hamburger was investigated. Mutagenicity of hamburger was assayed by the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 strain with metabolic activation after the mutagens were purified by use of blue rayon. Intrinsic reducing sugar content in ground beef was estimated to be 0.07% (w/w). Mutagenicity of hamburger was sharply or delicately controlled by the amount of a reducing sugar added to ground beef. Mutagenicity was increased more than 2-folds by addition of 0.08% (w/w) glucose, fructose or lactose but decreased to about a half by addition of more than 0.67% (w/w) each of the reducing sugars. Mutagenicity of cooked hamburger was not influenced by addition of sucrose at the ranges between 0.08 and 0.67% (w/w). When red wine with 0.10% (w/w) equivalent amount of reducing sugars or white wine with 0.13% (w/w) equivalent amount of reducing sugars were added to the ground beef, mutagenicity of cooked hamburger was similarly increased 1.6-1.8-fold. Controlling the reducing sugar content in ground beef would be a simple way to regulate the mutagenicity of cooked hamburgers.",Is sugar mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
383,"The formation of mutagens after the heating of sugar-casein model systems at 120 degrees C was examined by the Ames test, using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100. Several sugars (glucose, fructose, galactose, tagatose, lactose, and lactulose) were compared in their mutagenicities. Mutagenicity could be fully ascribed to Maillard reaction products and strongly varied with the kind of sugar. The differences in mutagenicity among the sugar-casein systems were caused by a difference in reaction rate and a difference in reaction mechanism. Sugars with a comparable reaction mechanism (glucose and galactose) showed a higher mutagenic activity corresponding with a higher Maillard reactivity. Disaccharides showed no mutagenic activity (lactose) or a lower mutagenic activity (lactulose) than their corresponding monosaccharides. Ketose sugars (fructose and tagatose) showed a remarkably higher mutagenicity compared with their aldose isomers (glucose and galactose), which was due to a difference in reaction mechanism.",Is galactose mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
384,"Using the Salmonella/microsome assay, the antimutagenic effects of specific components of the extracts from eggplant fruits were investigated. The eggplant fruit juice exhibited an antimutagenic activity against 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) induced mutagenicity. In some of the fractions extracted with several organic solvents (acetone, petroleum ether, ethyl acetate; and methanol), the activity was recognized. No mutagenicity or toxicity for Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of S9 mixture was observed with any of the extracts. It is suggested that there are multiple components of the activities that exist in the eggplant fruit. We isolated lutein from the 84% methanol (methanol/water, v/v) layer, pheophorbide or chlorophyllide from the 70% methanol layer and tannins containing sugar-moieties from the water layer. Pheophytin a and b, Mg-free derivatives of chlorophyll a and b, were isolated from the petroleum ether layer as possible antimutagens. The pheophytin a with S9 mix inhibited by 30-40% the mutagenicity of Trp-P-2.",Is eggplant fruit juice mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
385,"Stevioside, a constituent of Stevia rebaudiana, is commonly used as a non-caloric sugar substitute in Japan. The genetic toxicities of stevioside and its aglycone, steviol, were examined with seven mutagenicity tests using bacteria (reverse mutation assay, forward mutation assay, umu test and rec assay), cultured mammalian cells (chromosomal aberration test and gene mutation assay) and mice (micronucleus test). Stevioside was not mutagenic in any of the assays examined. The aglycone, steviol, however, produced dose-related positive responses in some mutagenicity tests, i.e. the forward mutation assay using Salmonella typhimurium TM677, the chromosomal aberration test using Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line (CHL) and the gene mutation assay using CHL. Metabolic activation systems containing 9000 g supernatant fraction (S9) of liver homogenates prepared from polychlorinated biphenyl or phenobarbital plus 5,6-benzoflavone-pretreated rats were required for mutagenesis and clastogenesis. Steviol was weakly positive in the umu test using S.typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 either with or without the metabolic activation system. Steviol, even in the presence of the S9 activation system, was negative in other assays, i.e. the reverse mutation assays using S.typhimurium TA97, TA98, TA100, TA102, TA104, TA1535, TA1537 and Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA/pKM101 and the rec-assay using Bacillus subtilis.

386,"The mutagenicity of a new anthracycline (moflomycin) with potent antileukemic activity was studied by the Ames test in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA97a, TA98, TA100 and TA102), and compared to the mutagenicity of doxorubicin, widely used as antineoplastic agent. Unlike doxorubicin, moflomycin displayed no mutagenic activity in strains TA98 and TA100. Low mutagenicity was only observed in TA102 strain and was not enhanced after metabolic activation. This result indicates that moflomycin induce mutagenicity by reverting base-pair substitution. The structural changes in the sugar moiety may be involved in the reduced mutagenicity of moflomycin. The low mutagenicity of moflomycin shown in this study enhances the potential advantage of this new derivative which displays a high antileukemic activity.",Is moflomycin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
387,"Heat treatment of foods containing reducing sugars and amino acids during cooking or sterilization triggers a sequence of non-enzymatic reactions collectively known as the Maillard reaction. 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), one of the major intermediate products in the Maillard reaction, has been found to possess cytotoxic, genotoxic and tumorigenic activities, but the mechanisms of its toxic actions remain unclear. Formation of an electrophilic allylic ester bearing a good leaving group such as sulfate has been proposed as a possible metabolic activation pathway for HMF. In order to further test this possibility, we compared the mutagenic and carcinogenic activities of HMF and its chemically synthesized sulfuric acid ester, 5-sulfooxymethylfurfural (SMF). SMF induced dose-dependent increases in the number of His+ revertants in Salmonella typhimurium TA100. This intrinsic mutagenicity of SMF was significantly inhibited by ascorbic acid added to the assay media. In the presence of chloride ions, the bacterial mutagenicity of the highly polar sulfuric acid ester of HMF may also be mediated by formation of a lipophilic chloromethyl derivative. When topically applied to mouse skin, both sulfooxymethyl and chloromethyl derivatives of HMF exhibited higher skin tumor initiating activity than the parent hydroxymethyl compound. 5-Chloromethylfurfural was found to be a strong hepatocarcinogen in infant male B6C3F1 mice.",Is SMF mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
388,"The antimutagenic effects of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) prepared by heating three sugars (fructose, glucose and xylose) and four amino acids (arginine, glycine, lysine and tryptophan) at 100 degrees C for 10 hr was evaluated in the Salmonella/microsome assay. The highest extent of browning was found in the MRPs of sugars-lysine and xylose-amino acids. The MRPs of xylose-amino acids showed stronger antioxidative activity and reducing power than did the other combinations. No mutagenicity or toxicity in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was observed with any of the MRPs in the presence of S-9. Most MRPs, especially those of sugars-tryptophan and xylose-amino acids, strongly inhibited the mutagenicity of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoline (IQ), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyridol-(4,3-b)indole (Trp-P-1) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido(1,2-a:3',2'-d)imidazole (Glu-P-1) in the presence of S-9. However, the MRPs of fructose-glycine and fructose-arginine increased the mutagenicity of Trp-P-1. The antimutagenic effect of the MRPs was well correlated with their antioxidative activity and reducing power. The mutagenicity of benzo[a]pyrene was moderately inhibited by most MRPs, but was increased by the MRP of glucose-arginine. Aflatoxin B1 mutagenicity was increased greatly by all the MRPs except that of xylose-tryptophan. The findings suggested that MRPs might have a bifunctional property of co-mutagenicity and antimutagenicity in certain cases.",Is MRPs mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
389,"Heated sugar/amino acid reaction mixtures, known to contain products that are clastogenic and/or mutagenic to cells in vitro, were evaluated for clastogenic activity in mouse bone marrow using the erythrocyte micronucleus assay. Heated (i.e. browned) fructose/lysine reaction mixtures were also evaluated in the Salmonella his-reversion assay and the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell chromosomal aberration assay to confirm and extend previous in vitro observations. Significant mutagenicity of fructose/lysine mixtures was observed in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA2637, TA98 and TA102, with greater activity in mixtures heated at pH 10 than at pH 7. S-9 decreased the activity in strains TA100, TA2637 and TA98, but increased the activity in strain TA102. Both pH 7 and pH 10 reaction mixtures of the fructose/lysine browning reaction were highly clastogenic in CHO cells. Heated mixtures of fructose and lysine, and of glucose or ribose with lysine, histidine, tryptophan or cysteine, did not increase the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes in mice when administered by the oral route. This indicates the absence of chromosomal aberrations in erythrocyte precursor cells, and indicates that the genotoxic components of the browned mixtures are not absorbed and distributed to bone marrow cells in amounts sufficient to induce micronuclei when given orally. Because sugar/amino acid browning reactions occur commonly in heated foods, it is important to evaluate further the in vivo genotoxicity of browning products in cell populations other than bone marrow.",Is fructose/lysine mixtures mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
390,"The genetic activity of 2 commercial caramel preparations, manufactured either by heating the malt sugar solution directly (non-ammoniated caramel) or by heating it with ammonia (ammoniated caramel) was studied in the Salmonella mutagenicity test and UDS assay in cultured mammalian cells. The non-ammoniated caramel was found to be mutagenic to S. typhimurium TA100, while the ammoniated one was genetically active in all the tester strains used, namely TA100, TA97 and TA98. It was also demonstrated that non-ammoniated caramel was capable of inducing UDS in cultured human amnion FL cells, but for the ammoniated one, no such activity was observed. Furthermore, based on the results obtained in the DNA synthesis inhibition assay, it was suggested that the DNA synthesis inhibition seen in our experiments with the ammoniated caramel was probably not of DNA damage in origin. These data indicate that the mutagenic fractions formed during ammoniated and non-ammoniated caramelization were quite different.",Is non-ammoniated caramel mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
391,"Solutions of 2-deoxy-D-ribose and D-ribose were gamma-irradiated under different experimental conditions and tested for mutagenicity, with and without preincubation, in Salmonella typhimurium. The irradiated sugar solutions were mutagenic in the tester strains TA100 and TA98. Except for malonaldehyde (MDA), which is not mutagenic in the concentrations produced radiolytically, the relative mutagenicities of the individual radiolytic products are unknown. With irradiated solutions of 2-deoxy-D-ribose, a relationship was found between the level of non-MDA aldehydes and the mutagenicity in TA100. Heating the irradiated solutions of 2-deoxy-D-ribose resulted in a temperature-dependent reduction of the mutagenicity. Autoclaved, non-irradiated solutions of 2-deoxy-D-ribose were not mutagenic in the Salmonella test.",Is malonaldehyde mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
392,"The effects of adding sugars to high- and low-tar cigarettes on the mutagenicity of their smoke condensates were studied using Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98 with and without metabolic activation. The sugars tested were glucose, fructose, galactose, sorbitol, sucrose and lactose. The lowest mutagenicities observed with these sugars per mg of smoke condensate assayed on TA98 with metabolic activation were 37% (high-tar cigarettes) and 22% (low-tar cigaretts) of that of smoke condensate from untreated cigarettes. Addition of sugars increased the total amounts of smoke condensates, but the mutagenicities of the total condensates were also decreased by all the sugars, the lowest values being 35% (high-tar cigarettes) and 36% (low-tar cigarettes) of that of smoke condensates from cigarettes without added sugar. On assay with TA100 with metabolic activation, decreases in both specific and total mutangenicities of condensates of high-tar cigarettes were observed with all the sugars tested except galactose and sucrose. Treatment with glucose, fructose or sorbitol decreased the specific mutagenicity of condensates of low-tar cigarettes and glucose and fructose reduced also their total mutagenicity. The effects of added sugars were more marked when assayed on TA98 than on TA100 and of the sugars tested fructose and sorbitol had the greatest effects. Addition of sugars had no effect of the mutagenicity of cigarette-smoke condensate without metabolic activation.",Is sugar mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False

Therefore, the aim of this study is to perform in vitro genotoxicity tests with DON using the Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation assay (Ames' test), the comet assay and the micronucleus test in accordance with the OECD test guideline 487 in two human cell lines: the lymphoblastoid TK6 and the hepatoma HepaRG cells. DON gave negative results in the Ames' test performed, both with and without rat liver S9 on three strains TA98, TA100 and TA102. DON elicited cytotoxicity in TK6 and HepaRG cells but did not induce primary DNA damage. DON failed also to induce MN formation in TK6 cells with or without human and rat liver S9. After 24h of treatment, DON induced micronucleus formation in TK6 cells but only at concentrations producing more than 55 ± 5% cytotoxicity. In HepaRG cells, DON highly increased the caspase-3/7 activity but no micronucleus induction was observed. Taken together, our results suggest that DON could be considered as a non in vitro genotoxin.",Is Deoxynivalenol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
394,"Destruction procedures for dimethylsulfate (DMS), diethylsulfate (DES), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) have been investigated using treatment by 1 N NaOH, 1 N NH4OH, 1 M Na2CO3, and 1 M Na2S2O3. During the kinetic study of the destruction process, the determination of remaining concentrations of the alkylating agents was performed by the derivatization of p-nitrophenoxide to p-nitroanisole and p-nitrophenetole, which were separated by high performance liquid chromatography. The mutagenic activity of the destruction products was evaluated by the Ames test using Salmonella tester strains TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA102. The kinetics of destruction in every case followed a time-dependent exponential relationship. Solutions of 1 M Na2S2O3 showed the highest capacity for destruction of the four alkylating agents, half-lives of DMS, DES, MMS, and EMS being 0.14 min, 1.26 min, 0.60 min, and 5.26 min, respectively. No mutagenic activity was detected following complete destruction in 1 M Na2S2O3.",Is Na2CO3 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
395,"Recently a textile azo dye processing plant effluent was identified as one of the sources of mutagenic activity detected in the Cristais River, a drinking water source in Brazil [G.A. Umbuzeiro, D.A. Roubicek, C.M. Rech, M.I.Z. Sato, L.D. Claxton, Investigating the sources of the mutagenic activity found in a river using the Salmonella assay and different water extraction procedures, Chemosphere 54 (2004) 1589-1597]. Besides presenting high mutagenic activity in the Salmonella/microsome assay, the mutagenic nitro-aminoazobenzenes dyes CI Disperse Blue 373, CI Disperse Violet 93, and CI Disperse Orange 37 [G.A. Umbuzeiro, H.S. Freeman, S.H. Warren, D.P. Oliveira, Y. Terao, T. Watanabe, L.D. Claxton, The contribution of azo dyes in the mutagenic activity of the Cristais river, Chemosphere 60 (2005) 55-64] as well as benzidine, a known carcinogenic compound [T.M. Mazzo, A.A. Saczk, G.A. Umbuzeiro, M.V.B. Zanoni, Analysis of aromatic amines in surface waters receiving wastewater from textile industry by liquid chromatographic with eletrochemical detection, Anal. Lett., in press] were found in this effluent. After approximately 6 km from the discharge of this effluent, a drinking water treatment plant treats and distributes the water to a population of approximate 60,000. As shown previously, the mutagens in the DWTP intake water are not completely removed by the treatment. The water used for human consumption presented mutagenic activity related to nitro-aromatics and aromatic amines compounds probably derived from the cited textile processing plant effluent discharge [G.A. Umbuzeiro, D.A. Roubicek, C.M. Rech, M.I.Z. Sato, L.D.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate the possible risks involved in the human consumption of this contaminated water. With that objective, one sample of the cited industrial effluent was tested for carcinogenicity in the aberrant crypt foci medium-term assay in colon of Wistar rats. The rats received the effluent in natura through drinking water at concentrations of 0.1%, 1%, and 10%. The effluent mutagenicity was also confirmed in the Salmonella/microsome assay with the strains TA98 and YG1041. There was an increased number of preneoplastic lesions in the colon of rats exposed to concentrations of 1% and 10% of the effluent, and a positive response for both Salmonella strains tested. These results indicate that the discharge of the effluent should be avoided in waters used for human consumption and show the sensitivity of the ACF crypt foci assay as an important tool to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of environmental complex mixtures.",Is Disperse Orange 37 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
396,"The genotoxic and mutagenic effects of two commonly used organochlorine pesticides, lindane (LND) and endosulfan (ENS), and two commonly used organophosphate pesticides, chlorpyrifos (CPF) and monocrotophos (MCP) were assessed using in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test and in vitro Ames Salmonella/ microsome mutagenicity test. The results showed that these pesticides alone or in combination, induced significantly high frequency of micronuclei (MN) formation that increased with concentration of pesticides. All these four pesticides produced significant increase in the frequencies of micronucleated-polychromatic erythrocytes (MN-PCE) and decrease infrequencies of PCE in dose-dependent manner. The results indicate the suppression of proliferative activity of the bone marrow and increase in the extent of cell death. ENS and MCP showed mutagenic potential in Salmonella/ microsome assay. ENS induced mutagenic and nontoxic response only in TA98 tester strain of S.typhimurium at the dose of 500 μg/plate and in the absence of metabolic activation. MCP showed weak mutagenic and nontoxic effect only in TA100 tester strain at the dose of 5000 μg/plate in both assays, with or without metabolic activation when compared with negative control. MCP was toxic in TA98 tester strain at the dose of 5000 μg/plate in absence of metabolic activation while reduction in toxicity was seen on addition of S9 mixture. The study clearly showed the genotoxic potential of all these four pesticides and mutagenic response of endosulfan and monocrotophos.",Is MCP mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
397,"22 arylmethane dyes which have been used as food colours, commercial dyes, laboratory stains and pH indicators were tested in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity assay. 8 mutagenic dyes were identified, including 5 food colours and 3 common laboratory strains; none of the 11 indicator dyes tested was mutagenic. The commercial and laboratory dyes Methyl Violet 2B C.I. 42535 and Crystal Violet C.I. 42555 were mutagenic in base-pair substitution mutation detector strain TA1535 in the absence of metabolic activation. By contrast, the food colours Benzyl Violet 4B C.I. 42640, Guinea Green B.C.I. 42085, Light Green SF C.I. 42095, Lissamine Green B C.I. 44090 and Violet BNP C.I. 42581 and the bacteriological stain, Basic Fuchsin C.I. 42500-42510, were all mutagenic in frameshift mutation detector strains TA98 and/or TA1538 and required metabolic activation. Most of these compounds gave weak mutagenic responses with Salmonella and were positive only within narrow dose ranges. Since conflicting results were obtained using dyes from different sources, minor dye components may have been responsible for their mutagenicity. This suggests the need to improve knowledge about impurities in arylmethane colours still used in food and to review the toxicological role of such impurities.",Is Lissamine mutagenic for TA98 or TA1535 strain?,True
398,"Dithiocarbamate fungicides are widely used in agriculture for protection of vegetable crops and seeds. The mutagenicity spectra of ziram, thiram, zineb S-65 and ETU were determined by employing a battery of test systems included the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium (strains TA98, TA100, TA102, TA104, TA1535, TA1538), the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain D61.M) and the shallot Allium ascalonicum somatic cells. Plate incorporation assay with S. typhimurium demonstrated direct mutagenicity of ziram in TA100 and thiram in TA100 and TA98 whereas zineb S-65 and ETU were ineffective. Tests for mitotic chromosome malsegregation in S. cerevisiae D61.M gave positive results with thiram, zineb S-69 and ETU. In shallot somatic root-tip cells ziram, thiram and ETU induced different genetic damages e.g. mitotic disturbance, polyploidy and micronuclei.",Is ziram mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 strain?,True
399,"A total of 228 pesticides (88 insecticides, 60 fungicides, 62 herbicides, 12 plant-growth regulators, 3 metabolites and 3 other compounds) was tested for mutagenicity in bacterial reversion-assay systems with 5 strains (TA100, TA98, TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538) of Salmonella typhimurium and a strain (WP2 hcr) of Escherichia coli. 50 pesticides (25 insecticides, 20 fungicides, 3 herbicides, 1 plant-growth regulator and 1 other compound) were found to be mutagenic. 5 of them required metabolic activation (S9 mix) for their activities. Among various chemical groups, organic phosphates, halogenated alkanes and dithiocarbamates showed higher ratios of mutagens. Although 22 of the pesticides tested have been reported to be carcinogenic, 7 of them, i.e., captain, DBCP, EDB, EDC, ETU, HEH and nitrofen, were detected as mutagens in the present assay. Most of the other 15 non-mutagenic carcinogens were organochlorine pesticides such as alpha-BHC, chlorobenzilate, p,p'-DDT, dieldrin and quintozene.",Is ETU mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
400,"Biphasic Calcium Phosphate (BCP) with a ratio of 20/80 Hydroxyapatite (HA)/Beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) promotes the differentiation of human dental pulp cells (HDPCs). In the current study, the genotoxicity of locally produced BCP of modified porosity (65%) with a mean pore size of 300micrometer (μm) was assessed using Comet and Ames assays. HDPCs were treated with BCP extract at three different inhibitory concentrations which were obtained based on cytotoxicity test conducted with concurrent negative and positive controls. The tail moment of HDPCs treated with BCP extract at all three concentrations showed no significant difference compared to negative control (p>0.05), indicating that BCP did not induce DNA damage to HDPCs. The BCP was evaluated using five tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA102, TA1537 and TA1538. Each strain was incubated with BCP extract with five different concentrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation system (S9) mix. Concurrently, negative and positive controls were included. The average number of revertant colonies per plate treated with the BCP extract was less than double as compared to the number of revertant colonies in negative control plate and no dose-related increase was observed. Results from both assays suggested that the BCP of modified porosity did not exhibit any genotoxic effect under the present test conditions.",Is BCP mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 or TA1537 strain?,False
401,"Three short-term assays (the SOS chromotest, the Ames-fluctuation test and the newt micronucleus test) were carried out to evaluate the genotoxicity of five chlorinated propanones identified in several chlorinated waters (monochloropropanone, 1,1-dichloropropanone, 1,3-dichloropropanone, 1,1,1-trichloropropanone and 1,1,3-trichloropropanone). In the SOS chromotest, all the compounds except monochloropropanone were found to induce primary DNA damage in Escherichia coli. With the fluctuation test, all five chloropropanones showed mutagenic activity on Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100. The newt micronucleus assay detected a clastogenic effect on the peripheral blood erythrocytes of Pleurodeles waltl larvae only for 1,3-dichloropropanone and 1,1,3-trichloropropanone. Moreover, two structure-activity relationships are noticeable: (1) chloropropanones with chlorine substituents on both carbon positions (1,3-DCP and 1,1,3-TCP) are by far more genotoxic than chloropropanones substituted only on one carbon position (1,1-DCP and 1,1,1-TCP); (2) the increase of the number of chlorine substituents decreases the mutagenic activity (fluctuation test) of the chlorinated propanones studied.",Is chloropropanones mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
402,"The following organophosphates were tested for their ability to induce DNA damage in a rec-type repair test with Proteus mirabilis strains PG713 (rec- hcr-) and PG273 (wild-type) and point mutations in the his- strain TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium: O,O-dimethyl-O-(1,2-dibromo-2,2-dichloroethyl)-phosphate (NALED); trichlorfon-O-methyl ether (TCP-O-ME), O,O-dimethyl-(1-methoxy-2,2,2-trichlorethyl)-phosphonate; trichlorfon-O-methyl ether vinyl derivative (TCP-O-MEVD), O,O-dimethyl-(1-methoxy-2,2-dichlorovinyl)-phosphonate. All compounds were negative in the repair test but induced base pair substitutions in S. typhimurium. The mutagenicity of NALED is due to the direct alkylating ability of the parental molecule and to mutagenic metabolites generated by enzymatic splitting of the side chain. Glutathion-dependent enzymes in the S9-mix eliminate the mutagenic activity of NALED completely. Mutation induction by TCP-O-ME and TCP-O-MEVD is predominantly caused by the reactive O-methyl ether configuration of the side chain and is resistant to metabolic inactivation by NADPH- or glutathion-dependent enzymatic pathways in the S9-mix of mice.",Is TCP-O-ME mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
403,"Aristolochic acid (AA), the active compound found in Aristolochia extracts, has been used as a traditional medicine. However, products containing AA were withdrawn from the market in the early 1980s because AA was found to be a potent carcinogen. Some genotoxicity studies of AA were conducted after the carcinogenicity of AA was reported. The purpose of this study was to check the ability of simplified, screening tests for genotoxicity to indicate the genotoxic activities of AA. Four commonly used in vitro genotoxicity endpoints were examined. In a bacterial mutation screening test, AA was mutagenic to tester strains TA98 and TA100 with and without rat liver S9. In the L5178Y mouse lymphoma cell gene mutation test, mutagenic activity was observed at > or = 25 microg/ml with or without S9. A concentration-dependent increase in structural chromosome aberrations was observed in CHO cells, with significant increases at 50 microg/ml without S9 and at 25 microg/ml with S9. Significant increases in micronucleated binucleated cells were observed in CHO cells treated with AA at > or = 25 microg/ml with or without S9. These results demonstrated that the genotoxicity of AA would have been easily detected if simple screening versions of in vitro genotoxicity assays had been used during early product development. It is suggested that simplified screening tests such as those used in this study would be a rapid and economical way of obtaining the preliminary genotoxicity profiles of new substances or products as an aid to decision-making for further development.",Is Aristolochic acid mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
404,"Molds of the genus Alternaria are common food pathogens responsible for the spoilage of fruits, vegetables, grains, and nuts. Although consumption of Alternaria alternata-contaminated foodstuffs has been implicated in an elevated incidence of esophageal carcinogenesis, the mutagenic potencies of several A. alternata toxins seem unable to account for the levels of activity found using crude mycelial extracts. In this study, the mutagenic effects of nitrosylation were examined with the major Alternaria metabolites Altenuene (ALT), Alternariol (AOH), Alternariol Monomethyl Ether (AME), Altertoxin I (ATX I), Tentoxin (TENT), Tenuazonic Acid (TA), and Radicinin (RAD) using the Ames Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100. In the absence of nitrosylation, ATX I was mutagenic when tested from 1 to 100 microg/plate in TA98 with rat liver S9 for activation, while AOH and ATX I were weakly mutagenic +/- S9 in TA100. Incubation with nitrite generally increased mutagenic potencies with ATX I strongly mutagenic +/- S9 in both TA98 and TA100, while ALT, AOH, AME, and RAD responses were enhanced in TA100 + S9. However, subsequent examination of three extracts made from A. alternata culture broth, acetone-washed mycelia, and the acetone washes showed a different mutagenic response with both broth and acetone washes directly mutagenic in TA98 and TA100 but with a reduced response + S9. The acetone-washed mycelial extract was found to have the lowest mutagenic activity of the three extracts tested. Nitrosylation had little effect on the mutagenicity of any of the extracts. Thus, while nitrosylation increases the mutagenicity of ATX I, and to a lesser extent that of several other Alternaria toxins, the results demonstrate that Alternaria produces a major mutagenic activity with a S. typhimurium response different from that found with the purified toxins. Efforts are currently underway to chemically identify this mutagenic species. Published 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Is ATX I mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
405,"Apomorphine, N-nor-N-propyl-apomorphine, dopamine, L-DOPA, 6-hydroxydopamine and adrenaline were evaluated for genotoxicity using the Ames test and DNA repair-deficient and DNA repair-proficient Bacillus subtilis strains (rec assay, H17/M45; HLL3g/HJ-15). In the absence of an S9 liver homogenate, apomorphine induced frame-shift mutations in Salmonella typhimurium, mainly in strain TA1537; no indication of DNA-damaging effects in B. subtilis was observed. N-Nor-N-propyl-apomorphine was tested using strain TA1537 only and found to be mutagenic. Dopamine, L-DOPA, 6-hydroxydopamine and adrenaline were non-mutagenic when tested without S9, whereas they were all more toxic for DNA repair-deficient than for DNA repair-proficient B. subtilis strains, indicating a DNA-damaging potential. In a second set of experiments the mode of action of apomorphine and the relevance of the positive Ames test data were investigated. Glutathione in physiological concentrations reduced the mutagenic effect of apomorphine in a dose-dependent way, both in the presence and the absence of S9. S9 also reduced the mutagenicity of apomorphine. By comparing the effects of a complete S9 mix with those of a preparation without glucose-6-phosphate and NADP, it became clear that S9 also had an activating effect, overshadowed under standard conditions by its deactivating activity. Apomorphine was not mutagenic under anaerobic conditions. Superoxide dismutase and catalase reduced the mutagenic effect of apomorphine. All test conditions which reduced the mutagenic effect also inhibited the dark discoloration of the tester plates, indicating a retardation of apomorphine oxidation. It can, therefore, be concluded that oxidation of apomorphine leads to mutagenic products which induce frame-shift mutations in Salmonella typhimurium. This oxidation was prevented both by glutathione in concentrations well below physiological levels and/or by catalase and superoxide dismutase. Under these conditions, apomorphine was non-mutagenic in therapeutic concentrations as well as at higher dose levels. The possibility of genotoxic side effects occurring in patients treated with apomorphine as an emetic drug is therefore considered to be very unlikely.",Is Dopamine mutagenic for TA1537 strain?,False

408,"The antimutagenicity of ten flavonoids, differing in their hydroxylation patterns against direct-acting and indirect-acting mutagens, namely 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine, sodium azide, mitomycin C, benzo[a]pyrene, aflatoxin B1 and 2-aminofluorene, were compared with the aim of investigating how the hydroxyl groups in their structures govern the biological activity of flavonoids, by the Ames test, with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100 and TA102. The flavonoids tested were: quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, fisetin, chrysin, galangin, flavone, 3-hydroxyflavone, 5-hydroxyflavone and 7-hydroxyflavone. In these tests, all compounds were shown to be antimutagenic in more than one strain and various mechanisms of action were demonstrated. The results suggested that the number and position of hydroxyl groups may increase or decrease the protective effect, depending on the type and concentration of flavonoids and mutagen used. These studies contribute to clarifying the mechanisms by which these flavonoids act in protecting DNA from damage. This is required before they can be widely used.

409,"The mutagenicity of ten flavonoids was assayed by the Ames test, in <em>Salmonella typhimurium</em> strains TA98, TA100 and TA102, with the aim of establishing hydroxylation pattern-mutagenicity relationship profiles. The compounds assessed were: quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, fisetin, chrysin, galangin, flavone, 3-hydroxyflavone, 5-hydroxyflavone and 7-hydroxyflavone. In the Ames assay, quercetin acted directly and its mutagenicity increased with metabolic activation. In the presence of S9 mix, kaempferol and galangin were mutagenic in the TA98 strain and kaempferol showed signs of mutagenicity in the other strains. The absence of hydroxyl groups, as in flavone, only signs of mutagenicity were shown in strain TA102, after metabolization and, among monohydroxylated flavones (3-hydroxyflavone, 5-hydroxyflavone and 7-hydroxyflavone), the presence of hydroxyl groups only resulted in minor changes. Luteolin and fisetin also showed signs of mutagenicity in strain TA102. Finally, chrysin, which has only two hydroxy groups, at the 5-OH and 7-OH positions, also did not induce mutagenic activity in any of the bacterial strains used, under either activation condition. All the flavonoids were tested at concentrations varying from 2.6 to 30.7 nmol/plate for galangin and 12.1 to 225.0 nmol/plate for other flavonoids.

410,"Mutagenicity induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (BHP) or cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) in Salmonella typhimurium TA102 was effectively reduced by flavonols with 3',4'-hydroxyl groups such as fisetin, quercetin, rutin, isoquercitrin, hyperoxide, myricetin, myricitrin, robinetin, and to a lesser extent also by morin and kaempferol (ID50=0.25-1.05 micromol per plate). With the exception of isorhamnetin, rhamnetin, morin, and kaempferol, closely similar results were obtained with both peroxides. Hydrogenation of the double bond between carbons 2 and 3 (dihydroquercetin, dihydrorobinetin) as well as the additional elimination of the carbonyl function at carbon 4 (catechins) resulted in a loss of antimutagenicity with the notable exception of catechin itself. Again, all flavones and flavanones tested were inactive except luteolin, luteolin-7-glucoside, diosmetin, and naringenin. The typical radical scavenger butylated hydroxytoluene also showed strong antimutagenicity against CHP (ID50=5.4 micromol per plate) and BHP (ID50=11.4 micromol per plate). Other lipophilic scavengers such as alpha-tocopherol and N,N'-diphenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine exerted only moderate effects, the hydrophilic scavenger trolox was inactive. The metal chelating agent 1,10-phenanthroline strongly reduced mutagenicities induced by CHP and BHP (ID50=2.75 and 2.5 micromol per plate) at low concentrations but induced mutagenic activities at higher concentrations. The iron chelator deferoxamine mesylate, however, was less effective in both respects. The copper chelator neocuproine effectively inhibited mutagenicity induced by BHP (ID50=39.7 micromol per plate) and CHP (ID50=25.9 micrommol per plate), the iron chelator 2,2'-dipyridyl was less potent (ID50=6.25 mmol per plate against BHP, 0.42 mmol per plate against CHP). In the absence of BHP and CHP, yet not in the presence of these hydroperoxides, quercetin, rutin, catechin, epicatechin, and naringenin induced strong mutagenic activities in S. typhimurium TA102. Radical scavenging activities of flavonoids against peroxyl radicals generated from 2,2'-azo-bis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH) as measured in the haemolysis test, confirmed that in general flavonoids with di- or trihydroxy hydroxyl functions especially in positions 3', 4', 5' are effective radical scavengers. In this test system, however, luteolin was the most potent compound, followed by epicatechin and eriodictyol. Again, isorhamnetin was a potent inhibitor of lysis of red blood cells despite the presence of a 3'-OCH3 function. Radical scavenging activities of flavonoids against the stable radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in principle obeyed the rules outlined above. Flavanones, tamarixetin, and rhamnetin, however, were only weakly active against DPPH, while isorhamnetin was again a potent compound. From these results we conclude that in the Salmonella/reversion assay with strain TA102 antimutagenic activities of flavonoids against the peroxide mutagens CHP and BHP are mainly caused by radical scavenging effects.",Is kaempferol mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False
411,"The antimutagenic effects of 27 kinds of plant flavonoids on the mutagenicity of aflatoxin B1(AFB1) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine(MNNG) in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 were investigated. In the mixed applications of AFB1 (1 microgram/plate) with the flavonoids (300 micrograms/plate) in the presence of a mammalian metabolic activation system (S9 mix), chrysin, apigenin, luteolin and its glucoside, kaempferol, fisetin, morin, naringenin, hesperetin, persicogenin, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin showed the antimutagenic effect against AFB1 with more than 70% inhibition rate. A little or no antimutagenicities except flavone against MNNG (0.5 microgram/plate) were observed. For the antimutagenicity of the flavonoids on AFB1, the flavonoid structure that contains the free 5-, 7-hydroxyl group seemed to be essential. However, saturation of the 2,3-double bond or elimination of the 4-keto group did not affect the activity.",Is kaempferol mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
412,"The mutagenicity of senna glycosides and extracts of senna folium and senna fructus was investigated in the Salmonella typhimurium reversion assay. Senna glycosides were inactive in all strains, except for a slight, but significant increase in mutant frequency in TA102 in the absence and presence of liver microsomes. Extracts of senna fructus and senna folium demonstrated weak activity in TA97a, TA100 and TA102 in the presence of liver microsomes, and in TA97a and TA102 in the absence of liver microsomes. A strong increase in mutant frequency (3- to 5-fold above background frequency) was observed with all extracts in TA98 in the presence of liver microsomes. This activity increased further following enzymatic hydrolysis with hesperidinase of extracts of senna fructus from one source, and could be correlated to the release of the flavonol aglycones kaempferol and quercetin. The weak or lacking activity of anthraquinone aglycones in the tested strains of Salmonella typhimurium indicates that mutagenicity can not be attributed solely to the anthraquinone content of these plant materials.

The extracts studied differed greatly in their mutagenic potencies but exhibited a very similar mutation pattern in which the strongest effect was always seen in tester strain TA98 with S9 mix. Simultaneously we investigated the extracts for the presence of quercetin and kaempferol. Only quercetin was detected in small amounts by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The fractions containing quercetin were separated and collected using a Sephadex LH-20 column. Two different methods were employed to estimate the amount of quercetin in the extracts: a colorimetric assay developed by Christ and Müller, and a complexometric method by Belikov. The quercetin concentrations ranged between 2 mg (Tinctura Alchemilla) and 89 mg (Tinctura Hyperici) per 100 g of extract. We suggest that the mutagenicity of the 4 plant extracts is mainly due to the presence of quercetin for the following reasons: (1) all the plant extracts exhibit a mutation pattern which is very similar to that of quercetin, (2) the mutagenic potential of the extracts correlates well with their quercetin content, considering the fact that plant extracts are very complex mixtures often containing toxic or antimutagenic compounds.",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
414,"Hydrolysates of citrus fruit juice were mutagenic according to the Ames test. The citrus fruit juices were hydrolysed with 1 M HCl, hesperidinase, naringinase and human intestinal bacteria. The hydrolysates were successively extracted with n-hexane, chloroform, diethyl ether and ethyl acetate. The mutagenicities of extracts were assayed by the Ames test, and the mutagens were analysed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Mutagenicities of hydrolysates of citrus fruit juice were found in both the chloroform extracts and the ether extracts. The chloroform extracts were mutagenic to TA98 and TA100 with S9 mix, and the ether extracts were mutagenic to TA98 and TA100 with or without S9 mix. Some known flavonols such as kaempferol and quercetin were detected in the extracts of the hydrolysates by GC-MS. It is suggested that the mutagenicity of the extracts originated from those flavonols in the citrus fruit juice.",Is kaempferol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
415,"Hydrolysates of infusions of green tea and black tea were mutagenic by the Ames test. The tea infusions were prepared by a regular method and were hydrolysed with 1 M HCl, hesperidinase, naringinase and human intestinal bacteria. The hydrolysates were successively extracted with chloroform, diethyl ether and ethyl acetate. The mutagenicities of the extracts were assayed by the Ames test, and the mutagens were analysed by GC-MS. The ether extracts of the hydrolysates of infusions of both green tea and black tea were mutagenic of TA98 and TA100 with or without S9 mix. The most common mutagenic flavonols, kaempferol, quercetin and myricetin, were detected in the extract by GC-MS, and their combined mutagenicity represented about 70% of the whole mutagenic activity in the extract.",Is kaempferol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
416,"The charred surface of fish and beef showed strong mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium test strains when activated by S-9 mix of rat liver. The pyrolysis products of proteins and amino acids were also highly mutagenic. Among the pyrolysis products of amino acids, those of tryptophan, serine, and glutamic acid were most active. The new gamma-carboline derivatives, 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole, were purified from the pyrolysis products of tryptophan. These new compounds were stronger mutagens than aflatoxin B1 towards S. typhimurium TA98, a frameshift type mutant, and they also transformed cryopreserved Syrian hamster embryo cells in vitro. Tryptophan pyrolysate also contained the beta-carboline derivatives, norharman and harman, which are not mutagenic alone, but act as comutagens. A mixture of norharman or harman and nonmutagenic aniline or o-toluidine was strongly mutagenic. The mutagenicities of charred products of other foods, such as seaweed and garlic, are reviewed in this article. Flavonoids, such as kaempferol and quercetin, and glycosides of these flavonoles were mutagenic. The mutagenicity of cooked vegetables depends partly on these flavonoid derivatives. The already-known existence of benzol[a]pyrene and nitroso compounds in cooked food is also reviewed.",Is kaempferol mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
417,"Over 70 naturally occurring and synthetic flavonoids were screened for mutagenicity with 5 tester strains in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome assay: TA1535, TA100, TA1537, TA1538 and TA98. Frameshift mutagenicity was confined to the flavonols (flavon-3-ols) in strain TA98, TA1537 and TA100. The two most mutagenic falvonols, namely, quercetin (3,3',4',5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) and kaempferol (3,4',5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone), exhibiting 12 and 7 revertants/nmol in TA98 respectively, are also the most common flavonols occurring in plants. Other flavonols exhibited less activity (revertants/nmol): galangin (2.0), rhamnetin (0.45), kaempferide (0.24), fisetin (0.14), myricetin (0.12), robinetin (0.06) and morin (0.05). All of these flavonols apparently exhibited significant activation by Aroclor 1254 induced rat-liver microsome preparations (S9). However, subsequent study revealed that only those flavonols either lacking or possessing one B ring hydroxyl group had an absolute requirement for microsomal activation. Alternatively, quercetin with two B-ring OH groups is not activated by microsomal enzymes, but by soluble (S100) enzymes from liver which are apparently constitutive and not subject to the usual chemical induction. 3 flavonol glycosides, namely, quercetrin (quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside), rutin (quercetin-3-O-rutinoside) and robinin (kaempferol-3-O-galactosido-rhamnoside-7-O-rhamnoside), were found to be nonmutagenic. They could, however, be activated by a variety of mixed glycosidases incorporated in the usual pour plate procedure. The most effective enzyme mixtures were obtained from rat cecal bacteria and from the snail Helix pomatia.",Is kaempferol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
418,"Chloroform and Bromoform are two abundant trihalomethanes found in Algerian drinking water. The investigation of the mutagenic hazard of these disinfection by-products was studied by Ames test as prokaryotic bioassay to show their mutagenic effects. For this, Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains were employed. Both chloroform and bromoform showed a direct mutagenic effect since the number of revertant colonies gradually increase in dose-dependent manner with all concentrations tested with the two bacterial strains and these were both in the absence and presence of S9 metabolic activation. The genotoxic hazard was also studied by random amplified polymorphic DNA test on the root cells of Allium cepa as eukaryotic bioassay. DNA extracted from the roots of the onion were incubated at different concentrations of chloroform and bromoform and then amplified by polymerase chain reaction. This was based on demonstrating a major effect of disappearance of bands compared to roots incubated in the negative control (distilled water). The results showed that these two compounds affected genomic DNA by breaks although by mutations.",Is Bromoform mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
419,"Trihalomethanes (THMs) are the most prevalent disinfection by-products identified in chlorinated drinking water. Among the THMs, chloroform (CHCl3) generally occurs at the highest concentration in finished water, but the concentrations of each of the brominated THMs (CHBrCl2, CHBr2Cl, and CHBr3) can exceed that of CHCl3. Each of these four THMs was carcinogenic in rodents in chronic oral dosing studies. This study assessed THM mutagenicity in a strain of Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 that was transfected with rat theta-class glutathione S-transferase T1-1 (+GST). The +GST strain and its nontransfected parent strain (-GST) were employed in a plate-incorporation assay and exposed for 24 hr to the vapor of individual THMs at concentrations up to 25,600 ppm in sealed Tedlar bags. Base-substitution revertants were produced in the +GST strain in a dose-dependent fashion by CHBrCl2 but not by CHCl3. At 4800 ppm CHBrCl2, which produced a calculated agar concentration of 0.67 mM, there were 419 +/- 75 revertants per plate compared to a spontaneous level of 23 +/- 5. CHCl3 produced a doubling of revertants only at the two highest concentrations tested (19,200 and 25,600 ppm). These results indicate that bromination of THMs confers the capability for theta-class GST-mediated transformation to mutagenic intermediates at low substrate concentrations, suggesting the possibility of a similar activation route in humans. Further, the very low affinity of the GSH-dependent pathway for CHCl3 demonstrates that different THMs can induce adverse effects via different mechanisms, indicating that risk evaluations of THMs should not treat members of this class as if they shared a common mode of action.",Is CHBr3 mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
420,"1,3-Diphenylguanidine (DPG) has been used as a primary and secondary accelerator in the vulcanization of rubber. Exposure to 1,3-diphenylguanidine may occur as a result of dermal contact during rubber manufacture or from contact with the finished products. DPG is poorly absorbed through skin. Therefore, to evaluate the toxicity associated with systemic exposure, 2-week and 13-week toxicology studies were conducted by administering DPG in feed to groups of male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. Genetic toxicity was also evaluated in Salmonella typhimurium and in the micronucleus erythrocyte assay in peripheral blood from male and female mice. During 2-week studies, rats and mice received feed containing 0, 250, 500, 750, 1,500, or 3,000 ppm 1,3-diphenylguanidine. All rats and mice survived to the end of the study. Feed consumption and mean body weights of groups of rats that received 750, 1,500, or 3,000 ppm were lower than controls. No compound-related gross lesions were observed at the end of the study. The final mean body weight of female mice that received 3,000 ppm was 6% lower than the controls at the end of the study; however, no other effects attributable to chemical exposure were observed in mice. Based on these results the same exposure concentrations (0, 250, 500, 750, 1,500, and 3,000 ppm) were selected for the 13-week study; because of the poor palatability of the 750 ppm or higher dosed feed in rats, concentrations greater than 3,000 ppm were not considered appropriate. Six male rats and all female rats that received feed containing 3,000 ppm died or were killed moribund before the end of the 13-week study. Final mean body weights and feed consumption of male and female rats that received 1,500 or 3,000 ppm were lower than controls throughout the study. The values of several hematologic parameters were significantly different from the controls in groups of rats that received 1,500 or 3,000 ppm; however, these differences were attributable to reduced nutrient intake as a result of reduced feed consumption. Lower total serum protein, cholesterol, triglyceride, and creatinine concentrations were also considered to be the consequence of reduced nutrient intake. Alkaline phosphatase activity and bile acid concentrations were greater than the controls in most groups exposed to DPG and were considered to be an indication of cholestasis. Secretory depletion of the seminal vesicles and prostate gland, epididymal hypospermia, spermatogenic arrest, and significant reductions in the absolute weights of the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and testis were observed in male rats in the 3,000 ppm group. Uterine hypoplasia characterized by a reduction in uterine size due to thinner and less developed endometrium was observed in female rats that received diets containing 750 ppm or greater. The mean length of the estrous cycle was greater in female rats that received 750 or 1,500 ppm feed than in the controls. All mice survived to the end of the 13-week study. Mean body weights of males and females that received feed containing 750, 1,500, or 3,000 ppm were lower than the controls. Reduced organ weights relative to control for mice that received 1,500 or 3,000 ppm were related to low body weights of these groups. In mice that received 3,000 ppm sperm motility was reduced and the number of spermatid heads was greater than for control males, and the estrous cycle length in females was longer than that of the controls. 1,3-Diphenylguanidine was tested for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 with and without S9 metabolic activation enzymes. No mutagenic activity was observed in the absence of S9. With S9, positive responses were observed in strains TA98 and TA100, and an equivocal response was observed in strain TA1537. Results of a peripheral blood micronucleus test in B6C3F1 mice were concluded to be negative in males and equivocal in females. In summary, consumption of feed containing 1,3-diphenylguanidine for 2 weeks or 13 weeks was not associated with any histologic response which could be attributed to chemical exposure. Instead the observed changes were indicative of reduced nutrient intake and are consistent with similar changes observed in other studies of feed restricted rats and mice.","Is 1,3-Diphenylguanidine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?",True
421,"The antioxidant and mutagenic/antimutagenic activities of the fixed oils from Nigella sativa (NSO) and Nigella damascena (NDO) seeds, obtained by cold press-extraction from the cultivar samples, were comparatively investigated for the first time. The antimutagenicity test was carried out using classical and modified Ames tests. The fatty acid composition of the fixed oils was characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) while the quantification of thymoquinone in the fixed oils was determined by UPC 2  . The main components of the NSO and NDO were found to be linoleic acid, oleic acid, and palmitic acid. The results of the Ames test confirmed the safety of NSO and NDO from the viewpoint of mutagenicity. The results of the three antioxidant test methods were correlated with each other, indicating NDO as having a superior antioxidant activity, when compared to the NSO. Both NSO and NDO exhibited a significant protective effect against the mutagenicity induced by aflatoxin B1 in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains. When microsomal metabolism was terminated after metabolic activation of the mycotoxin, a significant increase in antimutagenic activity was observed, suggesting that the degradation of aflatoxin B1 epoxides by these oils may be a possible antimutagenic mechanism. It is worthy to note that this is the first study to assess the mutagenicity of NSO and NDO according to the OECD 471 guideline and to investigate antimutagenicity of NDO in comparison to NSO against aflatoxin.",Is NSO mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
422,"Antimutagenic activities of hexane extracts obtained from the fruit extract (UE) and the Kernels (KE) of P. mume were examined. These extracts showed inhibitory activities to known mutagens, 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide, benzo[alpha]pyrene and aflatoxin B1 in the Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98 strains. The UE and KE fractions were then separated by silicic acid column chromatography with a stepwise elution method using ether-hexane. The location of the active substances in the fractions was also determined by thin-layer chromatography. Consequently, it was found that the effective substances for the desmutagenicity were fatty acids, and identified by gas liquid chromatography, mainly as oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid in UE, and mainly as oleic acid and linoleic acid in KE, respectively.",Is KE mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
423,"By carrying out the pre-incubation of bacteria with N-nitrosamines under acidic conditions, the mutagenicity of N-nitrosodimethylamine on Salmonella TA100 and E. coli WP2 try, hcr was detected with increased sensitivity, compared to usual assays in neutral buffers. Using this modified assay system, compounds have been screened for their modulating effects on N-nitrosamine-mediated mutagenesis and the following were found to be inhibitors: cysteine, cysteamine, bisulfite, n-propylamine, n-butylamine, n-hexylamine, n-octylamine, n-nonylamine, serotonine, tryptamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine and oleic acid.

424,"Quercetin, rhamnetin, isohamnetin, apigenin and luteolin were isolated from medicinal herbs: Erigeron canadensis L., Anthyllis vulneraria L. and Pyrola chloranta L. The mutagenicity of these naturally occurring flavonoids was tested by the Ames method with S. typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1538, TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102 in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Of the above flavonoids only quercetin and rhamnetin revealed mutagenic activity in the Ames test. Quercetin induced point mutations in strains TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102 of S. typhimurium. The presence of S9 rat liver microsome fraction markedly enhanced the mutagenic activity of quercetin in these strains. Rhamnetin appeared to be a much weaker mutagen in the Ames test. The compound induced mutations in strains TA97, TA98 and TA100 of S. typhimurium but only in the presence of metabolic activation. Comparison of the structure of the studied flavonoids with their mutagenic activity indicates that the mutagenicity of flavonoids is dependent on the presence of hydroxyl groups in the 3' and 4' positions of the B ring, and that the presence of a free hydroxy or methoxy group in the 7 position of the A ring also probably contributes to the appearance of mutagenic activity of flavonoids in the Ames test. It also appeared that the presence of methoxy groups, particularly in the B ring of the flavonoid molecule, markedly decreases the mutagenic activity of the compound.",Is Rhamnetin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 strain?,True
425,"N,N-diethylphenylacetamide (DEPA), a promising new insect repellent, was tested for mutagenicity in the in vitro Ames Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. For the Ames test, DEPA was assayed both in the presence and absence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat-liver S-9 mix (5 and 20% S-9 fraction), using five tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium--TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102 and TA104. For the micronucleus test, mice were exposed to DEPA through ip injection for 2 and 5 days in separate experiments, and bone marrow and peripheral blood were sampled 6 and 48 hr after the final injection, respectively. DEPA did not induce a mutagenic response in the Ames test, and mouse bone marrow and peripheral blood micronucleus tests. DEPA was not considered cytotoxic, as a depression of the percentage PCE was not observed at any dose in the range of 1 to 100 mg/kg body weight with either treatment protocol of the micronucleus test.",Is DEPA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
426,"Trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) is a product of lipid peroxidation. In the presence of t-butyl hydroperoxide the racemic HNE readily converts to its epoxide, 2,3-epoxy-4-hydroxynonanal (EH), as a pair of diastereomers. In this study, the potential roles of HNE and EH as tumor initiating agents were assessed. The mutagenicities of HNE and EH isomers in Salmonella strains TA100 and 104 were examined. In addition, the tumor initiating activities of HNE and EH were evaluated in bioassays involving either topical application in CD-1 mice or i.p. administration in newborn CD-1 mice. In the mutagenicity assays, EH isomers induced similar levels of revertants in both tester strains, although EG isomers were previously shown to react with bases in DNA with different specificity (Sodum, R.S. and Chung, F.-L., Cancer Res., 51, 137-143, 1991). The major isomer induced approximately 20,000 revertants/mumol in TA100 and 15,000 revertants/mumol in TA104, whereas, the minor isomer induced approximately 40,000 revertants/mumol in TA100 and 20,000 revertants/mumol in TA104. HNE was, however, not mutagenic under the assay conditions. In the tumor bioassays, EH was a weak tumorigen in CD-1 mice upon topical application followed by TPA promotion, yielding 0.55 tumors/mouse and 40% tumor incidence at a total dose of 128 mumol/mouse versus 0.02 tumors/mouse and 5% tumor incidence in the control group. Both HNE and EH induced liver tumors in male mice, but not in female mice. However, the incidences were not statistically significant. EH administered i.p. at a total dose of 200 nmol/mouse exacerbated the chronic spontaneous nephropathy in newborn CD-1 mice. Although the incidence of mild nephropathy was comparable in both EH-treated and control groups, the incidence of more severe lesions in mice treated with 200 nmol/mouse was 21%; while it was 0% in the control group. Furthermore, two mice at each dose level of EH showed a tubule profile with complex hyperplastic lining, suggestive of atypical hyperplasia. Again, HNE was not as active as EH in these bioassays. These results suggest a possible role of EH in tumorigenesis associated with lipid peroxidation.",Is HNE mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False

None of these 27 acrylate esters appeared to be mutagenic in the standard Ames assay with TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98 and TA100, both with and without Aroclor 1254 or phenobarbital-induced S9 mix. A liquid incubation assay of methyl methacrylate, methyl, butyl and hexyl acrylate with TA100 neither gave any indication of a mutagenic activity of these compounds.",Is ethanediol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
428,"alpha-Asarone has shown a significant capacity to reduce the level of lipids, including cholesterol. However, several toxic and genotoxic studies have determined that its use may pose a risk to human health. Therefore, a series of compounds structurally analogous to alpha-asarone were prepared in order to maintain the same pharmacological properties but with low toxicity. In this study we evaluated the potential of three alpha-asarone analogues to induce mutagenicity using the Ames test (strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence of metabolic activation), as well as the induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in cultured human lymphocytes. The tested compounds were: 1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)propan-1-one (D1), 1-(2-chloro-4,5-dimethoxyphenyl)propan-1-one (D2), and 1-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrophenyl)propan-1-ol (D3). The results in the first assay showed no mutagenic effect for the three tested analogues; in the TA100 strain, certain cytotoxicity did appear in the case of D2 and D3 only at high concentrations. In regard to the SCE assay, compounds D1 and D2 presented no statistical differences in comparison with the control culture values; however, the high dose of D3 (300 microg/ml) produced a significant increment in SCE (68% above the control value). With respect to the mitotic index and the cellular proliferation kinetics, we observed a reduction when compounds D2 and D3 were used at the higher concentrations. Our results encourage further preclinical studies of these compounds in both in vitro and in vivo models (particularly for analogues D1 and D2), to determine their toxicological profile and establish the possibility of using them in humans.","Is 1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)propan-1-one mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?",False

430,"A novel pathway of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism involves the oxidation of non-K-region trans-dihydrodiols to yield o-quinones, a reaction catalyzed by dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DD). We have recently shown that in isolated rat hepatocytes (+/-)-trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo-[a] pyrene (BP-diol) was oxidized by this route to yield benzo [a] pyrene-7,8-dione (BPQ). We now report the disposition of BPQ and its mutagenic and genotoxic properties. Using [3H]BPQ it was found that 30% of the radioactivity was sequestered by rat hepatocytes into the cell pellet. Isolation of hepatocyte DNA provided evidence for a low level of covalent incorporation of BPQ into DNA (30 +/- 17 adducts/ 10(6) base pairs). Examination of the hepatocellular DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis following treatment with BPQ indicated that extensive fragmentation had occurred. DNA fragmentation was also observed when hepatocytes were treated with BP-diol and this effect was attenuated by indomethacin, a DD inhibitor. Hepatocytes treated with either BP-diol or BPQ were found to produce large quantities of superoxide anion radical (O2.-). The amount of O2.- generated by BP-diol was blocked by DD inhibitors. These data suggest that by diverting BP-diol to BPQ reactive oxygen species (ROS) were generated which caused DNA fragmentation. The ability of BPQ to cause DNA strand scission was further studied using supercoiled phi X174 DNA. It was found that BPQ caused concentration-dependent (0.05-10 microM) strand scission in the presence of 1 mM NADPH (which promoted redox-cycling) provided CuCl2 (10 microM) was present. Complete destruction of the DNA was observed using 10 microM BPQ. This strand scission was prevented by catalase and hydroxyl radical scavengers but not by superoxide dismutase. These data indicate that ROS were responsible for the destruction of the DNA. Using 20 microM (+/-)-anti-7,8-dihydroxy-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo [a]pyrene [(+/-)-anti-BPDE] only single nicks in the DNA were observed indicating that BPQ was the more potent chemical nuclease. BPQ was also found to be a direct-acting mutagen in the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102, and TA104, but was 10-5500-fold less efficient as a mutagen than (+/-)-anti-BPDE. Our data indicate that DD suppresses the mutagenicity of (+/-)-anti-BPDE by producing BPQ, but in doing so a potent chemical nuclease is produced which causes extensive DNA fragmentation via the generation of ROS.",Is BPQ mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
431,"Sulfur dioxide, a ubiquitous air pollutant, is a co-carcinogen for benzo[a]pyrene (BP). We have demonstrated previously that the interaction between sulfite, the physiological form of sulfur dioxide, and (+/-) -7r,8t-dihydroxy-9t,10t-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (anti-BPDE), the ultimate carcinogenic form of BP, results in an enhanced mutagenic effect in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. We report here that this same co-mutagenic effect of sulfite occurs in a mammalian cell line. Treatment of Chinese hamster V79 cells with 50 nM anti-BPDE, a concentration on the linear portion of the dose-response, resulted in a four-fold increase in mutations at the hprt locus relative to the spontaneous rate. When V79 cells were exposed to 1 or 10 mM sulfite immediately prior to the addition of anti-BPDE, the mutation rate increased by 73% and 210%, respectively, over that elicited by anti-BPDE alone. Sulfite itself was moderately cytotoxic, but caused no increase in mutation over the spontaneous rate. Characterization of the dose- and time-dependance of this enhancement of diol epoxide mutagenicity by sulfite closely resembled the effects seen previously in the bacterial system. In particular, enhancement by sulfite was evident when sulfite was added to the cells between 60 min and 1 min prior to the addition of the diol epoxide. Concurrent addition of sulfite and the diol epoxide attenuated the enhancement, and the effect was lost altogether when sulfite was added 10 min after the diol epoxide. The specificity of this effect of sulfite was shown by comparison with sulfate, which at concentrations of either 1 or 10 mM exhibited modest cytotoxicity, but neither was directly mutagenic nor able to enhance the mutagenic effect of anti-BPDE. Binding studies with labeled anti-BPDE showed that the addition of 10 mM sulfite increased binding of anti-BPDE to DNA by over 43%, corresponding to the observed increase in mutant frequency. Interestingly, this difference in level of DNA modification was not apparent after 30 min to 2 h exposures, but only emerged at the 4 h time point. The 4 h point was routinely used for all mutagenicity studies. Binding of anti-BPDE-derived materials to cellular RNA was not altered by 10 mM sulfite. The emergence of increased DNA modification at the latest time point suggests either a more prolonged period of active DNA binding than would occur with diol epoxide, or a difference in the ability to recognize and clear specific DNA adducts. Both possibilities are discussed in regard to the observed formation of 7r,8t,9t-trihydroxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a] pyrene-10c-sulfonate (BPT-10-sulfonate) in those incubations. BPT-10-sulfonate is a relatively stable BP derivative which retains the ability to covalently modify DNA.

(+/-)-7,8,9-Trihydroxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene-10-sulfonate (B[a]PT-10-sulfonate) is formed in high yields in incubations containing (+/-)-7r,8t-dihydroxy-9t,10t-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyre ne (anti-BPDE) and sulfite, and sulfite strongly enhances the mutagenicity of the diolepoxide toward Salmonella typhimurium under those conditions. Although B[a]PT-10-sulfonate itself shows little direct mutagenicity over a 1-20 microM concentration range, this reactive bay-region intermediate does enhance the mutagenicity of anti-BPDE in strains TA98 and TA100 by up to 280%. No significant enhancement was seen when up to 20 microM B[a]PT-10-sulfonate was used in concert with another direct-acting mutagen, N-acetoxy-acetylaminofluorene (N-AcO-AAF). The isomeric product derived from sulfite and (+/-)-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P-7,8-diol) is (+/-)-7,8,10-trihydroxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene-9-sulfonate (B[a]PT-9-sulfonate). Like B[a]PT-10-sulfonate, B[a]PT-9-sulfonate is not mutagenic to strains TA97, TA98 and TA100. This sulfonate exhibited little enhancing activity with anti-BPDE over a 1-20 microM concentration range, but did enhance the mutagenic response of strain TA98 to 0.2 microM N-Aco-AAF by up to 128%. Sulfite, anti-BPDE and B[a]PT-sulfonates were also examined for the ability to induce a forward mutation at the hgprt locus (8-azaguanine resistance) in strains of S.typhimurium. Sulfite caused a marked enhancement of forward mutation due to anti-BPDE in both TA98 and TA100. Surprisingly, concurrent administration of B[a]PT-10-sulfonate with anti-BPDE did not increase the number of mutant colonies. The extensive conversion of anti-BPDE to B[a]PT-10-sulfonate under conditions where sulfite enhances diolepoxide mutagenicity, when coupled with this enhancement of diolepoxide mutagenicity by B[a]PT-10-sulfonate in the reverse mutation assay, supports this novel B[a]P derivative as a mediator of the sulfite-dependent enhancement of B[a]P genotoxicity. Determining why this enhancing effect was not seen when selecting for mutation at the hgprt locus of S.typhimurium will require further study.",Is anti-BPDE mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
433,"Benzo(ghi)perylene (B(ghi))Per, (191-24-2)) and coronene (Cor, (191-07-1)) are major constituents of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) found in automobile exhaust and polluted air [eg, Grimmer et al, 1981]. Nitration of these PAH by NO2 and traces of HNO3, which are also formed in automobile exhaust, seems highly probable. To identify the presence of these nitroarenes in environmental samples and to examine their mutagenic potencies we synthesized and characterized nitro derivatives of both PAH. 5-NO2B(ghi)Per (81316-87-2) and 1-NO2Cor (81316-84-9) produced 405 and 340 revertants/nmole respectively in TA98 in the presence of 0.6 mg of microsomal enzymes (S-9) per plate in the Ames test. 5,8-diNO2B(ghi)Per (83292-25-5) and 5,10-diNO2B(ghi)Per (83292-26-6) produced 21,500 and 4,000 revertants/nmole in TA98 without microsomal activation. Mutagenicity for the dinitrobenzo(ghi)perylenes was also high in TA98NR and TA97 but was reduced by 97% in TA98-1,8DNP. There is close similarity in the orientation and distances between reactive sites (nitrenium ion and carbocation) on the dinitrobenzo(ghi)perylenes and 1,6-dinitropyrene (42397-64-8) and 1,8-dinitropyrene (42397-65-9).",Is dinitrobenzo(ghi)perylenes mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
434,"Previously, we isolated and identified anti-mutagenic and anti-inflammatory components from Vitis coignetiae (crimson glory vine, known as yamabudo in Japan) as 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (DBQ), fertaric acid and caftaric acid. We also reported that the oral intake of a partially purified fraction from yamabudo juice (yamabudo-fr) or DBQ affords significant protection against two-stage skin carcinogenesis in mice. In this study, we found that oral intake of yamabudo-fr or DBQ affords significant protection against a tobacco-specific nitrosamine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)-induced mouse model of lung tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we investigated the anti-tumorigenic mechanisms of yamabudo juice and DBQ. NNK is known to be a DNA-methylating and alkylating agent; thus, we investigated the anti-tumorigenic mechanisms of yamabudo juice and DBQ in relation to DNA methylation. Pretreatment with yamabudo-fr or DBQ dose-dependently decreased formation of O 6 -methylguanine and N 7 -methylguanine in DNA of the A549 human lung epithelial-like cell line treated with a methylating agent, 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine. Yamabudo juice and DBQ inhibited the mutagenicity of NNK in the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 but not S. typhimurium YG7108, an alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase-deficient strain (same as TA1535 but Δada st ::Km r , Δogt st ::Cm r ). Yamabudo juice and DBQ might accelerate the repair of DNA damage caused by NNK and reduce DNA damage to cells. We also investigated the effects of yamabudo juice and DBQ on signaling pathways in A549 cells. With or without epidermal growth factor stimulation, phosphorylation of Erk1/2, Akt and Stat3 in A549 cells was significantly decreased in the presence of yamabudo juice or DBQ, indicating that yamabudo juice and DBQ suppressed PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways. These results suggest that both initiation and growth/progression steps in carcinogenesis, especially anti-oxidant effects, stimulation of repair of alkyl DNA adducts and suppressed growth signaling pathways are potential anti-tumorigenic targets of yamabudo juice and DBQ in NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis.",Is DBQ mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,False
435,"A precise understanding of differences in genomic mutations according to the mutagenic mechanisms detected in mutagenicity data is required to evaluate the carcinogenicity of environmental mutagens. Recently, we developed a highly accurate genome sequencing method, 'Hawk-Seq™', that enables the detection of mutagen-induced genome-wide mutations. However, its applicability to detect various mutagens and identify differences in mutational profiles is not well understood. Thus, we evaluated DNA samples from Salmonella typhimurium TA100 exposed to 11 mutagens, including alkylating agents, aldehydes, an aromatic nitro compound, epoxides, aromatic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We extensively analysed mutagen-induced mutational profiles and studied their association with the mechanisms of mutagens. Hawk-Seq™ sensitively detected mutations induced by all 11 mutagens, including one that increased the number of revertants by approximately 2-fold in the Ames test. Although the sensitivity for less water-soluble mutagens was relatively low, we increased the sensitivity to obtain high-resolution spectra by modifying the exposure protocol. Moreover, two epoxides indicated similar 6- or 96-dimensional mutational patterns; likewise, three SN1-type alkylating agents indicated similar mutational patterns, suggesting that the mutational patterns are compound category specific. Meanwhile, an SN2 type alkylating agent exhibited unique mutational patterns compared to those of the SN1 type alkylating agents. Although the mutational patterns induced by aldehydes, the aromatic nitro compound, aromatic amines and PAHs did not differ substantially from each other, the maximum total base substitution frequencies (MTSFs) were similar among mutagens in the same structural groups. Furthermore, the MTSF was found to be associated with the carcinogenic potency of some direct-acting mutagens. These results indicate that our method can generate high-resolution mutational profiles to identify characteristic features of each mutagen. The detailed mutational data obtained by Hawk-Seq™ can provide useful information regarding mutagenic mechanisms and help identify its association with the carcinogenicity of mutagens without requiring carcinogenicity data.",Is alkylating agent mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
436,"The cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and mutagenicity of 1-chloro-2-hydroxy-3-butene (CHB), a known in vitro metabolite of the human carcinogen 1,3-butadiene, have not previously been investigated. Because CHB can be bioactivated by alcohol dehydrogenases to yield 1-chloro-3-buten-2-one (CBO), a bifunctional alkylating agent that caused globin-chain cross-links in erythrocytes, in the present study we investigated the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of CHB and CBO in human normal hepatocyte L02 cells using the MTT assay, the relative cloning efficiency assay and the comet assay. We also investigated the mutagenic potential of these compounds with the Ames test using Salmonella strains TA1535 and TA1537. The results provide clear evidence for CHB and CBO being both cytotoxic and genotoxic with CBO being approximately 100-fold more potent than CHB. Interestingly, CHB generated both single-strand breaks and alkali-labile sites on DNA, whereas CBO produced only alkali-labile sites. CHB did not directly result in DNA breaks, whereas CBO was capable of directly generating breaks on DNA. Interestingly, both compounds did not induce DNA cross-links as examined by the comet assay. The Ames test results showed that CHB induced point mutation but not frameshift mutation, whereas the toxic effects of CBO made it difficult to reliably assess the mutagenic potential of CBO in the two strains. Collectively, the results suggest that CHB and CBO may play a role in the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of 1,3-butadiene. ",Is 1-chloro-3-buten-2-one mutagenic for TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
437,"A systematic structure-activity relationship study of plicatin B (1), an antimutagenic constituent of Psoralea juncea, was undertaken with a view toward elucidating its chemical mode of action and possibly optimizing its antimutagenic activity during the process. Compound 1 and its related analogues were examined for their antimutagenic activity against mutations induced by ethyl methanesulfonate, a direct acting mutagen and alkylating agent, in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100, utilizing the modified Ames test protocol. The dihydro analogue 3 resulting from saturation of the conjugated alkene double bond of 1 was found to exhibit reduced cytotoxicity and enhanced efficacy relative to the parent compound. This result serves preliminarily to exclude a Michael acceptor role of the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl moiety in connection with its antimutagenic activity.",Is plicatin B mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
438,"Erythrosine (diNa, tetraiodofluorescein) was nonmutagenic to the Ames/Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102, and TA104, to a concentration of 2 mg/plate. No mutative intermediates were detected on metabolism by rat caecal cell-free extracts or rat liver S9 mixture; or on incubation with the comutagens, harman and norharman (+/- S9). Instead, an unexpected dose-dependent suppression in spontaneous reversion frequencies was observed (maximum approximately equal to 35% decrease). Erythrosine was antimutagenic to benzo[a]pyrene, but it did not decrease the mutagenicity of the other adduct-forming mutagen, 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide. The food dye was strongly antimutagenic to the bifunctional alkylating agent, mitomycin C, though it did not exhibit a similar effect on the mutagenicity of the corresponding monofunctional agent, methyl methanesulphonate. It partially depressed the mutagenic potentials of sodium azide. The antimutagenic effect of erythrosine on an intercalating agent, ethidium bromide, was discernible only at the highest dose (2 mg/plate). These results have been interpreted in terms of a genointeractive role of erythrosine. Erythrosine produced differential toxic effects in repair-deficient (TA97a, TA98, TA100) and repair-proficient (TA102, TA104) Salmonella tester strains; survival of the repair-deficient strains was found to be decreased. Photoinduced potentiation of erythrosine toxicity was observed, although light irradiation in the presence of erythrosine did not modify the reversion frequencies of the tester strains. The evidence strongly suggests that erythrosine, which exhibits nonmutagenicity in the Ames/Salmonella test, can interact with DNA repair enzymes and/or with DNA.",Is Erythrosine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
439,"In the 1970s it was shown that the monofunctional alkylating agent CB1954 (5-aziridino-2,4-dinitrobenzamide) kills the Walker rat carcinoma 256 in vivo and in vitro, but is inactive against several other tumours. In studies with bacteria, the large differences in survival in DNA-repair-proficient and deficient strains of Escherichia coli B treated with CB1954 were characteristic of a difunctional cross-linking agent. It was concluded that DNA was the only target large enough to receive significantly more than one lethal hit per molecule and that mono-alkylation alone could not account for the lethal effects of CB1954. In 1986 it was shown that CB1954 induced DNA interstrand cross-links in CB1954-sensitive cultured Walker 256 cells, but not in resistant Chinese hamster V79 cells, suggesting that the sensitivity of Walker cells results mainly from their activation of the drug to a difunctional agent by nitroreduction. To test this, we assayed the toxicity and mutagenicity of CB1954 in nitroreductase-plus and -minus strains of E. coli WP2uvrA. Agar-overlay assays showed that CB1954 was mutagenic to several strains of E. coli WP2, in a dose range 1-100 micrograms per plate, with slopes (mutants/nmol) of 7.1, 1.05 and 0.16 for WP2uvrA pKM101, WP2uvrA and WP2. Assays with nitrofurazone showed that these strains possessed nitroreductase activity. However, E. coli NFR-343, a nitrofurazone-resistant mutant of WP2uvrA which lacks nitroreductase activity was markedly less sensitive to the mutagenicity of CB1954, giving a mean slope of 0.12 compared with 1.15 for WP2uvrA. Aroclor-induced rat-liver S9 did not change these responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Is CB1954 mutagenic for pKM101 or WP2uvrA strain?,True
440,"Pyranocoumarins are compounds with an important pharmacological profile, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cytotoxic, antiviral, antibacterial, and hypoglycemic effects. These molecules have a widespread presence as secondary metabolites in medicinal plants used to treat Diabetes Mellitus (DM). The aim of this work was to evaluate antidiabetic activity in Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and the antioxidant effects of 3',4'-Di-O-acetyl-cis-khellactone (DOAcK), as well as its toxic potential. We obtained DOAcK with an enantiomeric excess of 70% by chemical synthesis. Our results showed that this compound exerts an important antidiabetic effect: blood glucose decreased in groups treated with DOAcK by 60.9% at dose of 15mg/kg (p<0.05) compared with the diabetic control group, and demonstrated a statistically significant increase in weight gain (45.7±9.7 in the group treated with DOAcK vs. -23.0±33.1 in the group with diabetes). In a biochemical profile, DOAcK did not modify lipid metabolism and did not cause damage at the renal level. DOAcK administration increased the activities of Catalase (CAT), Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), and Super Oxide Dismutase (SOD) to levels near those of the healthy group. Histopathological analysis exhibited morphology similar to that of the healthy group and the group treated with DOAcK. DOAcK is not mutagenic by Ames test for Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, or TA102, and is not genotoxic by Micronucleus assay; median lethal dose (LD50) >2000mg/kg and, at this dose, no signs of toxicity or death were reported after 14days of observation. These results indicate that DOAcK can improve glucose metabolism, which may be due to the increased antioxidant activity of CAT, GPx and SOD. In addition, DOAcK is not toxic in the studies tested.",Is DOAcK mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
441,"Benomyl (methyl [1-[(butylamino)carbonyl]-1H-benzimidazol-2- yl]carbamate) and its major metabolite carbendazim (methyl 2-benzimidazolecarbamate) are major agricultural systemic fungicides. These compounds inhibit fungal microtubular function and thereby cause nondisjunction of chromosomes at cell division. Several investigators have proposed that these compounds can also cause gene mutations (base-pair substitutions). In this laboratory, no mutagenic activity was observed with either benomyl (analytical grade) or Benlate (samples tested up to 500 and 1200 micrograms/plate, respectively, the limit of cytotoxicity) in the Salmonella/Ames plate-incorporation test in either base-pair substitution (TA100 and TA1535) or frameshift-sensitive (TA98 and TA1537) strains with or without S9 metabolic activation. However, some carbendazim preparations caused mutations in frameshift-sensitive strains at very high concentrations (> or = 5000 micrograms/plate) with metabolic activation. The mutagenic activity was not due to the major carbendazim metabolite, methyl (5-hydroxy-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)carbamate (5-OH MBC), since 5-OH MBC was not mutagenic with (up to 20,000 micrograms/plate) or without (up to 16,000 micrograms/plate) activation. Subsequently, two highly mutagenic contaminants, 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP) and 2-amino-3-hydroxyphenazine (AHP) were detected in mutagenic carbendazim samples. In those samples, DAP and AHP contaminant levels ranged as high as 46.5 and 11.6 ppm, respectively.

447,"Halonitromethanes (HNMs) are a recently identified class of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking water. They include chloronitromethane (CHN), dichloronitromethane (DCNM), trichloronitromethane (TCNM), bromonitromethane (BNM), dibromonitromethane (DBNM), tribromonitromethane (TBNM), bromochloronitromethane (BCNM),dibromochloronitromethane (DBCNM), and bromodichloronitromethane (BDCNM). Previous studies of TCNM, DCNM, CNM, and TBNM found that all four were mutagenic in bacteria, and a recent study showed that all nine induced DNA damage in CHO cells. Here, all nine HNMs were evaluated in the Salmonella plate-incorporation assay +/- S9 using strains TA98, TA100, TA104, TPT100, and the glutathione transferase theta (GSTT1-1)-expressing strain RSJ100. All were mutagenic, most with and without S9. In the absence of S9, six were mutagenic in TA98, six in TA100, and three in TA104; in the presence of S9, these numbers were five, seven, and three, respectively. Thus, the HNMs-induced base substitutions primarily at GC sites as well as frameshifts. Although five HNMs were activated to mutagens in RSJ100 -S9, they produced < or =2-fold increases in revertants and potencies <506 rev/micromol. The rank order of the HNMs by mutagenic potency in TA100 +S9 was (BCNM DBNM) > (TBNM CNM > BNM DCNM BDCNM) > (TCNM = DBCNM). The mean rev/micromol for the three groupings, respectively, were 1423, 498, and 0, which classifies the HNMs as weak mutagens in Salmonella. Reaction of the dihalo and monohalo HNMs with GSH, possibly GSTT1-1, is a possible mechanism for formation of ultimate mutagenic products. Because the HNMs are mutagenic in Salmonella (present study) and potent clastogens in mammalian cells [Environ. Sci. Technol. 38 (2004) 62], their presence in drinking water warrants further research on their potential health effects.",Is BNM mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

The discharging of the three chemicals may endanger the receiving water ecosystem. In the present study, the mutagenicity of BP-6, BP-8, and 4-Methylbenzylidene Camphor was tested using the Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation test (Ames test) in the system with and without rat liver microsomal preparations (S9). Four S.typhimurium strains, TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA102 were employed in the Ames tests. The mutagenicity was detected from all three chemicals. The addition of S9 increased the mutation ratios of three chemicals to four strains, except BP-6 to TA100 strain and 4-MBC to TA97 and TA98 strain. In the mixed experiment, all positive effects were detected in the absence of S9. However, the results all became negative in the presence of S9. For the mixture of BP-6 and 4-MBC, positive results were detected on four tester strains except for the TA100 strain. For the mixture of BP-6, BP-8, and 4-MBC, positive results were detected on four strains.

451,"Benomyl (methyl [1-[(butylamino)carbonyl]-1H-benzimidazol-2- yl]carbamate) and its major metabolite carbendazim (methyl 2-benzimidazolecarbamate) are major agricultural systemic fungicides. These compounds inhibit fungal microtubular function and thereby cause nondisjunction of chromosomes at cell division. Several investigators have proposed that these compounds can also cause gene mutations (base-pair substitutions). In this laboratory, no mutagenic activity was observed with either benomyl (analytical grade) or Benlate (samples tested up to 500 and 1200 micrograms/plate, respectively, the limit of cytotoxicity) in the Salmonella/Ames plate-incorporation test in either base-pair substitution (TA100 and TA1535) or frameshift-sensitive (TA98 and TA1537) strains with or without S9 metabolic activation. However, some carbendazim preparations caused mutations in frameshift-sensitive strains at very high concentrations (> or = 5000 micrograms/plate) with metabolic activation. The mutagenic activity was not due to the major carbendazim metabolite, methyl (5-hydroxy-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)carbamate (5-OH MBC), since 5-OH MBC was not mutagenic with (up to 20,000 micrograms/plate) or without (up to 16,000 micrograms/plate) activation. Subsequently, two highly mutagenic contaminants, 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP) and 2-amino-3-hydroxyphenazine (AHP) were detected in mutagenic carbendazim samples. In those samples, DAP and AHP contaminant levels ranged as high as 46.5 and 11.6 ppm, respectively. No evidence of mutagenicity could be detected in preparations in which the DAP content was < 1.8 ppm. The mutagenic activity of these two contaminants was further investigated in strain TA98. Without activation, DAP and AHP were positive at test concentrations as low as 5 and 10 micrograms/plate, respectively. In the presence of S9, mutations were detected at much lower concentrations (beginning at 0.025 and 0.05 microgram/plate, respectively). These results indicate that carbendazim samples containing DAP or AHP at levels as low as 5 or 10 ppm, respectively, would be positive in the Salmonella/Ames test with activation when tested at 5000 micrograms/plate.

453,"A series of naturally occurring compounds were tested for the ability to modulate the mutagenicity induced by cigarette smoke (CS), cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) and benzo[a]pyrene (BP) in the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay and the micronucleus test in mouse bone marrow. Sodium selenite, retinol acetate and alpha-tocopherol significantly decreased the mutagenic activity of CS in Salmonella typhimurium TA98. Ascorbic acid, reduced glutathione (GSH), cysteine, caffeine, theophylline, cobalt chloride, folic acid, adenine, adenosine, guanosine, cytidine and cytosine were conversely devoid of any significant effect. Sodium selenite slightly decreased the mutagenic activity of CSC in the same bacterial strain, while caffeine was ineffective and ascorbic acid potentiated its mutagenicity. Ascorbic acid inhibited the mutagenic activity of BP in S. typhimurium TA98, but not in TA100. Retinol acetate diminished the number of BP-induced his+ revertants in TA98 but only at the highest concentrations used, whereas alpha-tocopherol, GSH, cysteine, sodium selenite and caffeine had no effect. Selenite and GSH, which were ineffective when applied individually, inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the BP-induced mutagenesis in S. typhimurium TA98 when simultaneously added to the top agar. All other combinations tested, including selenite plus either GSH, cysteine or caffeine towards CS or CSC, or selenite plus cysteine, or selenite plus retinol acetate and alpha-tocopherol towards BP, failed to produce interactive effects.

454,"Five aromatic nitroso compounds were prepared and their mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 compared with that of the corresponding hydroxylamines and the previously studied nitroarenes. A remarkable correspondence of the dose-response curves was observed between the nitroso and the respective hydroxylamine compounds. This effect could be observed in TA98 and TA100. It was only marginally dependent on the metabolical activation by rat liver S9-mix. Even the presence of a bulky alkyl substituent either near to the functional group, or far away from it, previously shown to considerably influence the mutagenic properties of nitroarenes, does not remarkably affect the properties of the nitroso and hydroxylamine species. The similarity between the latter two is likely to be due to a fast reduction of the nitrosoarenes to the hydroxylamine species under the test conditions. It seems that enzymes are not responsible for that reduction step, because sterical crowding near the functional group does not influence that behaviour. The test results of the aromatic hydroxylamines bearing a bulky substituent show that there are at least two ways to influence the mutagenicity of an aromatic nitro compound by such a group. A substituent near the functional group (ortho-position) disturbs the enzymatic reduction of the nitro group, because 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxylaminobiphenyl and its corresponding nitroso compound are highly mutagenic, whereas 3-tert-butyl-4-nitrobiphenyl was previously shown to be inactive even after addition of S9-mix. In contrast, 4'-tert-butyl-4-hydroxylaminobiphenyl with the tert-butyl group ""far away"" from the hydroxylamino functionality clearly shows decreased mutagenic activity suggesting a different influence of a substituent in that position. In addition, the substance shows only little cell toxicity even at higher concentrations. Both effects could be due to a reduced effective dose of the hydroxylamine in the cells compared to the non-alkylated compound, caused by a faster degradation of the hydroxylamine or a hindered interaction between that substance and the cells.",Is 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxylaminobiphenyl mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
455,"Of the three isomeric forms of aminobiphenyl, only 4-aminobiphenyl is an established carcinogen while the 2-isomer is considered as a non-carcinogen and 3-aminobiphenyl is at best described as a weak carcinogen. In the present studies we investigated the mutagenicity of these three compounds, their N-hydroxy derivatives and their nitrosoderivatives in the Ames test using the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. The studies were performed both in the absence and presence of an activation system derived from the liver of rats pretreated with Aroclor 1254. Of the three isomers only 4-aminobiphenyl exhibited mutagenicity and only in the presence of an activation system. N-Hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl was a potent direct mutagen in both bacterial strains, N-hydroxy-2-aminobiphenyl was mutagenic in only TA100 while N-hydroxy-3-aminobiphenyl displayed mutagenicity in neither strain. Both 2- and 3-nitrosobiphenyls were direct mutagens in strain TA100. These findings suggest that the weak carcinogenicity of 3-aminobiphenyl may be attributed to the lack of genotoxicity of its N-hydroxyderivative, whereas in the case of 2-aminobiphenyl it may be due to the inability of the hepatic preparations to catalyse its N-hydroxylation, which is in agreement with published in vivo metabolic studies. It is interesting that of the three isomers only 2-aminobiphenyl is non-planar, forming a dihedral angle of 40 degrees, and this may preclude it from acting as a substrate of the P-450I family of haemoproteins, which selectively catalyses the N-hydroxylation of many aromatic amines including 4-aminobiphenyl.",Is N-Hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

460,"This study used a cell/microbe co-incubation assay to evaluate the effect of four organophosphorus insecticides (parathion-methyl, azinphos-methyl, omethoate, and methamidophos) metabolized by coriander (Coriandrum sativum). The reverse mutation of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 was used as an indicator of genetic damage. Treatments with these insecticides inhibited peroxidase activity in plant cells by between 17% (omethoate) and 98% (azinphos-methyl) and decreased plant protein content by between 36% (omethoate) and 99.6% (azinphos-methyl). Azinphos-methyl was the most toxic when applied directly. In the Ames test, treatments applied directly to strain TA100 killed the bacteria; however, the presence of plant metabolism detoxified the system and permitted the growth of bacteria. In strain TA98, plant metabolites of insecticides were mutagenic. This result suggests that the tested pesticides produce mutations through frameshifting. The same pesticides were applied to human skin (HaCaT) and lung (NL-20) cell lines to evaluate their effects on cell viability. Pesticides applied directly were more cytotoxic than the combination of pesticide plus coriander metabolic fraction. Omethoate and methamidophos did not affect the viability of HaCaT cells, but azinphos-methyl and parathion-methyl at 100 and 1000μgmL(-1) significantly decreased viability (p<0.05). The NL-20 cell line was remarkably sensitive to the direct application of insecticides. All of the treatment conditions caused decreases in NL-20 cell viability (e.g., viability decreased to 12.0% after parathion-methyl treatment, to 14.7% after azinphos-methyl treatment, and to 6.9% after omethoate treatment). Similar to the Ames test, all of the insecticides showed decreased toxicity in human cells when they were cultured in the presence of plant metabolism. In conclusion, when the studied organophosphorus insecticides were plant-metabolized, they induced mutations in the bacterial strain TA98. In human cell lines, plant metabolism reduced the cytotoxic properties of the insecticides, and human keratinocytes were more resistant to mortality than bronchial cells.

Since HACs are known as possible colon and liver cancer inducers, C. lechleri essential oil was tested for its cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative capacity against LoVo and HepG2 cancer cell lines showing IC50 of 74.95±0.05 μg/ml (LoVo) and 82.28±0.03 μg/ml (HepG2), displaying a promising role of this essential oil as a functional food ingredient with interesting mutagen preventing properties.",Is MeIQx mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
463,"Sulforaphane, a constituent of broccoli was investigated for its antimutagenic potential against different classes of cooked food mutagens (heterocyclic amines). These include imidazoazaarenes such as 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP); pyridoindole derivatives such as 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2); and, dipyridoimidazole derivative such as 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1). Tests were carried out by Ames Salmonella/reversion assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 (frame shift mutation sensitive) and TA100 (base pair mutation sensitive) bacterial strains in the presence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver S9. Results of these in vitro antimutagenicity studies strongly suggest that sulforaphane is a potent inhibitor of the mutagenicity induced by imidazoazaarenes such as IQ, MeIQ and MeIQx (approximately 60% inhibition) and moderately active against pyridoindole derivatives such as Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 (32-48% inhibition), but ineffective against dipyridoimidazole derivative (Glu-P-1) in TA 100.",Is MeIQx mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
464,"Anti-mutagenic and anti-carcinogenic effects of beer on heterocyclic amine (HCA)-induced carcinogenesis were studied in vitro and in vivo. Four commercial beers (two pilsner-type, black, and stout) showed inhibitory effects against five HCAs, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1) and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]-quinoline (IQ), in the Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of rat S9 mix. The inhibitory effects of dark-colored beers (stout and black beer) were greater than those of pilsner-type beers. Dark-colored beers suppressed CYP1A2 activity in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that inhibition of HCA activation is partly responsible for their strong anti-mutagenic effects. Anti-mutagenic effects were also observed when the pooled human S9 mix or activated IQ was used in the assay. The micronucleus test using Chinese hamster lung CHL/IU cells showed that the addition of freeze-dried samples of pilsner-type and stout beer to the culture medium significantly reduced the number of cells with micronuclei induced with PhIP or Trp-P-2. Single-cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay) revealed that oral ingestion of pilsner-type and stout beers for 1 week significantly inhibited DNA damage in the liver cells of male ICR mice exposed to MeIQx (13 mg/kg, i.p.). A decrease in the formation of DNA adducts was also observed using a 32P-postlabeling method. Male Fischer 344 rats orally received PhIP (75 mg/kg, five times a week for 2 weeks) and aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation in the colon was analyzed after 5 weeks. The number of ACF was significantly reduced in rats fed a diet containing freeze-dried beer. These results suggest that beer inhibits the genotoxic effects of HCAs and may reduce the risk of carcinogenesis caused by food borne carcinogens.",Is MeIQx mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
465,"Dibenzoylmethane (DBM), a structural analogue of curcumin (a bioactive phytochemical present in a widely used spice turmeric) was screened for its inhibitory effect against seven cooked food mutagens (heterocyclic amines): 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1), in both TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium using Ames Salmonella/reversion assay in the presence of Aroclor1254-induced rat liver S9 homogenate. DBM has been reported to antagonize the mutagenicity of several chemical carcinogens in vitro and has recently been shown to be even more effective than curcumin in suppressing the 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumors in rats. But there are no reports regarding its antimutagenic properties against cooked food mutagens. Results of the present investigations clearly indicate that dibenzoylmethane is a very potent antimutagenic agent, that could effectively inhibit mutagenicity induced by all the tested cooked food mutagens in both the frame shift (TA98) as well as the base pair mutation sensitive (TA100) strains of S. typhimurium. These highly potent inhibitory effects of dibenzoylmethane against heterocyclic amines observed in our preliminary investigations strongly warrant further studies of its efficacy as a cancer chemopreventive agent.",Is Dibenzoylmethane mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
466,"Curcumin (C) and its natural analogues demethoxycurcumin (dmC) and bisdemethoxycurcumin (bdmC), known for their potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic effects, were tested for their possible inhibitory effects against seven cooked food mutagens (heterocyclic amines): 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1), in both TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium using Ames Salmonella/reversion assay in the presence of Aroclor induced rat liver S9 homogenate. In the present investigations, curcumin as well as its two natural analogues i.e., dmC and bdmC were found to be highly effective in suppressing genotoxicity of all the tested cooked food mutagens in a dose-dependent manner, in both the frame shift (TA98) as well as base pair mutation sensitive (TA100) strains of S. typhimurium. However, bdmC appeared to be a relatively less active antimutagen compared to C and dmC. More than 80% inhibition of mutagenicity was observed at 200 microg/plate in case of C and dmC in both TA98 and TA100 against all tested cooked food mutagens. Where as, bdmC showed 39-79% inhibition in TA100 and 60-80% inhibition in TA98, at a dose of 200 microg/plate. These findings warrant further biochemical, enzymatic and in vivo investigations in animal models as well as in humans to establish the chemoprotective effect of these agents against mutagenic heterocyclic amines found in cooked food.",Is demethoxycurcumin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
467,"MeIQx, a potent bacterial mutagen formed when meat is cooked, requires metabolic activation to exert its genotoxicity, a reaction catalysed primarily by CYP1A2 in adult mammals. Little is known about mammalian developmental changes in the mutagneic activation of compounds such as MeIQx. In rabbits we have shown previously that expression of CYP1A2 increases with age and is inducible by 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) from as early as 4 days pre-parturition. We have therefore investigated the effect of age on rabbit liver activation of MeIQx (assessed in an Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA98) before and after treatment of the animals with MC. MeIQx activation could not be detected using hepatic microsomal fractions from rabbits of <17 days of age. Thereafter activation increased with age to peak in weanling animals. Following MC treatment MeIQx activation was increased, being detectable in samples from rabbits as young as 9-11 days. The inducibility of MeIQx activation increased with age, reaching a plateau between 17 and 35 days. These rates of activation were broadly parallel to the changes in CYP1A2 specific content. These results indicate that the ability of rabbit liver to activate MeIQx is dependent on CYP1A2 activity, the expression of which is developmentally regulated. Although it has been established that human activation of MeIQx is also CYP1A2 dependent, whether a similar situation exists in infant humans has yet to be determined, although there is evidence that CYP1A2-dependent activity reaches a peak in late childhood.",Is MeIQx mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
468,"The influence of dietary caffeine on the genotoxicity of the cooked food mutagen 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]-quinoxaline (MeIQx) was evaluated using the host-mediated assay in mice. For four weeks, BALB/c mice were fed a purified diet with or without caffeine (0.01% wt/wt in the diet). In the host-mediated assay, Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was given intravenously immediately before an oral dose of MeIQx (1.5 mg/kg body wt). After one hour, the mice were killed, the Salmonellae were recovered from the liver, and the number of mutants (his+ revertants) were determined. Consumption of caffeine led to a 47% reduction in the number of mutants induced by MeIQx (p < 0.001). Subsequent in vitro experiments using S. typhimurium TA98 revealed that the capacity of hepatic S-9 fractions from the caffeine-fed mice to covert MeIQx to an active mutagen was reduced by approximately 35%. This effect was not attributable to caffeine in the S-9 preparation. These data suggest that consumption of caffeine modifies MeIQx mutagenicity by altering the spectrum of enzymes involved in its activation.",Is caffeine mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
469,"The mutagenic activity of 15 different mono-, di-, tri-, and tetramethyl derivatives of the food mutagen IQx (2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline), one diphenyl derivative of IQx and two phenyl derivatives of 5-MeIQx (2-amino-3,5-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline) were studied in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and enzymatic activation (S9). The number and positioning of the methyl groups strongly affected the mutagenic activity. The phenylated compounds showed weak mutagenic potency. It seems that both resonance stabilization of the nitrenium ion and steric effects are important in determining mutagenic potency.",Is phenyl derivatives of 5-MeIQx mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
470,"The effect of arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid on the conversion of the heterocyclic amine 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) to its genotoxic metabolites was investigated using a modified bacterial mutation assay. The assay used Salmonella typhimurium TA98 as an indicator of the mutagenicity and hepatic post-mitochondrial fractions (S-9) from male Sprague-Dawley rats as the activating system. All three fatty acids inhibited the mutagenicity of IQ without effect on the uptake of the active metabolites and/or on the DNA repair processes within the bacterial cell. The activation of three other food mutagens, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was also inhibited by these fatty acids.",Is arachidonic acid mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False

472,"The umu test system is a newly developed method to evaluate genotoxic activities of a wide variety of environmental carcinogens and mutagens (Oda et al., 1985). In the present study, we further examined the abilities of 151 chemicals to induce umu gene expression in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. Among the chemicals examined, 72 compounds induced umu gene expression, which could be defined on a basis of increased beta-galactosidase activity by 2-fold over the background level. The potent genotoxic compounds without metabolic activation were adriamycin, bleomycin, daunorubicin, 1,3-dinitropyrene, 1,6-dinitropyrene, 1,8-dinitropyrene, N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, furylfuramide, methyl methanesulfonate, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, mitomycin C, 1-nitropyrene and 4-nitroquino-line-1-oxide. In the presence of S9, aflatoxin B1, 2-aminoanthracene, Glu-P-1, IQ, MeIQ, MeIQx, Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 also induced umu gene expression markedly. Several chemicals such as 2-acetylaminofluorene, 9-aminoacridine, azobenzene, benzanthracene, benzidine, diethyl nitrosamine, 1-nitronaphthalene, paraquat, potassium dichromate and sodium nitrite were weakly genotoxic and the induction by these compounds could be detected only when the incubation time was prolonged from 2 h to 5 h. Data are also presented that some of the chemicals such as dimethyl sulfoxide, m-dioxan, 5-fluorouracil and paraquat, which have been reported to be non-mutagenic in Ames/Salmonella assay, were found to be active in inducing umu gene expression, while the known mutagenic compounds including acrylonitrile, 4,4'-dinitrobiphenyl, furfural, methylene chloride, 1-naphthylamine, sodium azide, o-tolidine and o-toluidine were non-genotoxic in the present assay system.",Is MeIQx mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True

These measurements were made using a bacterial mutation assay with hepatic fractions from either SWR mice or DSN Syrian hamsters as the activating system and Salmonella typhimurium TA98 as the indicator organism. Although histamine had very little effect on the genotoxicity of these mutagens, the other amines reduced genotoxicity, with tryptamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine exerting the greatest effect. Generally the amines exhibited greater potency when S-9 fractions from mice rather than from hamsters were used.",Is MeIQx mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

The pyrolyzates are potent mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines formed during cooking. Solution of these amines was mixed with aqueous suspension of bacterial cells or dietary fibers, and removal of these amines from the reaction mixture by centrifugation was defined as the binding. Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 were effectively bound to all gram-positive and some gram-negative bacterial cells, corn bran, apple pulp, and soy bean fiber. Binding of Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and cellulose was moderate, and to chitin and chitosan it was little. None but corn bran bound Glu-P-1 and Glu-P-2 effectively. Corn bran effectively bound all mutagens tested. The quantity of the binding of IQ, MeIQ, and MeIQx was dependent on the strain of bacteria and the kind of fiber. The mechanism of binding of Trp-P-2 to freeze-dried feces, Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC9018), and corn bran was investigated. The binding was pH dependent, occurred instantaneously, and was inhibited by the addition of metal salts. These results indicate that the binding was mostly due to a cation-exchange mechanism, but some irreversible binding of Trp-P-2 was observed, most notably to freeze-dried feces. The mutagenicity of Trp-P-2 for Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of S9 mix was inhibited by the addition of LC9018 or corn bran to the reaction mixture. The results indicate that bound Trp-P-2 did not cause mutation under the assay conditions.",Is pyrolyzates mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

Only the first-mentioned compound was active in Ames test; the response was equal for Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100, regardless of enzymatic activation (S9). However, its mutagenicity to TA98 + S9 was 300-1300 times smaller than the values reported for the related compounds, 3-methyl- and 3,4-dimethyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinolin-2-amine ('IQ' and 'MeIQ'), and for 3,8-dimethyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxalin-2-amine ('MeIQx').

The products were purified and characterized by mass spectrometry and [1H] nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The mutagenic activities of the chlorinated benzidines were determined, using the Ames tester strain TA98. 3,5,3'-Trichlorobenzidine is the most potent benzidine derivative yet reported.

478,"The ability of fluoroquinolones to cause light-induced adverse effects has been established in experimental studies and clinical observations. The formation of active oxygen species appears to be responsible for this activity. Photomutagenicity tests with bacterial, lower eukaryotic and mammalian cells were performed with three fluoroquinolones (Fleroxacin, Ciprofloxacin and Lomefloxacin). After concomitant irradiation with simulated solar light (with a reduced UVB component), weak increases in the number of revertants were observed in Salmonella typhimurium TA104 and TA100. No photomutagenic activity was detected in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7. In the chromosomal aberration (CA) test with Chinese hamster V79 cells the number of aberrant metaphases was markedly increased. In the Comet assay with mouse lymphoma cells, evidence of extensive DNA breakage was obtained. All three compounds showed similar potencies in the Comet and Ames assays while there was a clear gradation of potencies in the CA assay (Lomefloxacin > Fleroxacin > Ciprofloxacin), which conformed with reports on the relative potencies regarding phototoxicity. The oxygen radical scavengers catalase, superoxide dismutase and N, N'-dimethylurea modulated the photoclastogenicity and phototoxicity but had no influence on the effects in the Comet and Ames tests. It thus appears that different kinds of mechanism are responsible for toxicity and clastogenicity on the one side and DNA breakage and gene mutation on the other side. Pre-irradiation of the test articles did not lead to enhanced genotoxicity, indicating the involvement of very short lived genotoxic agents. The results endorse the advice to avoid excessive light exposure during antibiotic therapy with fluoroquinolones.",Is Lomefloxacin mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
479,"The mutagenic and antimutagenic effects of linalool, linalyl acetate and beta-caryophyllene were evaluated by the bacterial reverse mutation assay on Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100, and on Escherichia coli WP2uvrA strains. Neither linalool nor beta-caryophyllene showed mutagenicity, but linalyl acetate induced a statistically significant increase in the number of revertant colonies in WP2uvrA, both with and without S9 mixture. Linalool was devoid of antimutagenic activity against 2-nitrofluorene (2NF), sodium azide (SA), methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) and 2-aminoanthracene (2AA). In contrast, beta-caryophyllene showed a strong antimutagenic activity against 2NF: at the maximum concentration tested (6.40mg/plate) the number of 2NF-induced revertant colonies was reduced by 83.9%. beta-Caryophyllene also showed to counteract the mutagenicity of SA (in TA 100), MMS and 2AA (in WP2uvrA): the effect was weak against SA (inhibition lower than 25%) and moderate against MMS and 2AA (up to 30.5%). The antimutagenic activity of beta-caryophyllene observed here suggests further studies to evaluate its possible chemopreventive properties.",Is beta-Caryophyllene mutagenic for WP2uvrA strain?,False
480,"Although many studies have reported that nitroaromatics such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) have strong mutagenicity, the mechanism of mutagenic activity in these compounds has not yet been reported. We examined the mutagenicity versus reactivity and biodegradation by bacteria using TNT and its analogs (1,3,5-trinitrobenzene [TNB], 2,4,6-trinitroaniline [TNA], 2,4,6-trinitro-phenol [TNP], N,2,4,6-tetranitro-N-methyl-aniline [tetryl], 2,4-dinitrotoluene [24DNT], and 2,6-dinitrotoluene [26DNT]). Aromatic compounds harboring three nitro groups (except TNP) have high mutagenicity, judging from the results of the umu test using luminescent bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535/pTL210). Single-electron reduction potentials for these chemicals were -530, -555, -565, -575, -640, -674, and -764 mV for TNA, tetyl, TNT, TNB, 24DNT, 26DNT, and TNP, respectively, indicating that trinitro-aromatics (except TNP) were more reducible than other compounds. Pseudomonas sp. strain TM15, which was isolated from TNT-contaminated soils in the Yamada Green Zone, Kitakyushu City, Japan, could efficiently biotransform TNT, TNB, TNA, and tetryl; 24DNT, 26DNT, and TNP were less biodegradable. This strain converted all TNT analogs into reduction products; nitro groups were reduced to amino groups. We revealed that the mutagenicity of nitroaromatics correlate with reactivity and biodegradability. This finding may contribute to the elucidation of mutagenic expression of nitroaromatic compounds in organisms.",Is TNT mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
481,"Recognition of the occupational hazards from exposure to the propellants hydrazine and monomethylhydrazine (MMH) has led to research into less toxic alternatives. Two hypergolic compounds, dimethylamino-2-ethylazide (DMAZ) and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethanediamine (TMEDA), have been identified as possible replacements for MMH. We have obtained genotoxicity data for these compounds from in vitro and in vivo studies. DMAZ did not produce any mutagenic effects at concentrations up to 5mg/plate in the TA98 and TA1537 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in an Escherichia coli (WP2 uvrA) strain, with or without metabolic activation, but did produce a positive response in the TA100 and TA1535 strains, both with and without metabolic activation. TMEDA was found not to be mutagenic in any of the bacterial strains tested (Salmonella TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and E. coli, WP2 uvrA), with or without metabolic activation. DMAZ did not induce structural chromosomal aberrations at levels up to 5mg/mL in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, with or without metabolic activation. TMEDA produced a positive response in this system, with or without metabolic activation, but only at the highest concentration, 5mg/mL. However, according to the OECD guideline TG 473, the compound is considered to be negative in the CHO chromosomal aberration assay, since the compound was not clastogenic at 0.01M (1.140mg/mL). DMAZ and TMEDA, when tested in vivo in the CD-1 mouse at doses up to 500 and 250mg/kg, respectively, did not induce micronuclei in bone marrow erythrocytes. These studies demonstrate that DMAZ is mutagenic in specific strains of Salmonella. However, both compounds were negative for induction of chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells in vitro and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.",Is TMEDA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
482,"1-Hydroxymethylpyrene (HMP), a primary benzylic alcohol, and 4H-cyclopenta[def]chrysen-4-ol (OH-CPC), a secondary benzylic alcohol, were investigated for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium (reversion of the his- strain TA98) in the presence of various xenobiotic-metabolizing systems. In the direct test, HMP was inactive and OH-CPC was very weakly active. In the presence of NADPH-fortified postmitochondrial fraction from rat liver (S9/NADPH), no activation of OH-CPC was observed, whereas strong mutagenic effects were elicited by HMP. In the presence of cytosol and 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), both alcohols were activated to potent mutagens. For equal mutagenic effects, approximately 650-fold lower concentrations of HMP were required in the cytosol/PAPS-mediated assay than in the S9/NADPH-mediated assay. The cytosol/PAPS-mediated mutagenicity of both alcohols was 3- to 4-fold enhanced, when KCl (125 mM) was present during the exposure. The authentic chloromethylarenes, 1-chloromethylpyrene and 4-chloro-4H-cyclopenta[def]chrysene, showed very strong direct mutagenicity. These results, taken together with previous findings, indicate that both primary and secondary benzylic alcohols derived from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may be activated by sulfotransferases to electrophilic sulfuric acid esters, and by subsequent substitution reaction to further active species such as benzylic chlorides.",Is 1-Hydroxymethylpyrene mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
483,"Methyl trans-styryl ketone is used as a synthetic flavoring agent and a fragrance additive in food and personal care products. Methyl trans-styryl ketone was nominated for study by the National Cancer Institute due to widespread human exposure as a flavoring and fragrance additive, positive results in the Ames/Salmonella assay and the mouse lymphoma L5178Y/tk+/- assay, and as a representative of the α,β-unsaturated ketone chemical class. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice received methyl trans-styryl ketone (98.6% pure) in feed for 3 months and dermally for 3 months or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. Two-year studies were conducted to provide data for assessment of possible toxicity due to exposure to methyl trans-styryl ketone. The dermal route was chosen since this is the route for highest human exposure and due to studies demonstrating systemic exposure following dermal application to methyl trans-styryl ketone.   3-MONTH FEED STUDY IN RATS Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were fed diets containing 0%, 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, or 0.4% methyl trans-styryl ketone (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 18, 36, 72, 145, or 290 mg methyl trans-styryl ketone/kg body weight to males and 19, 38, 77, 150, or 300 mg/kg to females) for 14 weeks. Groups of 10 male and 10 female clinical pathology rats were fed the same concentrations for 24 days. All core study rats survived to the end of the study. Final mean body weights of males and females receiving 0.4% and mean body weight gains of males receiving 0.4% were significantly less than those of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed groups was similar to that by the controls. Clinical findings included diarrhea and hyperactivity in males and females. Results of sperm motility and vaginal cytology evaluations indicated methyl trans-styryl ketone is unlikely to be a reproductive toxicant in male rats; however, it exhibits potential for reproductive toxicity in female rats based upon an increased probability of extended diestrus at the highest exposure concentration. In all exposed groups of males, there were treatment-related increased incidences of goblet cell hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium of the nose and nephropathy of the kidney. In females, there was an increased incidence of goblet cell hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium of the nose in the group receiving 0.4%.  3-MONTH FEED STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were fed diets containing 0%, 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, or 0.4% methyl trans-styryl ketone (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 55, 110, 220, 400, or 750 mg/kg to males and 50, 100, 200, 350, or 600 mg/kg to females) for 14 weeks. One male receiving 0.2% and one control female died before the end of the study. Mean body weights of males and females receiving 0.4% were significantly less than those of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed groups was similar to that by the controls. Hyperactivity in both sexes was the only clinical finding. Results of sperm motility and vaginal cytology evaluations indicated methyl trans-styryl ketone is unlikely to be a reproductive toxicant in male mice; however, it exhibits potential for reproductive toxicity in female mice based upon an increased probability of extended diestrus at the lowest and the highest exposure concentrations.

Groups of 10 male and 10 female clinical pathology rats were administered the same doses for 23 days. All rats survived to the end of the study. Mean body weights of 175 and 350 mg/kg males were significantly less than that of the vehicle controls. Clinical findings in groups administered 175 or 350 mg/kg included dermal irritation, thickened skin, and ulceration at the site of application. Results of sperm motility and vaginal cytology evaluations indicated methyl trans-styryl ketone is unlikely to be a reproductive toxicant in male or female rats at the doses used in this study. Histologically, there were significantly increased incidences of epidermal hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, chronic active inflammation, epidermal necrosis, and sebaceous gland hypertrophy in the skin at the site of application in males and/or females.

All mice in the 700 and 1,400 mg/kg groups were sacrificed moribund before the end of the study. The final mean body weights of surviving groups of dosed males and females were similar to those of the vehicle controls; however, the mean body weight gains of the 175 mg/kg groups were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls. Clinical findings at the site of application included dermal irritation in 350 mg/kg males and crust formation in all 700 and 1,400 mg/kg mice except one female. Results of sperm motility and vaginal cytology evaluations indicated methyl trans-styryl ketone is unlikely to be a reproductive toxicant in male or female mice at the doses used in this study. There were treatment-related increased incidences of epidermal hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, chronic active inflammation, epidermal necrosis, sebaceous gland hypertrophy, and hair follicle hyperplasia in the skin at the site of application in males and females.

484,"The mutagenic activity of four antiphytoviral substances was tested in reversion mutagenicity assays with a set of histidine auxotrophic strains of Salmonella typhimurium by means of the preincubation method. A possible metabolic activation of the substances by cell free fractions from maize seedlings (S-14-fraction) and for comparison from mouse liver (S-9 mix) was examined. None of the guanidine, phenyl urea and thiadiazole compounds exerted mutagenic activity in the bacterial strains in experiments without metabolic activation. Cyanoguanidine and N-phenyl-N-carboxyphenylurea became mutagenic for Salmonella strain TA98 after metabolic activation by the S-14 plant fraction. Both substances were not mutagenic in the presence of S-9 mix made from mouse liver.

489,"The combination of chemical analyses and bioassays allows the identification of potentially mutagenic compounds in different types of samples. Dyes can be considered as emergent contaminants and were detected in waters, under the influence of textile activities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of 9 azo dyes to the mutagenicity of representative environmental samples. Samples were collected along one year in the largest conglomerate of textile industries of Brazil. We analyzed water samples from an important water body, Piracicaba River, upstream and downstream two main discharges, the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the tributary Quilombo River, which receives untreated effluent from local industries. Samples were analyzed using a LC-MS/MS and tested for mutagenicity in the Salmonella/microsome microsuspension assay with TA98 and YG1041. Six dyes were detected in the collected samples, Disperse Blue 291, Disperse Blue 373, Disperse Orange 30, Disperse Red 1, Disperse Violet 93, and Disperse Yellow 3. The most sensitive condition for the detection of the mutagenicity was the strain YG1041 with S9. The concentration of dyes and mutagenicity levels varied along time and the dry season represented the worst condition. Disperse Blue 373 and Disperse Violet 93 were the major contributors to the mutagenicity. We conclude that dyes are contributing for the mutagenicity of Piracicaba River water; and both discharges, WWTP effluent and Quilombo River, increase the mutagenicity of Piracicaba River waters in about 10-fold. The combination of chemical analysis and bioassays were key in the identification the main drivers of the water mutagenicity and allows the selection of priority compounds to be included in monitoring programs as well for the enforcing actions required to protect the water quality for multiple uses.",Is Disperse Orange mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
490,"Azo dyes constitute the largest group of colorants used in industry and can pass through municipal waste water plants nearly unchanged due to their resistance to aerobic treatment, which potentially exposes humans and local biota to adverse effects. Unfortunately, little is known about their environmental fate. Under anaerobic conditions, some azo dyes are cleaved by microorganisms forming potentially carcinogenic aromatic amines. In the present study, the azo dye Disperse Orange 1, widely used in textile dyeing, was tested using the comet, Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity, cell viability, Daphnia similis and Microtox(®) assays. The human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) was used in the comet assay and for cell viability. In the mutagenicity assay, Salmonella typhimurium strains with different levels of nitroreductase and o-acetyltransferase were used. The dye showed genotoxic effects with respect to HepG2 cells at concentrations of 0.2, 0.4, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0μg/mL. In the mutagenicity assay, greater responses were obtained with the strains TA98 and YG1041, suggesting that this compound mainly induces frameshift mutations. Moreover, the mutagenicity was greatly enhanced with the strains overproducing nitroreductase and o-acetyltransferase, showing the importance of these enzymes in the mutagenicity of this dye. In addition, the compound induced apoptosis after 72h in contact with the HepG2 cells. No toxic effects were observed for either D. similis or Vibrio fischeri.",Is Disperse Orange mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
491,"Recently a textile azo dye processing plant effluent was identified as one of the sources of mutagenic activity detected in the Cristais River, a drinking water source in Brazil [G.A.

Claxton, Investigating the sources of the mutagenic activity found in a river using the Salmonella assay and different water extraction procedures, Chemosphere 54 (2004) 1589-1597]. Besides presenting high mutagenic activity in the Salmonella/microsome assay, the mutagenic nitro-aminoazobenzenes dyes CI Disperse Blue 373, CI Disperse Violet 93, and CI Disperse Orange 37 [G.A. Umbuzeiro, H.S. Freeman, S.H. Warren, D.P. Oliveira, Y. Terao, T. Watanabe, L.D. Claxton, The contribution of azo dyes in the mutagenic activity of the Cristais river, Chemosphere 60 (2005) 55-64] as well as benzidine, a known carcinogenic compound [T.M. Mazzo, A.A. Saczk, G.A. Umbuzeiro, M.V.B. Zanoni, Analysis of aromatic amines in surface waters receiving wastewater from textile industry by liquid chromatographic with eletrochemical detection, Anal. Lett., in press] were found in this effluent. After approximately 6 km from the discharge of this effluent, a drinking water treatment plant treats and distributes the water to a population of approximate 60,000. As shown previously, the mutagens in the DWTP intake water are not completely removed by the treatment. The water used for human consumption presented mutagenic activity related to nitro-aromatics and aromatic amines compounds probably derived from the cited textile processing plant effluent discharge [G.A. Umbuzeiro, D.A. Roubicek, C.M. Rech, M.I.Z. Sato, L.D. Claxton, Investigating the sources of the mutagenic activity found in a river using the Salmonella assay and different water extraction procedures, Chemosphere 54 (2004) 1589-1597; G.A.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate the possible risks involved in the human consumption of this contaminated water. With that objective, one sample of the cited industrial effluent was tested for carcinogenicity in the aberrant crypt foci medium-term assay in colon of Wistar rats. The rats received the effluent in natura through drinking water at concentrations of 0.1%, 1%, and 10%. The effluent mutagenicity was also confirmed in the Salmonella/microsome assay with the strains TA98 and YG1041. There was an increased number of preneoplastic lesions in the colon of rats exposed to concentrations of 1% and 10% of the effluent, and a positive response for both Salmonella strains tested. These results indicate that the discharge of the effluent should be avoided in waters used for human consumption and show the sensitivity of the ACF crypt foci assay as an important tool to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of environmental complex mixtures.",Is Disperse Orange mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
492,"The halocarbon BCF was tested in 3 assays to assess its mutagenicity and clastogenicity. It produced a positive response in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535 but was negative in TA1537, TA1538, TA98 and TA100. In an L5178Y mouse lymphoma microwell assay (TK locus), BCF was negative. BCF was administered at 5000 and 50 000 ppm in air for 6 h to groups of C57B1/6J mice of both sexes. Animals were killed at 24, 48 and 72 h after cessation of exposure and the incidence of bone marrow micronuclei per 1000 PCEs determined. There was no significant difference in the incidences of micronuclei between untreated animals and those exposed to either concentration of BCF at any of the sampling times. These results suggest that BCF is mutagenic in vitro in only one strain of Salmonella; in mammalian cells the compound induced no gene mutation in vitro nor clastogenic activity in vivo at doses that also produced clear evidence of toxicity.",Is BCF mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
493,"Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of rotenone (more than 98% pure), a pesticide, were conducted in B6C3F1 mice and F344/N rats for 14 days, 13 weeks, and 2 years. Results of the Fourteen-Day Studies: In the 14-day studies (dietary rotenone concentrations of 0-600 ppm in the first 14-day studies and 0-4,800 ppm in the second 14-day studies), rough hair coats and dose-related decreases in mean body weight gain were observed in rats. Rats fed diets containing rotenone at concentrations of 1,200 ppm or higher lost weight. No compound-related toxic effects were observed in mice. Results of the Thirteen-Week Studies: In the 13-week studies (concentrations of 0-1,200 ppm rotenone in feed for rats and 0-50,000 ppm for mice), compound-related effects included lower body weight gain in rats at 150 ppm or more; and bone marrow atrophy and inflammation and hyperplasia of the forestomach in male rats at 300 ppm or more and in female rats at 150 ppm or more. These findings were used to establish the dietary concentrations of rotenone for the 2-year studies. Experimental Design for the Two-Year Studies: Two-year studies of rotenone were conducted by administering diets containing 0, 38, or 75 ppm rotenone to groups of 50 F344/N rats of each sex for 103 weeks. Groups of 50 B6C3F1 mice of each sex were administered diets containing 0, 600, or 1,200 ppm rotenone on the same schedule. The estimated average amount of rotenone consumed per day was 1.7 mg/kg or 3.5 mg/kg for low dose or high dose rats and 115 mg/kg or 250 mg/kg for low dose and high dose mice. Survival and Mean Body Weight in the Two-Year Studies: Survival of control and dosed rats was similar (male: control, 22/50; low dose. 31/50; high dose, 30/50; female: control, 27/50; low dose, 32/50; high dose, 31/50). Mean body weights of dosed and control male rats were comparable. Mean body weights of high dose female rats were 5%-9% lower than those of the controls between weeks 58 and 88. Survival of high dose male mice was significantly greater than that of the controls (male: 29/50; 36/50; 47/50; female: 37/50; 42/50; 45/50). Final mean body weights of dosed mice were lower than those of the controls by 8%-13% for males and 17%-24% for females. Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: Parathyroid gland adenomas were observed in 1/41 control, 0/44 low dose, and 4/44 high dose male rats. The historicalincidence of this uncommon tumor in untreated control male rats in NTP studies is 4/1,314 (0.3%). Because these tumors are rare and because the highest incidence ever seen in a control group is 1/50, the increase in these tumors may have been related to rotenone administration. The incidence of subcutaneous tissue fibromas, fibrosarcomas, sarcomas, myxosarcomas, or neurofibrosarcomas (combined) in low dose female rats was greater (P<0.05) than that in the controls (0/50; 5/50; 3/50). These tumors were combined because of their possible common histiogenic origin from fibroblasts or undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. The incidence of those tumors in the low dose females was greater than the historical rats at this laboratory (9/337, 3% +/- 1%) and throughout the Program (50/2,021, 2% +/- 2%). Because of the lack of a significant dose-related trend and because statistical significance was attained only by combining tumors of differing morphology, the subcutaneous tissue tumors in female rats were not considered to be chemically related. The incidences of these tumors in dosed male rats were not significantly different from that in the controls. Hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas (combined) occurred in male mice with a negative (P<0.02) trend, and the incidence in the high dose group was lower than that in the controls (12/47; 12/49; 1/50). Because this low rate of combined liver tumors is unusual, this decrease may have been related to rotenone administration. Subcutaneous tissue fibromas, sarcomas, fibrosarcomas, or neurofibrosarcomas (combined) in male mice occurred with a significant (P<0.05) negative trend (8/49; 4/50; 2/50). The incidence in the high dose group was signignificant (P&lt;0.05) negative trend (8/49; 4/50; 2/50). The incidence in the high dose group was significantly lower than that in the controls by the life table test (P=0.01). Genotoxicity: Rotenone was not mutagenic when tested according to a preincubational protocol with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA98 with or without metabolic activation by rat or hamster liver S9. Rotenone induced forward mutations in the mouse L5178Y/TK&plusmn; lymphoma assay without activation; it was not tested in the presence of S9. Results of tests with rotenone in Chinese hamster ovary cells were negative for induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation (at concentrations at which the chemical was very toxic), equivocal for SCEs in the presence of rat liver S9 (due to a nonrepeatable positive response when tests were conducted up to toxic concentrations), and negative for chromosomal aberrationsin both the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Data Audit: An audit of the experimental data was conducted for the 2-year studies of rotenone. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of rotenone for male F344/N rats, as indicated by an increased incidence of parathyroid gland adenomas (uncommon tumors). There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in female F344/N rats fed diets containing 38 or 75 ppm rotenone. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for male or female B6C3F1 mice fed diets containing 600 or 1,200 ppm rotenone for 2 years. The decreased incidence of liver neoplasms in male mice may have been related to the administration of rotenone.

Survival of high dose male mice was significantly greater than that of the controls (male: 29/50; 36/50; 47/50; female: 37/50; 42/50; 45/50). Final mean body weights of dosed mice were lower than those of the controls by 8%-13% for males and 17%-24% for females. Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: Parathyroid gland adenomas were observed in 1/41 control, 0/44 low dose, and 4/44 high dose male rats. The historicalincidence of this uncommon tumor in untreated control male rats in NTP studies is 4/1,314 (0.3%). Because these tumors are rare and because the highest incidence ever seen in a control group is 1/50, the increase in these tumors may have been related to rotenone administration. The incidence of subcutaneous tissue fibromas, fibrosarcomas, sarcomas, myxosarcomas, or neurofibrosarcomas (combined) in low dose female rats was greater (P<0.05) than that in the controls (0/50; 5/50; 3/50). These tumors were combined because of their possible common histiogenic origin from fibroblasts or undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. The incidence of those tumors in the low dose females was greater than the historical rats at this laboratory (9/337, 3% +/- 1%) and throughout the Program (50/2,021, 2% +/- 2%). Because of the lack of a significant dose-related trend and because statistical significance was attained only by combining tumors of differing morphology, the subcutaneous tissue tumors in female rats were not considered to be chemically related. The incidences of these tumors in dosed male rats were not significantly different from that in the controls. Hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas (combined) occurred in male mice with a negative (P<0.02) trend, and the incidence in the high dose group was lower than that in the controls (12/47; 12/49; 1/50). Because this low rate of combined liver tumors is unusual, this decrease may have been related to rotenone administration. Subcutaneous tissue fibromas, sarcomas, fibrosarcomas, or neurofibrosarcomas (combined) in male mice occurred with a significant (P<0.05) negative trend (8/49; 4/50; 2/50). The incidence in the high dose group was signignificant (P&lt;0.05) negative trend (8/49; 4/50; 2/50). The incidence in the high dose group was significantly lower than that in the controls by the life table test (P=0.01). Genotoxicity: Rotenone was not mutagenic when tested according to a preincubational protocol with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA98 with or without metabolic activation by rat or hamster liver S9. Rotenone induced forward mutations in the mouse L5178Y/TK&plusmn; lymphoma assay without activation; it was not tested in the presence of S9. Results of tests with rotenone in Chinese hamster ovary cells were negative for induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation (at concentrations at which the chemical was very toxic), equivocal for SCEs in the presence of rat liver S9 (due to a nonrepeatable positive response when tests were conducted up to toxic concentrations), and negative for chromosomal aberrationsin both the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Data Audit: An audit of the experimental data was conducted for the 2-year studies of rotenone. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of rotenone for male F344/N rats, as indicated by an increased incidence of parathyroid gland adenomas (uncommon tumors). There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in female F344/N rats fed diets containing 38 or 75 ppm rotenone. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for male or female B6C3F1 mice fed diets containing 600 or 1,200 ppm rotenone for 2 years. The decreased incidence of liver neoplasms in male mice may have been related to the administration of rotenone.

497,"Nitrilotriacetic acid trisodium salt (NTA), which is a substitute for polyphosphates in household laundry detergents, and N-nitrosoiminodiacetic acid (NIDA), a derivative of NTA produced by metabolism of soil microorganisms, were tested for in vitro mutagenicity in bacteria and yeasts. No gene reversions in five strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA 1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98, and TA100), no forward gene mutations in Schizosaccharomyces pombe P1, and no mitotic gene conversions at two loci in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D4 were induced by NTA (up to 870 micrograms/plate or 40 micrograms/ml) and NIDA (up to 2,000 micrograms/plate or 1,000 micrograms/ml), independently of the presence of rat liver metabolic activation. The influence of NTA on the mutagenic and clastogenic activity of several chromium compounds was examined in the Salmonella/microsome assay and in the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assay in mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster ovary [CHO] line). NTA does not affect the genetic inactivity of water-soluble Cr(III) (Cr2[SO4]3) and the direct mutagenicity of soluble Cr(VI) (Na2CrO4,K2Cr2O7) compounds. The very insoluble Cr(VI) compounds PbCrO4 and PbCrO4 X PbO are instead clearly mutagenic in the Salmonella/microsome assay (TA100 strain) only in the presence of NTA or NaOH. The mutagenicity of lead chromates is correlated with the amounts of Cr(VI) solubilized by NTA or alkali, as detected by the colorimetric reaction with diphenylcarbazide and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. In the SCE assay, the insoluble lead chromates are directly clastogenic owing to prolonged treatment conditions and cellular endocytosis. The chromosome-damaging activity of PbCrO4 is significantly increased by NTA but not by NaOH.",Is NTA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1537 strain?,True

Their main components are R-(+)-limonene, β-thujene, α-myrcene and γ-terpinene. The aim of this work was to evaluate their antimutagenic and antioxidant capacities. Antimutagenic properties were evaluated against MNNG and ENNG on S. typhimurium TA100; against 2AA on strain TA98 and in front of 4NQO and NOR on strain TA102. Both were antimutagenic against MNNG (p < 0.001) but only C. latifolia was antimutagenic against ENNG (p < 0.001). Both presented antimutagenic activity against 2AA (p < 0.001). They were antioxidant against the ROS-generating compound 4NQO (p < 0.001) and the antibiotic NOR (p < 0.001). In the antioxidant evaluation, the activity in DPPH assay was in a range of 6-23% for C. sinensis and of 22-71% for C. latifolia. Both were antioxidant compared with BHT in β-carotene bleaching assay and were able to decreased apoptosis in HaCat cells stimulated with H 2 O 2 .

The present study evaluated the antioxidant activity in relation to the mutagenic and antimutagenic activity properties of leaf (LME) and stem (SME) methanolic extracts of A. californica collected in the central Mexican state of Querétaro. Antioxidant properties and total phenols of extracts were evaluated using DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and Folin-Ciocalteu methods, respectively. Mutagenicity was evaluated using the Ames test employing Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains (TA98, TA100, and TA102), with and without an aroclor 1254 (S9 mixture). Antimutagenesis was performed against mutations induced on the Ames test with MNNG, 2AA, or 4NQO. SME presented the highest antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content. None of the extracts exhibited mutagenicity in the Ames test. The extracts produced a significant reduction in 2AA-induced mutations in S. typhimurium TA98. In both extracts, mutagenesis induced by 4NQO or methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) was reduced only if the exposure of strains was <10 μg/Petri dish.

507,"Inonotus obliquus is a mushroom commonly known as Chaga that is widely used in folk medicine in Siberia, North America, and North Europe. Here, we evaluated the antimutagenic and antioxidant capacities of subfractions of Inonotus obliquus extract. The ethyl acetate extract was separated by vacuum chromatography into three fractions, and the fraction bearing the highest antimutagenic activity was subsequently separated into four fractions by reversed phase (ODS-C18) column chromatography. The most antimutagenic fraction was then separated into two subfractions (subfractions 1 and 2) by normal phase silica gel column chromatography. Ames test analysis revealed that the subfractions were not mutagenic. At 50 μg/plate, subfractions 1 and 2 strongly inhibited the mutagenesis induced in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 by the directly acting mutagen MNNG (0.4 μg/plate) by 80.0% and 77.3%, respectively.

These compounds also showed the suppression of SOS-inducing activity against the other mutagens aflatoxin B1 (AfB1) and 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), which require liver-metabolizing enzymes, and UV irradiation. In addition to the antimutagenic activities of these compounds against furylfuramide, Trp-P-1 and activated Trp-P-1 were also assayed by the Ames test using S. typhimurium TA100.",Is Chrysanthemum morifolium mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
514,"Phenylpropanoids that possess antimutagenic activity were isolated from the buds of clove (Syzygium aromaticum). The isolated compounds suppressed the expression of the umu gene following the induction of SOS response in the Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 that have been treated with various mutagens. The suppressive compounds were mainly localized in the ethyl acetate extract fraction of the processed clove. This ethyl acetate fraction was further fractionated by silica gel column chromatography, which resulted in the purification and subsequent identification of the suppressive compounds. Electron impact mass spectrometry, IR, and (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy were then used to delineate the structures of the compounds that confer the observed antimutagenic activity. The secondary suppressive compounds were identified as dehydrodieugenol (1) and trans-coniferyl aldehyde (2). When using 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (furylfuramide) as the mutagen, compound 1 suppressed 58% of the umu gene expression as compared to the controls at a concentration of 0.60 micromol/mL, with an ID(50) (50% inhibitory dose) value of 0.48 micromol/mL, and compound 2 suppressed 63% of the umu gene expression as compared to the controls at a concentration of 1.20 micromol/mL, with an ID(50) value of 0.76 micromol/mL. Additionally, compounds 1 and 2 were tested for their ability to suppress the mutagenic activity of other well-known mutagens such as 4-nitroquinolin 1-oxide (4NQO) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), which do not require liver metabolizing enzymes, and aflatoxin B(1) (AfB(1)) and 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), which require liver metabolizing enzymes and activated Trp-P-1 and UV irradiation. Compounds 1 and 2 showed dramatic reductions in their mutagenic potential of all of the aforementioned chemicals or treatment. For the search of the structure-activity relationship, the derivatives of 1 and 2 (1a and 2a-c) were also assayed with all mutagens. Finally, the antimutagenic activities of compounds 1, 1a, 2, and 2a-c against furylfuramide, Trp-P-1, and activated Trp-P-1 were assayed by the Ames test using the S. typhimurium TA100 strain.",Is Phenylpropanoids mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
515,"Free radical mediated genetic instability is widely thought to be a major etiological factor for initiation of carcinogenesis. Mushrooms represent a largely untapped source of powerful new pharmaceutical products. In the present study, we examined the antiperoxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antimutagenic activities of the ethanol extract of the mycelium of a medicinal mushroom, Ganoderma lucidum, occurring in south India. Antiperoxidative activity was evaluated using Fe(2+)-ascorbate-induced lipid peroxidation in rat liver homogenate and a phorbol ester (croton oil)-induced lipid peroxidation in mouse skin. Antiinflammatory activity was evaluated against carrageenan-induced acute and formalin-induced chronic inflammatory paw edema in mouse and phorbol ester-induced mouse skin inflammation. Antimutagenic activity was determined by the Ames mutagenicity assay using histidine mutant of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98, TA100, and TA102. Sodium azide (NaN(3)), N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD), and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) were used as the mutagens. The extract showed significant inhibition of Fe(2+)-induced peroxidation of lipid in rat liver (IC(50) 510 +/- 22 microg/ml) and 37% inhibition of croton oil-induced peroxidation on the mouse skin at 20 mg/0.1 ml/skin. Carrageenan-induced acute and formalin-induced chronic inflammatory edema were inhibited by 56 and 60%, respectively, by the extract at 1,000 mg/kg body wt (i.p). The extract at a concentration of 5 mg/plate showed inhibition of mutagenicity elicited by direct acting mutagens, NaN(3) (55.5 and 75.7%) and MNNG (50.0 and 57.5%) for S. typhymurium strains TA100 and TA102, respectively. The extract at the same concentration also inhibited mutagenicity elicited by NPD (52.4 and 64.2%) and B[a]P (60.7 and 59.6%) for TA98 and TA100 strains, respectively. The B[a]P was activated in the presence of rat liver microsomal (S9) fraction. The results of our study revealed that ethanol extract of Ganoderma lucidum mycelium possessed significant antiperoxidative, antiinflammatory, and antimutagenic activities. The findings suggest a medicinal use for the ethanol extract of the mycelium of G. lucidum occurring in South India.",Is Ganoderma lucidum mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
516,"The MeOH extract of Pueraria thunbergiana (Leguminosae) flowers and its fractions were subjected to Ames test to test the antimutagenicity. EtOAc fraction (1 mg/plate) decreased the number of revertants of Salmonella typhymurium TA100 by 95% against aflatoxin B, (AFB1). Phytochemical isolation of the EtOAc fraction afforded four isoflavonoids (tectorigenin, glycitein, tectoridin and glycitin) and one saponin (kaikasaponin III). Though the three isoflavonoids other than tectoridin showed significant antimutagenicity, the activity of kaikasaponin III was the most potent. Kaikasaponin III (1 mg/plate) decreased the number of revertants of S. typhymurium TA100 by 99% against AFB, but by 75% against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Tectorigenin (1 mg/plate) inhibited the AFB1-induced mutagenicity by 90% and MNNG-induced one by 76%. Glycitein and glycitin were less active than tectorigenin and kaikasaponin III. This result suggested that kaikasponin III prevents the metabolic activation of AFB1 and scavenge electrophilic intermediate capable of mutation. The two components with potent activities, tectorigenin and kaikasaonin III, significantly prevented the malondialdehyde formation caused by bromobenzene in the rat.",Is Pueraria thunbergiana mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
517,"Methanolic extract of Phyllanthus amarus was tested for its anti-mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA100, and TA102 (Ames test). P. amarus extract was able to inhibit the activation and mutagenicity of 2-acetaminofluorene (2-AAF) and aflatoxinB(1) at concentrations of 0.25-2 mg/plate. It was also found to inhibit mutagenicity induced by direct acting mutagens sodium azide (NaN(3)), N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), and 4-nitro-0-phenylenediamine (NPD), at concentrations of 1 mg to 0.25 mg/plate. Urinary mutagenicity produced in rats by benzo[a] pyrene was found to be significantly inhibited by the oral administration of Phyllanthus extract. These results indicate significant anti-mutagenicity of the extract in vitro as well as in vivo.",Is Phyllanthus amarus mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 strain?,False
518,"In this study, corn fractions obtained from an isolation process of anti-mutagenic factors in our previous research work (Burgos-Hernández et al., 2001), were subjected to several analyses for chemical/structural elucidation. The anti-mutagenic activity of these fractions was tested against aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) and 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), a mutagen that does not require bioactivation. Two concentrations of this agent in the corn fractions were tested for anti-mutagenicity in the Salmonella/microsomal mutagenicity assay, using tester strain TA100 with no metabolic activation. Corn fractions tested showed evidence of anti-mutagenic activity by producing a dose-response type of relationship between a constant amount of MNNG and several concentrations of tested corn fraction. Five different varieties of yellow corn were tested in order to determine if the anti-mutagenic factors were intrinsic to corn. Variety of the corn did not show an effect on the reduction of the mutagenic potential of AFB(1) suggesting that anti-mutagenic compounds are intrinsic to corn. Four corn fractions, previously obtained after the isolation process were analyzed by MALDI-MS and GC-MS. MALDI-MS showed the presence of two groups of molecules or molecular fragments. The molecular mass of one group ranged from 250 to 370 m/z, the other ranged from 540 to 640 m/z. GC-MS identified linoleic acid as one of the compounds responsible for the anti-mutagenic activity present in corn.",Is corn fractions mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
519,"The diethyl ether extracts isolated from unfermented milk and milk fermented by Enterococcus faecium exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of mutagenesis induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), nitrovin (NIT), 5-nitro-2-furylacrylic acid (NFA) and UV-irradiation on the Ames bacterial test (Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97 and TA100) and the unicellular flagellate Euglena gracilis. Overall, the fermented milk extract was the most active against UV-irradiation, less active against NIT and MNNG, and the least active against NFA on bacteria. The highest antibleaching effects were observed against MNNG. The differences between antimutagenic effects from fermented and unfermented milk extracts were determined to be statistically significant at the 0.95 CI level.",Is milk mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
520,"Antimutagens from gaiyou (Artemisia argyi Levl. et Vant., Compositae) were examined. The methanol extract prepared from aerial parts of this plant strongly reduced the mutagenicity of 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), when Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was used in the presence of the rat liver microsomal fraction. The antimutagens were purified chromatographically while monitoring the antimutagenic activity against Trp-P-2 with a modified Ames test employing a plate method. This purification resulted in the isolation of four strong antimutagens, 5,7-dihydroxy-6,3',4'-trimethoxyflavone (eupatilin), 5, 7,4'-trihydroxy-6,3'-dimethoxyflavone (jaceosidin), 5,7, 4'-trihydroxyflavone (apigenin) and 5,7, 4'-trihydroxy-3'-methoxyflavone (chrysoeriol) from the methanol extract. These antimutagenic flavones exhibited strong antimutagenic activity against not only Trp-P-2 but also against other heterocyclic amines, such as 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4, 3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3, 8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-3-methyl-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (MeA(alpha)C) in S. typhimurium TA98. In contrast, they did not exhibit antimutagenic activity against benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO), 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 2-nitrofluorene (2-NF) or furylfuramide (AF-2) in S. typhimurium TA98, or B[a]P, 4-NQO, 2-NF, AF-2, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) or sodium azide (SA) in Salmonella typhimurium TA100, whereas they decreased the mutagenicity caused by aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) and 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA) in both of these tester strains. Regarding the structure-activity relationship, the tested flavones had distinct differences in the intensities of their antimutagenic activities according to the differences of their substitution patterns. Namely, the intensity of antimutagenic activities against Trp-P-2 decreased in the order of: 5,7,3',4'-tetrasubstituted flavones (IC(50): <0.1 mmol/plate), 5,7,4'-trisubstituted flavones (IC(50): 0.120-0.260 mmol/plate), 5,6,7,3',4'-pentasubstituted flavones (IC(50): 0.440-0. 772 mmol/plate). The four isolated flavones were also studied regarding their antimutagenic mechanisms with preincubation methods of the modified Ames test and emission spectroscopic analysis. The results suggested that all isolated flavones were desmutagens which directly inactivated Trp-P-2 or inhibited its metabolic activation.",Is gaiyou mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
521,"A bibenzyl compound that possesses antimutagenic activity was isolated from the storage stem of Dendrobium nobile. The isolated compound suppressed the expression of the umu gene following the induction of SOS response in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 that have been treated with various mutagens. The suppressive compound was mainly localized in the n-hexane extract fraction of the processed D. nobile. This n-hexane fraction was further fractionated by silica gel column chromatography, which resulted in the purification and subsequent identification of the suppressive compound. EI-MS and (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy were then used to delineate the structure of the compound that confers the observed antimutagenic activity. Comparison of the obtained spectrum with that found in the literature indicated that moscatilin is the secondary suppressive compound. When using 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (furylfuramide) as the mutagen, moscatilin suppressed 85% of the umu gene expression compared to the controls at <0.73 micromol/mL, with an ID(50) value of 0.41 micromol/mL. Additionally, moscatilin was tested for its ability to suppress the mutagenic activity of other well-known mutagens such as 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), UV irradiation, 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3b]indole (Trp-P-1), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), and aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)). With all of the aforementioned chemicals or treatments, moscatilin showed a dramatic reduction in their mutagenic potential. Interestingly, moscatilin almost completely suppressed (97%) the AFB(1)-induced SOS response at concentrations <0.73 micromol/mL, with an ID(50) of 0.08 micromol/mL. Finally, the antimutagenic activities of moscatilin against furylfuramide and Trp-P-1 were assayed by the Ames test using the S. typhimurium TA100 strain. The results those experiments indicated that moscatilin demonstrated a dramatic suppression of the mutagenicity of only Trp-P-1 but not furylfuramide.",Is bibenzyl mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
522,"The mutagenic and antimutagenic activities of forty-two synthetic flavones were assessed by the Ames test. The tested flavones included twenty-three 3-nitroflavones, eighteen 3-aminoflavones and the 3-chloroflavone. The mutagenicity was evaluated with Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and YG1042 (an overproducing nitroreductase and O-acetyltransferase TA100 strain) with and without metabolic activation (S9 mix). The antimutagenicity of the non mutagenic derivatives was evaluated against 11 known reference mutagens. A total of 39 synthetic flavones were mutagenic. The mutagenic activities ranged from 0.1 rev/nmole (4'-chloro-6-methoxy-3-nitroflavone) to 6240 rev/nmole (4'-methoxy-3, 3'-diaminoflavone). Two differences were found between the 3-amino and the 3-nitroflavones: (i) the mutagenicity of the 3-aminoflavones required the presence of the metabolic activation; (ii) the 3-amino derivatives were more mutagenic than their 3-nitro counterparts. Increased mutagenicity, as assessed with strain YG1042, was limited to 17/39 derivatives. The mutagenic activity was induced by the presence of the double bond at the 2,3-position for conjugation of the lone-pair electron with the carbonyl group on the 'C' ring. This mutagenicity was modulated by substituents at the 2'-position. Additional mutagenicity was brought by the aminoaromatic and nitroaromatic group reduction by bacterial nitroreductases and by the S9 mix; it was modulated by different substituents on the aromatic rings of the flavones. Three flavones: 3-chloroflavone (1C), 4'-hydroxy-3-nitroflavone (23N) and 2',3-diaminoflavone (2A) showed antimutagenic properties. Compound 1C was efficient against benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), 2-aminofluorene (2AF), 2-aminoanthracene (2AA), 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) and 1-methyl-3'-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Compound 23N inhibited the mutagenicity of BaP and MNNG. The antimutagenic activity of 2A was limited to MNNG.",Is flavones mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
523,"We describe here the isolation and identification of palmitic acid as being responsible for significant anti-N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitroguanidine (MNNG) activity in yogurt. The Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA100) was used to direct fractionation of activity. Yogurt was freeze-dried and extracted with acetone to yield a crude extract. The crude extract was purified by normal phase silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, and reversed phase medium pressure liquid chromatographies. The major compound in the active medium pressure liquid chromatographic fractions was determined to be palmitic acid on GC and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems, and by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. Other saturated straight chain and methyl branched fatty acids were detected by GC/MS and were later shown to possess anti-MNNG activity. Of the straight chain fatty acids, palmitic acid had the highest anti-MNNG activity. All omega - 1 methyl branched fatty acids tested were more active than their straight chain counterparts. A trace amount of isopalmitic acid (14-methyl pentadecanoic acid), a minor milk lipid, was detected in one of the active fractions, and was later shown to be five times more active than palmitic acid. Isopalmitic acid also inhibited mutagenesis induced 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4NQO), and 7, 12-dimethyl benz[a]anthracene (DMBA), and was found to inhibit the metabolic activation of DMBA.",Is palmitic acid mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
524,"Reconstituted non-fat dry milk powder, fermented by a mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus CH3 and Lactobacillus bulgaricus 191R to produce yogurt, was freeze-dried and extracted in acetone. After evaporation of the acetone, the extract was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and tested for antimutagenicity. In the Ames test, significant dose-dependent activity was observed against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), 4-nitro-quinoline-N-oxide (4NQO), 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB), 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benz[a]anthracene (DMBA), and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole acetate (Trp-P-2). Weak activity was observed against 1,2,7,8-diepoxyoctane (DEO), and no activity was observed against methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), or aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). In a related assay (Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7), significant antimutagenic activity was detected against MNNG and 4NQO. Activity against the experimental colon carcinogens MNNG and DMAB was examined further, as assayed in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA100). Compounds responsible for both activities were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in DMSO. Adjustment of yogurt pH to 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the amount of anti-MNNG activity recovered. In contrast, extractability of anti-DMAB activity was significantly greater at acidic pH. Conjugated linoleic acid, a known dairy anticarcinogen, failed to inhibit mutagenesis caused by either mutagen, suggesting that other yogurt-derived compound(s) are responsible. Unfermented milk was treated with lactic acid, yogurt bacteria without subsequent growth, or both, to determine if formation of antimutagenic activity required bacterial growth. Extracts of the milk treatments exhibited the same weak antimutagenicity observed in unfermented milk, approximately 2.5-fold less than in the yogurt extracts, suggesting that antimutagenic activity is associated with bacterial growth.",Is dry milk mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
525,"Lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus Stapf) was extracted with 80% ethanol. The extract was not found to be mutagenic in the Salmonella mutation test with or without metabolic activation. However, the extract was found to possess antimutagenic properties towards chemical-induced mutation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. Mutagenicity of AFB1, Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2, Glu-P-1, Glu-P-2, IQ, MNNG and AF-2, was inhibited by the extract of lemon grass in a dose-dependent manner, but no effect was found on the mutagenic activity of benzo[a]pyrene.",Is Lemon grass mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
526,"The antimutagenic effects of 27 kinds of plant flavonoids on the mutagenicity of aflatoxin B1(AFB1) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine(MNNG) in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 were investigated. In the mixed applications of AFB1 (1 microgram/plate) with the flavonoids (300 micrograms/plate) in the presence of a mammalian metabolic activation system (S9 mix), chrysin, apigenin, luteolin and its glucoside, kaempferol, fisetin, morin, naringenin, hesperetin, persicogenin, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin showed the antimutagenic effect against AFB1 with more than 70% inhibition rate. A little or no antimutagenicities except flavone against MNNG (0.5 microgram/plate) were observed. For the antimutagenicity of the flavonoids on AFB1, the flavonoid structure that contains the free 5-, 7-hydroxyl group seemed to be essential. However, saturation of the 2,3-double bond or elimination of the 4-keto group did not affect the activity.",Is luteolin mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
527,"The mechanism of antimutagenic activity of ascorbic acid (AA) and its derivatives was studied using the Salmonella typhimurium TA100 bacterial test system. All substances studied inhibited N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)-induced mutagenesis. Ascorbyl palmitate (AP) markedly decreased the numbers of his+ revertants, behaving as a membrane-active antimutagen. A comparative study of the antioxidative activity of the investigated substances in the methyl oleate (MO) system has demonstrated that AA and its derivatives have pro-oxidant properties within the limits of the concentrations studied. The results obtained do not agree with the common view of the mode of action of these antimutagens, including both inhibition of free radical processes and MNNG reductive inactivation.",Is ascorbic acid mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
528,"The antimutagenic effect of dialysed cell extracts of 4 strains of propionic acid bacteria was examined against the mutagenicity of sodium azide in the TA1535 tester strain of Salmonella typhimurium using the Ames test. It was noted that dialysates of 2 strains of Propionibacterium shermanii, P. pentosaceum and P. acnes, significantly reduced sodium azide-induced revertants. The dialysate of propionic acid cocci did not show an antimutagenic effect. The inhibitory activity was enhanced if the mutagen and extract were coincubated for 20 min prior to performing the mutagenicity assay. Antimutagenicity of dialysates from P. shermanii VKM-103 against MNNG and 9-aminoacridine was shown in S. typhimurium strains TA1535 and TA97. The antimutagenic activity was found in the protein fraction of the cell extract of P. shermanii. The proteins of the dialysate of P. shermanii were separated using a Toyopearl gel column into 3 main peaks according to their molecular weights. The antimutagenic activity towards sodium azide was found in the second and the third peaks. We suggest that dialysates of the cells of propionic acid bacteria contain several kinds of antimutagenic substances with different molecular weights.",Is propionic acid mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,False
529,"Guanazole and aphidicolin were chosen as candidates in the search for a selective, non-genotoxic inhibitor of DNA replication which could be used instead of hydroxyurea to measure DNA repair synthesis in rat hepatocyte primary cultures by liquid scintillation counting. The genotoxicity of these 3 chemicals was studied using the Salmonella/liver homogenate assay and the autoradiographic UDS test in hepatocytes. Hydroxyurea was positive in both of these assays. Guanazole and aphidicolin did not induce DNA repair in hepatocytes. Aphidicolin was not mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium, whereas guanazole increased the revertant numbers of strain TA102 slightly. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine was measured by liquid scintillation to determine DNA repair induced by 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF), aflatoxin B1, benzo[a]pyrene, cyclophosphamide, H2O2, 6-hydroxydopamine, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), methylnitrosourea (MNU), 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide and UV irradiation in the presence of either 10 mM hydroxyurea, 15 mM guanazole or 0.015 mM aphidicolin. Aphidicolin had an inhibitory effect on DNA repair. Except for the 3 chemicals mentioned below, the sensitivity of the DNA repair measurement was the same, no matter whether hydroxyurea or guanazole was used to inhibit replicative DNA synthesis. In the presence of hydroxyurea, DNA repair synthesis was found at lower concentrations in the case of aflatoxin B1, due to differences in the solvent control values, and in the case of H2O2, possibly due to a synergistic effect between hydroxyurea and H2O2. Guanazole allowed the detection of DNA repair induced by MNNG at lower concentrations, probably because of an antagonistic effect between hydroxyurea and MNNG. Based on these results, it was concluded that guanazole, but not aphidicolin, could be used instead of hydroxyurea to measure DNA repair synthesis by liquid scintillation in rat hepatocyte primary cultures. Although guanazole does not completely fulfill the criteria for an ideal DNA replication inhibitor, it has the advantage of being less genotoxic than hydroxyurea, and also appears to have a smaller potential to falsify the results by interacting with the test compounds.",Is aphidicolin mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False
530,"The frequency of his+ revertants induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in the strain TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium was decreased by gallic and tannic acid. In weak buffer solutions, the inhibition effects of gallic acid towards MNU and MNNG mutagenicity was caused primarily by a decrease of pH in the incubation mixtures. At adjusted pH (pH 5.0 and 6.5), the antimutagenic effects are largely the result of an interaction between MNU or MNNG with phenolic acids outside the cells.",Is gallic acid mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
531,"Several mutants with decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were isolated from the sensitive mutagen tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA100 after treatment with u.v. and selection for resistance to N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG) and its methyl analogue MNNG. Estimation of the GSH concentration and GSH S-transferase activity in extracts of these strains and of TA100 indicates that the GSH- derivatives contain 10-30% of the GSH level found in TA100, and that they exhibit normal GSH S-transferase activity. The mutagenic activities of 7 chemicals, namely, MNNG, ENNG, 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE), 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), styrene-7,8-oxide (STOX), N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) were compared in TA100 and in one representative GSH- strain, denominated NG-57. MNNG, ENNG, DBE and CDNB are potent to extremely potent mutagens in TA100, but induce very low levels of His+ mutants in NG-57. Pretreatment of NG-57 with 1 mM GSH (partially) restores the mutant yields to the levels usually found in TA100. The mutagenic activities of STOX, ENU and MMS are similar in both strains. These results support some previous findings, namely that ENNG, MNNG and DBE, but not ENU are activated to mutagens inside the test bacteria, and also suggest that CDNB is activated by bacterial GSH. The latter finding is in contrast with the current view that CDNB is detoxified by GSH, as is also presently evidenced by a strong reduction of the compound's mutagenicity in the presence of extracts of rat liver, which contains GSH and GSH S-transferase activity. The results with STOX indicate that GSH plays in bacteria a much less important role in the detoxification of xenobiotics than in mammalian tissue, presumably due to a much lower GSH S-transferase activity in the first organism.",Is MNNG mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
532,"The liquid suspension modification of the standard Salmonella mutagenicity assay employing Ames tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 and T100 was used to study the influence of potassium, sodium and calcium on the mutagenic activity of MNU and MNNG. The toxic and mutagenic activities of MNU and MNNG were better expressed when potassium-containing solution was used as a solvent. Short-term pretreatment of bacteria cells with potassium-containing solutions increased the mutagenic efficiency of both chemicals. Potassium-induced increased sensibility of S. typhimurium TA1535 to MNU was completely reversible after 20 min incubation of bacteria in a nutrient broth at 37 degrees C. The mutagenic activity of MNU was reduced after a short-term pretreatment of S. typhimurium TA1535 with a 0.9% solution of CaCl2, while NaCl did not change the mutagenic response of bacteria to MNU.",Is MNNG mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
533,"We searched the published literature for Salmonella test data on some 450 chemicals. Only 137 of more than 400 articles containing original data satisfied minimum criteria for a quantitative analysis [1751 experiments, comprising data on 152 chemicals (Table 1)]. Many of these papers did not report basic information about the test protocol (Table 2). We used previously described statistical procedures (Bernstein et al., 1982) to estimate the initial slopes of the dose-response curves and corresponding standard errors. We also applied tests for significance and linear goodness-of-fit. We then used the results of these analyses to examine several issues: (1) Linearity of the low dose region of the dose-response curve. We found that the overwhelming majority of curves were linear, though ability to detect non-linearity of dose-response curves in the standard plate test is only limited. 7% of all experiments to which the goodness-of-fit test was applied were curves of increasing slope, and with a few possible exceptions, these were not obviously associated with any particular mutagens, even those generally considered to produce non-linear effects such as MNNG and EMS (Table 3). (2) Performance of the statistical test for significance. Results of the statistical test for significance of the dose-response were compared with author's opinions as to positivity. In almost all cases (94%) results of the statistical test and authors opinions were the same. In the examples of conflicting opinions, the reasons were: (a) the statistical test places more weight than do most authors on the presence of a linear dose-response; (b) most authors tend to require at least a 2-fold increase over the spontaneous background for 'significance', and (c) when the number of spontaneous revertants is small (e.g., TA1537), authors tend to require a larger increase in induced revertants than when the spontaneous background is large, whereas the statistical procedure makes no such distinction. These factors result in the statistical test tending to identify more experiments as positive than do authors, provided there is a linear dose-response, and authors tending to judge more experiments as positive when the dose-response is not linear. (3) Reproducibility. Among the 1751 experiments there were 122 data-sets (a total of 333 experiments) in which the same chemical was tested by two or more different laboratories under the same protocol. 21 of the 122 data-sets had some disagreement between experiments as to whether results were positive or negative (Table 4).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Is MNNG mutagenic for TA1537 strain?,True
534,"The methods for detecting carcinogens and mutagens with the Salmonella mutagenicity test were described previously (Ames et al., 1975b). The present paper is a revision of the methods. Two new tester strains, a frameshift strain (TA97) and a strain carrying an ochre mutation on a multicopy plasmid (TA102), are added to the standard tester set. TA97 replaces TA1537. TA1535 and TA1538 are removed from the recommended set but can be retained at the option of the investigator. TA98 and TA100 are retained. We discuss other special purpose strains and present some minor changes in procedure, principally in the growth, storage, and preservation of the tester strains. Two substitutions are made in diagnostic mutagens to eliminate MNNG and 9-aminoacridine. Some test modifications are discussed.",Is MNNG mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,True
535,"Mutagenicities of AF-2, MNNG, 4NQO, aflatoxin B1, benzo [a] pyrene and Trp-P-1, with or without metabolic activation, were inactivated by treatment with human saliva to a great extent in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium test strains TA98 and TA100. Mutagenic activities of quercetin, pyrolysates of beef, salmon and sodium glutamate, and condensate of cigarette smoke were also decreased to some extent by saliva treatment, but no significant effect was found on the activity of MMS and pyrolysate of polypeptone. These effects showed individual variations. The inhibition of AF-2 mutagenicity by saliva varied with temperature in TA100 but not in TA98 cultures. Boiled saliva inactivated AF-2 mutagenicity in TA98 to some extent but not in TA100 cultures. Inactivation of AF-2 mutagenicity by saliva treatment was completed within 30 sec. Complex mechanisms may be involved in the inactivation of mutagenicity of carcinogens by saliva, including biochemical reactions with enzymes, vitamins, etc. and/or adsorption with high molecular weight substances in saliva such as proteins, bacterial cells, mucous materials, etc.",Is human saliva mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
536,"The fungicide benomyl and its commercial preparations Fundazol 50WP and Benlate 50WP and the benomyl metabolite methyl-2-benzimidazole carbamate and its commercial preparation MBC 50WP were tested for mutagenicity in in vitro spot tests, in microsomal plate assay, in liquid-culture treatments, or in rodent host-mediated assay. The base-pair substitution Salmonella typhimurium mutant hisG46 and the hisG46-bearing uvrB excision-repair-deficient mutants TA100, TA1530, TA1535 or TA1950 were used as test organisms. Complete genotypic information of these mutants is given in Ames et al. [2]. Captain 50WP, streptozotocin (SZN), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), 2-aminopurine and N-acetylaminofluorene were used as positive control compounds. In nonoverlay spot tests Benlate 50WP was not mutagenic over a dose range of 50-5000 microgram/spot in hisG46 and TA1535. In overlay spot tests 50 or 100 microgram/spot Benomyl, MBC, Fundazol 50WP, Benlate 50WP and MBC 50WP were tested in hisG46, TA1530 or TA1950. Only a non-commercial MBC sample at 100 microgram/spot showed weak mutagenic activity in hisG46. In microsomal activation plate assay MBC, benomyl, Fundazol 50WP and Benlate 50WP were tested in TA100 over a dose range of 50-2000 microgram/plate. None of the compounds showed mutagenicity. In a 20-h liquid-culture treatment 10, 100, 1000 and 10 000 microgram/ml Fundazol 50WP were not mutagenic in TA 30. In 1-h liquid-culture treatments benomyl, Benlate 50WP or Fundazol 50WP failed to induce mutations in hisG46, TA100 or TA1950 over a dose range of 0.25-1000 microgram/ml. Appropriate positive controls were mutagenic in each experiment. The consistently negative results in this study with commercial MBC and benomyl preparations are contrary to positive results reported earlier with similar methods and similar commercial preparations. Possible reasons to explain the different results are presented. The alkylating agents SZN and MNNG induced fewer mutations in TA1530 and TA1950 uvrB excision-repair-deficient strains than in the hisG46 excision-proficient strain, indicating that with these mutagens excision-repair is also a mutation-prone process. In rodent host-mediated assays with Fundazol 50WP in mice 3 consecutive subcutaneous hourly doses of 500 mg/kg in hisG46 and TA1950 and in rats or mice an oral dose of 4000 mg/kg in TA1950 were not mutagenic. The positive control SZN was mutagenic.",Is MNNG mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
537,"6 nitrosamines, 5 of which cause rat nasal cancer, were tested for mutagenicity in the TA100 strain of S. typhimurium with rat and rabbit nasal, lung and liver S9 homogenates. The TA98 strain also was used with rabbit tissue homogenates. The two cyclic nitrosamines tested, N-nitrosopiperidine and N-nitrosopyrrolidine, were substantially mutagenic with all rabbit tissue homogenates in TA100, but in the rat only nasal homogenate was effective in activating them. N-Nitrosodi(n)propylamine also was activated by rat nasal tissue homogenate but not by the other rat or rabbit tissue homogenates. Diethanolnitrosamine was a direct mutagen in both TA100 and TA98. N-Nitrosodimethylamine and N-nitrosodiethylamine were not mutagenic under any test conditions. The results indicate that some nitrosamines that cause nasal cancer can be activated by nasal enzymes and that possibly important differences in activating capabilities occur among respiratory tract and hepatic tissues and among animal species.",Is Diethanolnitrosamine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
538,"Nine hydroperoxy and hydroperoxy-epidioxy oxidation products derived from either autoxidation (AO) or photosensitized oxidation (PO) of methyl linoleate (MLo) or methyl linolenate (MLn) were tested for mutagenic activity by the Salmonella typhimurium his+ reversion assay using strains TA100, TA98, TA102, TA97 and TA1537. All nine oxidation products, monohydroperoxides from AO-MLn (I) or from PO-MLn (II), dihydroperoxides from PO-MLo (III), AO-MLn (IV) or PO-MLn (V), hydroperoxy epidioxides from PO-MLo (VI), AO-MLn (VII) or PO-MLn (VIII) and hydroperoxy bis-epidioxides from PO-MLn (IX), were weakly mutagenic in strains TA97 and/or TA100. The hydroperoxy epidioxides (VI-IX) exhibited significantly greater activity in strain TA97 than did the monohydroperoxides (I, II) or the dihydroperoxides (III-V). In strain TA100, all of the oxidation products tested exhibited similar activity. No major differences between products derived from autoxidized and photooxidized MLn (I v. II, IV v. V, VII v. VIII) were obtained. Rat-liver S-9 reduced the toxicity of all oxidation products to the tester strains. The greatest mutant yields were usually obtained in the presence of S-9, but mutagenic potency was sometimes greater without S-9. The structural feature common to all of the mutagenic oxidation products was the presence of a hydroperoxy group, suggesting that this characteristic is responsible for the observed mutagenicity, either directly or through a common degradative pathway to reactive products of lower molecular weight.",Is linolenate mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 or TA1537 strain?,True
539,"Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) represent one of the main building blocks of cellular membranes and their varying composition impacts lifespan as well as susceptibility to cancer and other degenerative diseases. Increased intake of ω-3 PUFA is taught to compensate for the abundance of ω-6 PUFA in modern human diet and prevent cardiocirculatory diseases. However, highly unsaturated PUFA of marine and seed origin easily oxidize to aldehydic products which form DNA adducts. With increased PUFA consumption it is prudent to re-evaluate ω-3 PUFA safety and the genotoxic hazards of their metabolites. We have used the standard Ames test to examine the mutagenicity of 2 hexenals derived from lipid peroxidation of the common ω-3 PUFA in human diet and tissues. Both 4-hydroxyhexenal and 2-hexenal derived from the ω-3 docosahexaenoic and α-linolenic acid, respectively, induced base substitutions in the TA104 and TA100 Ames strains in a dose dependent manner. Their mutagenicity was dependent on the Y-family DNA polymerase RI and they did not induce other types of mutations such as the -2 and -1 frameshifts in the TA98 and TA97 strains. Our results expand previous findings about the mutagenicity of related ω-3 peroxidation product 4-oxohexenal and raise alert that overuse of ω-3 rich oils may have adverse effect on genome stability.",Is α-linolenic acid mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
540,"Antimutagenic activities of hexane extracts obtained from the fruit extract (UE) and the Kernels (KE) of P. mume were examined. These extracts showed inhibitory activities to known mutagens, 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide, benzo[alpha]pyrene and aflatoxin B1 in the Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98 strains. The UE and KE fractions were then separated by silicic acid column chromatography with a stepwise elution method using ether-hexane. The location of the active substances in the fractions was also determined by thin-layer chromatography. Consequently, it was found that the effective substances for the desmutagenicity were fatty acids, and identified by gas liquid chromatography, mainly as oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid in UE, and mainly as oleic acid and linoleic acid in KE, respectively.",Is linolenic acid mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
541,"Antioxidants are deemed to be important against DNA damage and mutations induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). An assay for the ability of plant phenolics to protect against mutations caused by bleomycin treatment in Salmonella typhimurium TA102 cells in concentrations up to 20 microM was developed. Caffeic acid, gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, ferulic acid and rutin hydrate in final concentrations of 0.5 to 20 microM were tested for their ability to protect TA102 cells from mutations caused by oxidative stress from bleomycin. The cut-off concentration of 20 microM was used because as a limit it is biologically meaningful, higher concentrations being unrealistic in vivo. Caffeic acid was very potent at a concentration of 0.5-20 microM. The other four antioxidants were not effective up to 20 microM. The above assay will be helpful to characterize antioxidant molecules.",Is Caffeic acid mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False
542,"Chlorogenic acid, a compound which occurs naturally in many food items, was assayed for genotoxic activity in 3 different test systems: reverse mutations in the preincubation test with Salmonella typhimurium, gene conversion with Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain D7, and chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Chlorogenic acid was directly convertogenic and clastogenic, but lacked a mutagenic capacity in the Salmonella bioassay. The transition metal Mn2+ enhanced the clastogenic and convertogenic activity of chlorogenic acid. In the presence of Mn2+ (10(-4)M), chlorogenic acid increased the frequency of his+ revertants in TA98 and TA100 strains of S. typhimurium. Caffeic acid and, to a lesser degree, quinic acid, which are components of chlorogenic acid, also showed genotoxic activity. The results show the importance of using several assays in combination with transition metals when testing for genotoxicity.",Is Chlorogenic acid mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
543,"A total of 228 pesticides (88 insecticides, 60 fungicides, 62 herbicides, 12 plant-growth regulators, 3 metabolites and 3 other compounds) was tested for mutagenicity in bacterial reversion-assay systems with 5 strains (TA100, TA98, TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538) of Salmonella typhimurium and a strain (WP2 hcr) of Escherichia coli. 50 pesticides (25 insecticides, 20 fungicides, 3 herbicides, 1 plant-growth regulator and 1 other compound) were found to be mutagenic. 5 of them required metabolic activation (S9 mix) for their activities. Among various chemical groups, organic phosphates, halogenated alkanes and dithiocarbamates showed higher ratios of mutagens. Although 22 of the pesticides tested have been reported to be carcinogenic, 7 of them, i.e., captain, DBCP, EDB, EDC, ETU, HEH and nitrofen, were detected as mutagens in the present assay. Most of the other 15 non-mutagenic carcinogens were organochlorine pesticides such as alpha-BHC, chlorobenzilate, p,p'-DDT, dieldrin and quintozene.",Is HEH mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
544,"The secondary nitroalkanes 2-nitropropane, 2-nitrobutane, 3-nitropentane and nitrocyclopentane, as well as their anionic forms (nitronates); the primary nitroalkanes 1-nitropropane, 1-nitrobutane, and 1-nitropentane and their respective nitronates; the nitrocarbinols 2-nitro-1-propanol, 2-nitro-1-butanol, 3-nitro-2-butanol, and 3-nitro-2-pentanol and their respective nitronates; 2-methyl-2-nitropropane, and 2-nitroso-2-nitropropane were tested in the Ames Salmonella assay using strains TA98, TA100 and TA102. Nitronates of the secondary nitroalkanes 2-nitropropane, 2-nitrobutane, 3-nitropentane, and nitrocyclopentane were significantly mutagenic in Salmonella strains TA100 and TA102 at 10-80 mumoles/plate, but the parent compounds were mutagenic at only a single dose level or were not mutagenic at all in the same dose range. The primary nitroalkanes and the nitrocarbinols were not mutagenic, or only marginally so, at the concentrations tested. The nitronates of the primary nitroalkanes and the nitrocarbinols reprotonated too rapidly under the conditions of the assay for adequate evaluation of mutagenicity. 2-Methyl-2-nitropropane was not mutagenic in strains TA100 and TA102; 2-nitroso-2-nitropropane was also not mutagenic in strains TA100 and TA102, but induced an equivocal mutagenic response in TA98. The positive Salmonella mutation data for the nitronates of the secondary nitroalkanes studied correlate very well with the very slow rate of reprotonation of secondary nitroalkane nitronates at pH 7.7 (Conaway et al. (1991) Cancer Res., 51, 3143), and provide further evidence that nitronates of secondary nitroalkanes, rather than the neutral parent forms with which they may be in equilibrium, are the more proximate mutagenic species.",Is 2-nitrobutane mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True

The antimutagenicity of the fractions was tested against mutagens viz. S9-independent, namely 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (TA98) and sodium azide (TA100) and S9-dependent, 2-AF (2-aminofluorene). Among the tested fractions, CaLE fraction showed a potent efficacy with an inhibition percentage of 85.57% (TA98) and 89.93% (TA100) against the mutagenicity induced by 2-aminofluorene. The CaLE fraction could significantly scavenge free radicals in various assays, namely DPPH, lipid peroxidation inhibition, and superoxide anion radical scavenging assays with an IC 50  of 12.80, 144, and 257.3 μg/ml respectively. The antiproliferative potential of the effective CaLE fraction was assessed using MTT assay against HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells with GI 50  value of 243.4 and 324.6 μg/ml respectively. The fraction exhibited remarkable apoptosis-inducing effects through the externalization of phosphatidylserine in HeLa cells as analyzed by annexin V-FITC/PI double staining assay. The HPLC analysis of CaLE revealed the presence of catechin, epiafzelechin, and chlorogenic acid which are responsible for its antimutagenic and antiproliferative efficacy.

546,"The in vitro antimutagenic and DNA protecting potential of organic (methanol, hexane, n-butanol) and aqueous extract/fractions of Parkinsonia aculeata L. (Fabaceae) was investigated by employing Ames assay and DNA nicking assay. DNA damage by hydroxyl radicals was effectively inhibited by all the extract/fractions. A marked antimutagenic effect was observed against 4-Nitro-o-phenylenediamine and sodium azide (direct acting mutagens) and 2-Aminofluorene (indirect acting mutagen) in TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium. In Ames assay, two different modes of experiments i.e. pre-incubation and co-incubation were performed and it was observed that all the extract/fractions showed better results in the pre-incubation as compared to co- incubation mode. Out of all the extract/fractions tested, n-butanol fraction was found to be the most effective in preventing DNA damage and inhibiting mutagenesis. UHPLC analysis of extract/fractions revealed presence of polyphenols such as gallic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, umbelliferone, coumaric acid, rutin, and ellagic acid etc. DNA protecting and antimutagenic activity of this plant could be attributed to presence of these polyphenols.

547,"Mutagenic activity of organic extracts of airborne particulate matter at four different sites within the urban area of the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil, was investigated using the Salmonella/microsome assay, with the Kado microsuspension method. The extracts were obtained by sonication, sequentially extracted according to polarity, with cyclohexane (CX) and dichloromethane (DCM) solvents. The different fractions were tested for mutagenicity with the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA98NR and TA98/1,8-DNP6, without S9 mix metabolic activation. A positive frameshift mutagenic response was observed for non-polar (CX) and/or moderately polar (DCM) compounds at the different sites. The responses varied at different seasons of the year, and the highest revertants per m3 (rev/m3) values were observed at the site subject to the strongest influence of automotive vehicles (site 3) in spring (17.13 rev/m3) in DCM fractions, and in summer (13.01 rev/m3) in CX fractions. The responses observed for the TA98NR and TA98/1,8-DNP6 strains suggest the contribution of nitrocompounds to the mutagenic activity observed. Although there appears to be an indicative association between the increased mass per unit volume of air (TSP) and the mutagenicity of organic extracts of airborne particulate matter in the present study, the Salmonella/microsome assay was a sensitive method to define areas contaminated by genotoxic compounds, even in samples that present TPS values acceptable by the environmental quality standards established by law.",Is CX mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

The mutagenicity was assessed with the Salmonella mutagenicity test using tester strains TA98+S9 Mix and YG1041 +/- S9 Mix. The clastogenicity was evaluated with the micronucleus assay on Chinese Ovarian cells +/- S9 Mix. A gradient of PAHs concentrations was observed from B1 (3359 microg kg(-1) dry weight [dw]), close to industrial zones, to V2 (497 microg kg(-1) dw), away from the source of pollution. Similar gradient was noted for 1-AP (from B1: 11.8 microg kg(-1) dw to V2: 0.6 microg kg(-1) dw). However, this trend was not observed in 1-NP concentrations (concentrations ranged from 1.2 microg kg(-1) dw [V1] to 0.4 microg kg(-1) dw [B1]). Pesticides were detected in all samples. Diazinon and dieldrin were found in high concentrations in B1 extracts (74.5 and 39.9 microg.kg(-1) dw, respectively). All the sediments except V2 were mutagenic with strain TA98+S9 Mix.

No significant differences were found between exposed and control cells, indicating that THz radiation is neither mutagenic nor genotoxic under these conditions. Nevertheless, a small increase in total cell number of S. typhimurium after 15min exposure, and an increase in β-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase activities in E.coli PQ37, were observed, indicating some effect of THz radiation on cell metabolism.

No. 2 was performed. Mutagenicity and antimutagenicity of the methanol extracts of unfermented and fermented steamed black soybeans against 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO), a direct mutagen and Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), an indirect mutagen, on Salmonella Typhimurium TA100 and TA 98, were examined. The methanol extracts of unfermented and fermented steamed black soybeans show no mutagenic activity for either test strains at the doses tested. The extracts inhibited mutagenesis by either 4-NQO or B[a]P in S. Typhimurium TA100 and TA98. Fermentation with fungi also enhanced the antimutagenic effect of black soybean while the antimutagenic effect of the fermented black soybeans extract varied with the starter organism, mutagen, and test strain of S. Typhimurium examined. Generally, the extracts of A. awamori-fermented black soybean exhibited the highest antimutagenic effect. With strain TA100, the inhibitory effects of 5.0 mg of A. awamori-fermented black soybean extract per plate on the mutagenic effects of 4-NQO and B[a]P were 92% and 89%, respectively, while the corresponding rates for extract of unfermented were 41% and 63%, respectively. With strain 98, the inhibition rates were 94 and 81% for the fermented bean extract and 58% and 44% for the unfermented bean extracts. Testing of extracts prepared from black soybean by A. awamori at temperatures 25, 30 and 35 degrees C and for times of 1-5 days revealed that, generally, the extract prepared from beans fermented at 30 degrees C for 3 days exhibited the greatest inhibition against the mutagenic effects of 4-NQO and B[a]P.",Is 4-NQO mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

The antimutagenic effect of GM against 9-aminoacridine (9-AA)- and sodium azide (NaN3)-induced mutagenicity was revealed in the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97 and TA100, respectively. GM showed anticlastogenic effect against N-nitroso-N'-methylurea (NMU) induced chromosome aberrations in the Vicia sativa assay. The bioprotective effect of GM co-treated with methyl-methane-sulphonate (MMS) was also established in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii repair deficient strains uvs10 and uvs14. The statistically significant antimutagenic potential of GM was not proved against 4-nitro-quinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO)-induced mutagenicity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7 assay. It may be due to bioprotectivity of alpha-mannan and beta-glucan, which are integral part of S. cerevisiae cell walls.

The extract induced no mutations in S. typhimurium TA98 and no DNA damage in HepG2 cells. Against the indirect acting mutagen 2-amino-3-methylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoline (IQ) the extract showed significant, dose dependent antimutagenic activity, while it did not counteract the direct acting mutagen 4-nitroquinoline oxide (4-NQO). The extract also exerted a protective effect against IQ induced genotoxicity in mammalian cells of human origin. Treatment of HepG2 cells with the L. vellereus extract (125-500 microg/ml) together with IQ, reduced the genotoxic effect of the latter in a dose dependent manner. Our findings show that a methanol extract of L. vellereus is highly protective against IQ induced DNA damage in human derived cells and L. vellereus can be considered as a natural source of antimutagens with potential pharmacological applications in cancer prevention.",Is 4-NQO mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
555,"We have designed and constructed a series of plasmids that contain the major and/or minor Escherichia coli nitroreductase genes, nfsA and nfsB, in different combinations with R plasmid mucA/B genes and the Salmonella typhimurium OAT gene. The plasmid encoded gene products are necessary for both the metabolic activation of a range of structurally diverse nitrosubstituted compounds, and for mutagenic translation bypass. Introduction of these plasmids into S. typhimurium TA1538 and TA1535 has created several new tester strains which exhibit an extremely high mutagenic sensitivity and a broad substrate specificity towards a battery of nitrosubstituted test compounds that included 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO), nitrofurazone (NF), 1-nitropyrene (1-NP), 2-nitronaphthalene (2-NN), 2-nitrofluorene (2-NF), and 1,6-dinitropyrene (1,6-DNP). Our studies show that the nfsA gene encodes a product that is extremely effective in the metabolic activation of a range of structurally diverse nitrosubstituted compounds. Several of the new tester strains are more than two orders of magnitude more sensitive to nitrosubstituted compounds than the Ames tester strains TA100 or TA98. In addition to enhancing mutagenic sensitivity, plasmids encoding both metabolic and mutagenesis functions on a single plasmid provide considerable flexibility for future mechanistic studies or tester strain development, in which it may be necessary to introduce additional plasmids containing different antibiotic resistance markers.",Is 4-NQO mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
556,"We determined the antimutagenic potential of chloroform, acetone, methanol, methanol+HCl, diethyl ether, and ethyl acetate extracts of Terminalia arjuna bark against the model mutagen 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO) using the Salmonella/microsome, comet, and micronucleus (MN) tests. Salmonella typhimurium TA100 strain and human peripheral white blood cells were coincubated with various concentrations (from 5 to 500 microg) of the six extracts and 4-NQO (from 0.05 to 2 microg). We found that the 4-NQO mutagenicity was inhibited by more than 70% in the Salmonella/microsome test at the highest nontoxic extract dose of ethyl acetate (50 microg/plate), chloroform (100 microg/plate), acetone, (100 microg/plate), and methanol (500 microg/plate). A less marked antimutagenicity activity (inhibition of about 40-45%) was observed for the acidic methanol and diethyl ether extracts. The comet assay showed that acetone extract (100 microg/mL) was more effective in reducing the DNA damage caused by 4-NQO (ca. 90%), whereas the chloroform, ethyl acetate, and diethyl ether extracts were cytotoxic. In the MN test, the decrease in 4-NQO clastogenicity was observed by testing the mutagen especially with chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts (inhibition about 40-45%). The acetone and methanol extracts showed a less marked activity (33% and 37%, respectively). The results of the present study suggest that T. arjuna bark contains some nonpolar as well as polar compounds with antimutagenic activity against 4-NQO. Several explanations can be suggested, but further investigations are necessary to definitely identify the active compounds.",Is Terminalia arjuna mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
557,"The essential oils of Citrus sinensis and Citrus latifolia showed antimycotic activity against Candida spp. isolated from the oral cavity; they are neither mutagenic on the Ames test nor cytotoxic. Their main components are R-(+)-limonene, β-thujene, α-myrcene and γ-terpinene. The aim of this work was to evaluate their antimutagenic and antioxidant capacities. Antimutagenic properties were evaluated against MNNG and ENNG on S. typhimurium TA100; against 2AA on strain TA98 and in front of 4NQO and NOR on strain TA102. Both were antimutagenic against MNNG (p < 0.001) but only C. latifolia was antimutagenic against ENNG (p < 0.001). Both presented antimutagenic activity against 2AA (p < 0.001). They were antioxidant against the ROS-generating compound 4NQO (p < 0.001) and the antibiotic NOR (p < 0.001). In the antioxidant evaluation, the activity in DPPH assay was in a range of 6-23% for C. sinensis and of 22-71% for C. latifolia. Both were antioxidant compared with BHT in β-carotene bleaching assay and were able to decreased apoptosis in HaCat cells stimulated with H 2 O 2 . The levels of intracellular superoxide ion were lower in the presence of both oils. In conclusion, the essential oils of C. sinensis and C. latifolia are antimutagenic against at least three types of mutagens and have antioxidants properties.",Is Citrus sinensis mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
558,"Anemopsis californica has been used empirically to treat infectious diseases. However, there are no antimutagenic evaluation reports on this plant. The present study evaluated the antioxidant activity in relation to the mutagenic and antimutagenic activity properties of leaf (LME) and stem (SME) methanolic extracts of A. californica collected in the central Mexican state of Querétaro. Antioxidant properties and total phenols of extracts were evaluated using DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and Folin-Ciocalteu methods, respectively. Mutagenicity was evaluated using the Ames test employing Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains (TA98, TA100, and TA102), with and without an aroclor 1254 (S9 mixture). Antimutagenesis was performed against mutations induced on the Ames test with MNNG, 2AA, or 4NQO. SME presented the highest antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content. None of the extracts exhibited mutagenicity in the Ames test. The extracts produced a significant reduction in 2AA-induced mutations in S. typhimurium TA98. In both extracts, mutagenesis induced by 4NQO or methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) was reduced only if the exposure of strains was <10 μg/Petri dish. A. californca antioxidant properties and its capacity to reduce point mutations render it suitable to enhance medical cancer treatments. The significant effect against antimutagenic 2AA suggests that their consumption would provide protection against carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic compounds.

560,"Inonotus obliquus is a mushroom commonly known as Chaga that is widely used in folk medicine in Siberia, North America, and North Europe. Here, we evaluated the antimutagenic and antioxidant capacities of subfractions of Inonotus obliquus extract. The ethyl acetate extract was separated by vacuum chromatography into three fractions, and the fraction bearing the highest antimutagenic activity was subsequently separated into four fractions by reversed phase (ODS-C18) column chromatography. The most antimutagenic fraction was then separated into two subfractions (subfractions 1 and 2) by normal phase silica gel column chromatography. Ames test analysis revealed that the subfractions were not mutagenic. At 50 μg/plate, subfractions 1 and 2 strongly inhibited the mutagenesis induced in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 by the directly acting mutagen MNNG (0.4 μg/plate) by 80.0% and 77.3%, respectively. They also inhibited 0.15 μg/plate 4NQO-induced mutagenesis in TA98 and TA100 by 52.6-62.0%. The mutagenesis in TA98 induced by the indirectly acting mutagens Trp-P-1 (0.15 μg/plate) and B(α)P (10 μg/plate) was reduced by 47.0-68.2% by the subfractions, while the mutagenesis in TA100 by Trp-P-1 and B(α)P was reduced by 70.5-87.2%. Subfraction 1 was more inhibitory than subfraction 2 with regard to the mutagenic effects of 4NQO, Trp-P-1, and B(α)P. Subfractions 1 and 2 also had a strong antioxidant activity against DPPH radicals and were identified by MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR analyses as 3β-hydroxy-lanosta-8, 24-dien-21-al and inotodiol, respectively. Thus, we show that the 3beta-hydroxy-lanosta-8, 24-dien-21-al and inotodiol components of Inonotus obliquus bear antimutagenic and antioxidative activities.",Is 4NQO mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

Here, the antioxidative and antimutagenic activities of a 70% ethanol extract from masou salmon (MSE) caught in South Korea was investigated. Folin-Ciocalteu's procedure was used to show the total phenol content of MSE was 3.6+/-0.2 mg/g. Free radical scavenging activity testing using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical assay system revealed that MSE had considerable antioxidant activity. MSE also had strong reducing power. The Ames Salmonella mutagenicity test employing histidine mutants of the Salmonella typhimurium tester stains TA98 and TA100 was used to examine the mutagenicity of MSE. No mutagenic activity was observed for either test strains at all doses (0.25-25.0 mg/plate). The same test was used to examine the ability of MSE to prevent the acquisition of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO)- and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)-induced mutations.

VCP-IS-2Na was assayed with chemical mutagens, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (furylfuramide) and 4-nitroquinolin 1-oxide (4NQO), which do not require liver metabolizing enzymes. VCP-IS-2Na at a concentration of 0.40 micromol/ml suppressed 66.2%, 54.7% and 60.2% of the SOS-inducing activity on MNNG, furylfuramide, and 4NQO, and the 50% inhibitory dose value (ID(50)) was 0.12 micromol/ml, 0.26 micromol/ml, and 0.17 micromol/ml, respectively. In addition, VCP-IS-2Na was assayed with 2-aminoanthracene (2AA) and 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), which require liver metabolizing enzymes. To study the structure-activity relationship, L-ascorbic acid (VC) and VCP-Na were also assayed with all mutagens. VCP-IS-2Na, suppressed the chemical and physical mutagens-induced SOS response greater than VC and VCP-Na in the umu test. Also, the antimutagenic activities of VCP-IS-2Na, VC, and VCP-Na against MNNG and Trp-P-1 were assayed by the Ames test using the S. typhimurium TA100 strain.

The methanol extract was re-extracted with hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol, and water. The ethyl acetate fraction showed a suppressive effect. Suppressive compounds in the ethyl acetate fraction were isolated by silica gel column chromatography and identified as the flavonoids acacetin (1), apigenin (2), luteolin (3), and quercetin (4) by EI-MS, IR, and (1)H and 13C NMR spectroscopy.

Electron impact mass spectrometry, IR, and (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy were then used to delineate the structures of the compounds that confer the observed antimutagenic activity. The secondary suppressive compounds were identified as dehydrodieugenol (1) and trans-coniferyl aldehyde (2). When using 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (furylfuramide) as the mutagen, compound 1 suppressed 58% of the umu gene expression as compared to the controls at a concentration of 0.60 micromol/mL, with an ID(50) (50% inhibitory dose) value of 0.48 micromol/mL, and compound 2 suppressed 63% of the umu gene expression as compared to the controls at a concentration of 1.20 micromol/mL, with an ID(50) value of 0.76 micromol/mL.

Lignin preparations obtained from beech wood significantly decreased the mutagenicity induced by 4NQO, 2NF and H(2)O(2). In the case of mutagenicity induced by 5NFAA the effect was lower. Antimutagenic properties of lignin samples tested were shown also by SOS chromotest where lignin inhibited the ability of both 4NQO and H(2)O(2) to induce the SOS response. Derivatives of lignin including those from soft and hard wood, as well as from annual plants differ in their efficiency to inhibit the induction of the SOS response. The modified lignins isolated from beech and spruce wood exhibit a high level of protection. Lignins from annual plants-corn cobs and straw-only marginally evoked an antimutagenic response, but their effect was increased by hydrothermic treatment of both annual plants.

569,"The mutagenic and antimutagenic activities of forty-two synthetic flavones were assessed by the Ames test. The tested flavones included twenty-three 3-nitroflavones, eighteen 3-aminoflavones and the 3-chloroflavone. The mutagenicity was evaluated with Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and YG1042 (an overproducing nitroreductase and O-acetyltransferase TA100 strain) with and without metabolic activation (S9 mix). The antimutagenicity of the non mutagenic derivatives was evaluated against 11 known reference mutagens. A total of 39 synthetic flavones were mutagenic. The mutagenic activities ranged from 0.1 rev/nmole (4'-chloro-6-methoxy-3-nitroflavone) to 6240 rev/nmole (4'-methoxy-3, 3'-diaminoflavone). Two differences were found between the 3-amino and the 3-nitroflavones: (i) the mutagenicity of the 3-aminoflavones required the presence of the metabolic activation; (ii) the 3-amino derivatives were more mutagenic than their 3-nitro counterparts. Increased mutagenicity, as assessed with strain YG1042, was limited to 17/39 derivatives. The mutagenic activity was induced by the presence of the double bond at the 2,3-position for conjugation of the lone-pair electron with the carbonyl group on the 'C' ring. This mutagenicity was modulated by substituents at the 2'-position. Additional mutagenicity was brought by the aminoaromatic and nitroaromatic group reduction by bacterial nitroreductases and by the S9 mix; it was modulated by different substituents on the aromatic rings of the flavones. Three flavones: 3-chloroflavone (1C), 4'-hydroxy-3-nitroflavone (23N) and 2',3-diaminoflavone (2A) showed antimutagenic properties. Compound 1C was efficient against benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), 2-aminofluorene (2AF), 2-aminoanthracene (2AA), 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) and 1-methyl-3'-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG).

570,"We describe here the isolation and identification of palmitic acid as being responsible for significant anti-N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitroguanidine (MNNG) activity in yogurt. The Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA100) was used to direct fractionation of activity. Yogurt was freeze-dried and extracted with acetone to yield a crude extract. The crude extract was purified by normal phase silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, and reversed phase medium pressure liquid chromatographies. The major compound in the active medium pressure liquid chromatographic fractions was determined to be palmitic acid on GC and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems, and by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. Other saturated straight chain and methyl branched fatty acids were detected by GC/MS and were later shown to possess anti-MNNG activity. Of the straight chain fatty acids, palmitic acid had the highest anti-MNNG activity. All omega - 1 methyl branched fatty acids tested were more active than their straight chain counterparts. A trace amount of isopalmitic acid (14-methyl pentadecanoic acid), a minor milk lipid, was detected in one of the active fractions, and was later shown to be five times more active than palmitic acid.

572,"The antimutagenic activity of trans-cinnamaldehyde (C6H5CH = CHCHO) on chemically induced mutagenesis has been shown in E. coli. Using the Ames Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA1535 (hisG46 uvrB rfa) and TA100 (TA1535/pKM101), the effects of cinnamaldehyde on spontaneous reversions and reversions induced by 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide(4NQO) and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) have been examined. To observe the effect of cinnamaldehyde in the absence of functional muc genes, a third strain, TA1535/pGW201 (pKM101 muc140: :Tn5) was included in the testing. Modifications of the standard Ames test procedures and direct-plating techniques were employed to study the ""antimutagenic"" response exerted by cinnamaldehyde. In all strains tested, concentrations of cinnamaldehyde up to 25 micrograms/ml slightly decreased the number of spontaneous reversions and induced reversions were more markedly reduced. The decreases in the numbers of 4NQO-induced revertants were greater than those decreases which occurred for EMS-induced reversions. There was no effect on viability in 1% (v/v) nutrient broth supplemented minimal medium containing 5-25 micrograms/ml of cinnamaldehyde. Cinnamaldehyde did not display any mucAB dependent or independent specificity against the mutagens used. On minimal medium supplemented with histidine and biotin, concentrations of cinnamaldehyde above 10 micrograms/ml were lethal for the strains tested. When the test medium was supplemented with 1-5% (v/v) liquid nutrient broth, viability was not affected at concentrations up to 25 micrograms/ml. For both TA100 and TA1535 the presence of 20 micrograms/ml of cinnamaldehyde in 1% (v/v) liquid nutrient broth-supplemented minimal glucose broth extended the lag phase for 2-4 h with no effect on survival. Depending on the test procedure employed, decreases in numbers of revertants may reflect lethality rather than antimutagenesis. When used to test for antimutagenesis rather than mutagenesis, modifications of the standard Ames test procedure may mimic an antimutagenic response due to a decrease in the total number of revertants seen even though enough cells survive to produce a background lawn.",Is cinnamaldehyde mutagenic for pKM101 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
573,"Mutagenicities of AF-2, MNNG, 4NQO, aflatoxin B1, benzo [a] pyrene and Trp-P-1, with or without metabolic activation, were inactivated by treatment with human saliva to a great extent in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium test strains TA98 and TA100. Mutagenic activities of quercetin, pyrolysates of beef, salmon and sodium glutamate, and condensate of cigarette smoke were also decreased to some extent by saliva treatment, but no significant effect was found on the activity of MMS and pyrolysate of polypeptone. These effects showed individual variations. The inhibition of AF-2 mutagenicity by saliva varied with temperature in TA100 but not in TA98 cultures. Boiled saliva inactivated AF-2 mutagenicity in TA98 to some extent but not in TA100 cultures. Inactivation of AF-2 mutagenicity by saliva treatment was completed within 30 sec. Complex mechanisms may be involved in the inactivation of mutagenicity of carcinogens by saliva, including biochemical reactions with enzymes, vitamins, etc. and/or adsorption with high molecular weight substances in saliva such as proteins, bacterial cells, mucous materials, etc.",Is 4NQO mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
574,"The Escherichia coli mu operon was subcloned into a pKK233-2 vector containing rat glutathione S-transferase (GST) 5-5 cDNA and the plasmid thus obtained was introduced into Salmonella typhimurium TA1535. The newly developed strain S.typhimurium NM5004, was found to have 52-fold greater GST activity than the original umu strain S.typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. We compared sensitivities of these two tester strains, NM5004 and TA1535/pSK1002, for induction of umuC gene expression with several dihaloalkanes which are activated or inactivated by GST 5-5 activity. The induction of umuC gene expression by these chemicals was monitored by measuring the cellular beta-galactosidase activity produced by umuC""lacZ fusion gene in these two tester strains. Ethylene dibromide, 1-bromo-2-chloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and methylene dichloride induced umuC gene expression more strongly in the NM5004 strain than the original strain. 4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine were found to induce umuC gene expression to similar extents in both strains. In the case of 1-nitropyrene and 2-nitrofluorene, however, NM5004 strain showed weaker umuC gene expression responses than the original TA1535/pSK1002 strain. 1,2-Epoxy-3-(4'-nitrophenoxy)propane, a known substrate for GST 5-5, was found to inhibit umuC induction caused by 1-bromo-2-chloroethane. These results indicate that this new tester NM5004 strain expressing a mammalian GST theta class enzyme may be useful for studies of environmental chemicals proposed to be activated or inactivated by GST activity.",Is 4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
575,"Phosmet, the active component of the organophosphorus insecticide Decemtione EK 20, was shown to be mutagenic in the standard Ames Salmonella/mammalian microsome assay in the absence and presence of metabolic activation. It appears to be a direct mutagen inducing base substitution mutations (TA100) as well as a weak frameshift mutagen (TA97). This compound was genotoxic in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7 strain.

576,"Azido-PhIP (2-azido-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine) and nitro-PhIP (2-nitro-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine) have been synthesized and characterized chemically. The mutagenic potencies of azido-PhIP (with photoactivation by near UV irradiation), of nitro-PhIP (without exogenous activation) and of the heterocyclic amine PhIP (with activation by rat liver S9) were evaluated by means of the reversion assay in Salmonella typhimurium. Like PhIP, azido- and nitro-PhIP were potent mutagens in the strain TA98. In addition to TA98, the strains YG1024 with increased and TA98/1,8-DNP6 deficient in acetyltransferase activity and TA98NR deficient in nitroreductase were used. Photolysis of azido-PhIP generates a very short-lived mutagen whose mutagenic potency is similar in all strains used and therefore not dependent on the acetyltransferase and nitroreductase. These findings are analogous to previous ones with azidofluorene and suggest that a short-lived DNA-binding arylnitrenium ion is formed directly by the photolysis of azido-PhIP. The nitroreductase contributes to the mutagenic potency of nitro-PhIP; in TA98NR it is 37% of that in TA98. The acetylator status of the strains influences the mutagenic potencies of PhIP and nitro-PhIP only weakly. This contrasts with findings obtained with 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and nitro-IQ and with other amino- and nitro-imidazoarenes which lose most of their mutagenic activity in the acetyltransferase-deficient strain. This atypical behavior of PhIP suggests that the presumed metabolite, N-hydroxy-PhIP, differs from the N-hydroxy metabolites of other heterocyclic amino- and nitro-imidazoarenes in that in Salmonella it is not significantly activated by O-acetylation. It must therefore either react directly with DNA or be activated in a different way. This divergent behavior of PhIP and N-hydroxy-PhIP in Salmonella may also be a key to the understanding of several 'unusual' properties of PhIP in mammalian cells and organisms.","Is 2-azido-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine mutagenic for TA98 strain?",True
577,"The purpose of the studies was to evaluate an in-vitro anti-mycobacterial activity of Aloe vera and Allium sativum against MDR-MTB, their cytotoxicity and mutagenicity. Four extracts of Aloe vera and Allium sativum were prepared by Soxhlet apparatus and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) were determined by BACTEC MGIT960 system against multi drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-MTB) isolates, collected from pediatric patients. Fractions of Aloe vera and Allium sativum extracts were separated using glass column chromatography, followed by evaluation of cytotoxicity and mutagenicity by tetrazolium salt (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and Ames test, respectively. Out of four extracts, ethanol extracts of Aloe vera and Allium sativum exhibited activity at MIC 5mg/mL to 7mg/mL and 3mg/mL to 5mg/mL, respectively and IC 50  by MTT assay for combination of all fractions were 278.3mcg/100μL and 270.8mcg/100μL and in Ames assay M.I of TA98 were 0.14 and 0.07 and M.I of TA100 were 1.14 and 0.44, respectively. Aloe vera and Allium sativum extracts showed anti-mycobacterial activity against MDR-MTB isolates so, MIC of ethanol extracts of each plant and fractions of column chromatography had been checked. The MTT and Ames tests depicted that ethanol extracts of Aloe vera and Allium sativum were non-cytotoxic and non-mutagenic, and can be used in treatment of patients suffering from MDR-MTB.",Is Aloe vera mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
578,"In recent years, chronic degenerative diseases such as certain types of cancers, are becoming an evident issue. DNA damage has been for long recognized as a causal factor for cancer development because mutations or chromosomal aberrations affect oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes leading cells to malignant transformation and to the subsequent cancerous growth. Medicinal plants are often used for the prevention or treatment of various diseases with great scientific interest. Among the medicinal plants distributed in the Mediterranean region, Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl. has been used in traditional medicine for its remarkable curative properties. However, in spite of this popularity, little works have been performed on the activity so that further studies should be performed to investigate in depth the antimutagenic, antigenotoxic and antiproliferative activities of the plant. Thus, the present study was aimed to the evaluation of the potential antimutagenic, antigenotoxic and antiproliferative properties of leaves and stem bark extracts of this well-known tree. Antimutagenic activity was evaluated by Salmonella mutagenicity assay in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains. The antigenotoxic potential was assessed by umu test in the strain of S. typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. Antiproliferative activity was studied on human hepatoblastoma (HepG-2) and on breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cell lines by MTT assay. Furthermore, the antiproliferative activity observed on cancer cells was compared with that on the human normal-like fibroblasts (TelCOFS02MA) and the selectivity index was calculated to understand if extracts were able to exert selective toxicity towards cancer cells. Moreover, phenolic compounds are plant substances with a large spectrum of biochemical activities with antioxidant, antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic effects. Based on the strong evidence of biological activities of phenolic compounds, the study was focused on the determination of total phenolics and flavonoids contents, and the phytochemical composition of the extracts assessed by LC/MS. The ethanol extracts of both leaves and stem barks showed significant from moderate to strong antimutagenic and antigenotoxic effects. In addition, selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells was shown by ethanolic leaves extract and aqueous/chloroform leaves and stem bark extracts. The latter showed high levels of total phenolic contents among all the other extracts. Identified phenylethanoids (calceolariosides, verbascoside) and secoiridoids (oleuropein and ligstroside) could be responsible for the demonstrated broad spectrum of healthy properties.",Is Fraxinus angustifolia mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
579,"Myelophil, a combination of  Astragali Radix  and  Salviae Radix,  is one of the most commonly used remedies for disorders of  Qi  and  blood  in traditional Chinese medicine. Based on the clinical applications of these plants, in particular to pregnant woman, this study aimed to evaluate the genotoxic potential of an ethanol extract mixture of the above two herbs, called Myelophil. Following the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guideline methods, a genotoxicity test was conducted using a bacterial reverse mutation test with  Salmonella typhimurium  (TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537) and  Escherichia coli  (WP2 μ vrA), an  in vitro  mammalian chromosome aberration test using a Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-K1), and an  in vivo  mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus test using ICR mouse bone marrow. In the Ames test, for both types of mutations (base substitution and frameshift) under conditions with/without an S9 mix up to 5,000  μ g/plate, Myelophil did not increase the number of revertant colonies of all  S. typhimurium  strains as well as  E. coli  strain. For both short (6 h) and long tests with/without S9 mix, the chromosome aberration test did not show any significant increase in the number of structural or numerical chromosome aberrations by Myelophil. In addition, no significant change in the number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes or polychromatic erythrocytes was observed in the bone marrow of an ICR mouse administered Myelophil orally at 2,000 mg/kg/day for 2 days, respectively.

580,"Strychnos pseudoquina  is a plant species whose stem bark is used as bitter tonic beverage. The phytochemical analysis, as well as quantification of phenolic constituents and antioxidant activity of ethanolic extracts from  S. pseudoquina  stem bark, and leaves were conducted. The extracts were tested for mutagenicity (Ames test) and DNA-damaging activity (Plasmid Cleavage test). Leaves recorded the largest amount of flavonoids. The performed high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed flavonoids such as isorhamnetin and strychnobiflavone (phytochemical markers of the investigated species) in stem barks, but not in leaves. The proanthocyanidin content and antioxidant activity were significantly higher in stem barks than in leaves. Stem bark and leaf extracts presented mutagenic activity against TA98 and TA100 strains with, and without, metabolic activation (S9). The Plasmid Cleavage test did not indicate DNA-damaging activity.

We have found that Glycyrrhiza aspera ethanolic extract exhibits antimutagenic activity against N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) using the Ames assay with Salmonella typhimurium TA1535. In the present study, eight purified components from Glycyrrhiza, namely glabridin, glycyrrhetinic acid, glycyrrhizin, licochalcone A, licoricesaponin H2, licoricesaponin G2, liquiritigenin and liquiritin were evaluated for their antimutagenicity against MNU in the Ames assay with S. typhimurium TA1535. Glycyrrhetinic acid, glycyrrhizin, licoricesaponin G2, licoricesaponin H2 and liquiritin did not show the antimutagenicity against MNU in S. typhimurium TA1535. Glabridin, licochalcone A and liquiritigenin reduced revertant colonies derived from MNU in S. typhimurium TA1535 without showing cytotoxic effects, indicating that these compounds possess antimutagenic activity against MNU.

584,"Common water pollutants, azo dyes and their degradation products have frequently shown toxicity, including carcinogenic and mutagenic effects, and can induce serious damage in aquatic organisms and humans. In the present study, the mutagenic potential of the azo dye Disperse Red 13 (DR13) was first evaluated using the Micronucleus Assay in human lymphocytes. Subsequently, in order to mimic hepatic biotransformation, controlled potential electrolysis was carried out with a DR13 solution using a Potentiostat/Galvanostat. In addition, a DR13 solution was oxidized using S9 (homogenate of rat liver cells). DR13 oxidation and the reduction products were identified using HPLC-DAD and GC/MS, and their mutagenic potential investigated by way of a Salmonella/microsome assay using TA98 and YG1041 strains, with no S9. The original azo dye DR13 induced chromosomal damage in human lymphocytes, and the respective oxidation and reduction products also showed mutagenic activity, as detected by the Salmonella/microsome assay. Furthermore sulfate 2-[(4-aminophenyl)ethylamino]-ethanol monohydrate, 2-chloro-4-nitro-benzamine, 4-nitro-benzamine and 2-(ethylphenylamine)-ethanol were identified as products of the DR13 reduction/oxidation reactions. Thus it was concluded that the contamination of water effluents with DR13 is a health risk not only due to the dye itself, but also due to the possibility of drinking contaminated water, considering the harmful compounds that can be produced after hepatic biotransformation.

585,"Purple rice (Oryza sativa L. var. indica) cv. Kum Doisaket is cultivated in northern Thailand. This study evaluated the mutagenic and antimutagenic properties of hydrophilic and lipophilic components of purple rice using the Ames test. The seed and hull of purple rice were extracted with hexane, methanol, ethanol, and water. The methanol extracts had the highest amounts of phenolic acids and flavonoids, while the hexane extracts contained large amount of tocols and γ-oryzanol. None of the extracts were mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. The hexane extract of rice hull and the methanol extract of rice seed were strongly effective against aflatoxin B1- and 2-amino-3, 4 dimethylimidazo (4, 5-f) quinoline-induced mutagenesis, while aqueous extracts showed weakly antimutagenic properties. All extracts with the exception of aqueous extracts enhanced the number of revertant colonies from benzo (a) pyrene induced-mutagenesis. None of the extracts inhibited mutagenesis induced by the direct mutagens 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-acrylamide and sodium azide. The hull extracts showed more potent antimutagenicity than the seed extracts. Based on a chemical analysis, γ-oryzanol and γ-tocotrienol in the hull and cyanidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside in the seed are candidate antimutagens in purple rice. The antimutagenic mechanisms of purple rice might be related to either modulation of mutagen metabolizing enzymes or direct attack on electrophiles. These findings supported the use of Thai purple rice as a cancer chemopreventive agent. ",Is rice seed mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
586,"Lafoensia pacari (Lythraceae), popularly known in Brazil as ""pacari"", is a small tree native to the Cerrado that is used in folk medicine to treat cancer and as an anti-inflammatory and cicatrizing agent. We evaluated the genotoxic, cytotoxic, antigenotoxic, and anticytotoxic activities of an ethanol extract of L. pacari stem bark (EESB) using the Ames test and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. In the Ames test, EESB did not significantly increase the number of His(+) revertants in Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98 and TA100 at all doses, demonstrating lack of mutagenicity. Only the highest dose of EESB significantly increased the micronucleated polychromatic erythrocyte frequency in the micronucleus test, indicating mild genotoxicity. EESB produced a mutagenic index lower than the negative control in the Ames test. In the micronucleus test, at all doses, EESB caused a significant decrease in the polychromatic/normochromatic erythrocyte ratio (PCE/NCE) at 24 h compared with the negative control. EESB co-administered together with the respective positive control caused a significant decrease in the number of His(+) revertant colonies in the Ames test and in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the micronucleus test, demonstrating a DNA protector effect. EESB co-administered with mitomycin C significantly increased the PCE/NCE ratio at all doses, showing an anticytotoxic effect. We conclude that EESB has antigenotoxic and anticytotoxic properties.

588,"Methyl trans-styryl ketone is used as a synthetic flavoring agent and a fragrance additive in food and personal care products. Methyl trans-styryl ketone was nominated for study by the National Cancer Institute due to widespread human exposure as a flavoring and fragrance additive, positive results in the Ames/Salmonella assay and the mouse lymphoma L5178Y/tk+/- assay, and as a representative of the α,β-unsaturated ketone chemical class. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice received methyl trans-styryl ketone (98.6% pure) in feed for 3 months and dermally for 3 months or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. Two-year studies were conducted to provide data for assessment of possible toxicity due to exposure to methyl trans-styryl ketone. The dermal route was chosen since this is the route for highest human exposure and due to studies demonstrating systemic exposure following dermal application to methyl trans-styryl ketone.   3-MONTH FEED STUDY IN RATS Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were fed diets containing 0%, 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, or 0.4% methyl trans-styryl ketone (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 18, 36, 72, 145, or 290 mg methyl trans-styryl ketone/kg body weight to males and 19, 38, 77, 150, or 300 mg/kg to females) for 14 weeks. Groups of 10 male and 10 female clinical pathology rats were fed the same concentrations for 24 days. All core study rats survived to the end of the study. Final mean body weights of males and females receiving 0.4% and mean body weight gains of males receiving 0.4% were significantly less than those of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed groups was similar to that by the controls. Clinical findings included diarrhea and hyperactivity in males and females. Results of sperm motility and vaginal cytology evaluations indicated methyl trans-styryl ketone is unlikely to be a reproductive toxicant in male rats; however, it exhibits potential for reproductive toxicity in female rats based upon an increased probability of extended diestrus at the highest exposure concentration. In all exposed groups of males, there were treatment-related increased incidences of goblet cell hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium of the nose and nephropathy of the kidney. In females, there was an increased incidence of goblet cell hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium of the nose in the group receiving 0.4%.  3-MONTH FEED STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were fed diets containing 0%, 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, or 0.4% methyl trans-styryl ketone (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 55, 110, 220, 400, or 750 mg/kg to males and 50, 100, 200, 350, or 600 mg/kg to females) for 14 weeks.

Controlled potential electrolysis was carried out on dye solution using a Potentiostat/Galvanostat. HPLC-DAD and GC/MS were used to determine the products generated after the oxidation/reduction process. The Salmonella/microsome assay with the strains TA98 and YG1041 without S9, and the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA) using the thymidine kinase (Tk) gene, were used to evaluate the mutagenicity of the products formed.

This study aims to evaluate the broad spectrum antioxidant and antimutagenic activities of peel extracts of pomegranate. The sequentially extracted Punica granatum peel fractions were tested for their antioxidant activity by DPPH free radical scavenging, phosphomolybdenum, FRAP (Fe(3+) reducing power) and CUPRAC (cupric ions (Cu(2+)) reducing ability) assays. The methanol fraction showed highest antioxidant activity by all the four in vitro assays comparable to ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) followed by activity in ethanol, acetone, and ethyl acetate fractions. Based on the promising antioxidant activities, the methanol fraction was evaluated for antimutagenic activity by Ames Salmonella/microsome assay against sodium azide (NaN(3)), methyl methane sulphonate (MMS), 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) and benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) induced mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium (TA97a, TA98, TA100 and TA102) tester strains. The methanol fraction showed no sign of mutagenicity at tested concentration of 10-80μg/mL. This fraction showed antimutagenic activity against NaN(3) and MMS with percent inhibition of mutagenicity ranging from 66.76% to 91.86% in a concentration-dependent manner. Similar trend of inhibition of mutagenicity (81.2-88.58%) against indirect mutagens (2-AF and B(a)P) was also recorded.

The growing popularity of SYBR-type dyes is also explained by the fact that removal of the dye from the nucleic acids by ethanol precipitation is more efficient and less time-consuming than the phenol-chloroform extraction applied for the widely used phenanthridine DNA stain, ethidium bromide. To evaluate the safety of nucleic acid staining by SYBR Gold and SYBR Green II we compared the mutagenicity of these compounds, with characteristics corresponding to those of ethidium bromide, by use of the Salmonella/mammalian microsome reverse-mutation assays (Ames test). SYBR Green II and SYBR Gold did not show mutagenicity either in frame-shift or in base-substitution indicator strains, TA98 and TA100, respectively. These results were observed both in the presence and in the absence of supernatant from a rat-liver homogenate S9. Mutagenicity of these stains was not observed although their toxic concentration was reached. Toxic effects of SYBR Green II and SYBR Gold were seen approximately at the same molar concentrations as reported previously for SYBR Green I. As expected, ethidium bromide revealed strong mutagenicity with a maximum increase of 60-fold above the vehicle controls in the frame-shift indicator strain TA98 in the presence of rat-liver S9 extract. Thus, SYBR Gold and SYBR Green II do not show mutagenicity in our tests, even at toxic doses, and these DNA stains represent safer alternatives to ethidium bromide for nucleic acid visualization.",Is SYBR Green II mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
593,"Rhoeo discolor, a medical plant from Mexico, is known to be an antioxidant and chemoprotective antimutagen. Rhoeo discolor ethanolic extract (EERD) is a complex mixture, so in this study its antimutagenic mechanisms were further evaluated.",Is Rhoeo discolor mutagenic for nan strain?,False
594,"Mutagenicity and antimutagenicity potentials were tested using Ames' test in crude distilled water and absolute ethanol extracts from the stems and leaves of Peperomia pellucida (Linn.) Kunth, Eichhornia crassipes Solms, Colocasia esculenta Schott and Brachiaria mutica (Forssk.) Stapf, and the stems of Musa sapientum Linn. No mutagenic effect was found in any of the 10 mg/plate crude extracts of these plants for either TA98 or TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium, in a direct test and a mutagenic induced test by S-9 mix. Both distilled water and absolute ethanol extract of 0.5-10 mg/plate B. mutica showed strong antimutagenicity to AFB1, B(a)P and 4NQO in two tester strains. Ethanol extract of 0.1-0.5 mg/plate C. esculenta also showed antimutagenicity to AFB1, B(a)P and 4NQO in two tester strains, but the 0.5-10 mg/plate water extract had an antimutagenic effect only for B(a)P in TA98. The ethanol extracts of 5 mg/plate B. mutica and 0.5 mg/plate C. esculenta are cytotoxic, as indicated by their partial killing effect.",Is Colocasia esculenta Schott mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
595,"This study was aimed at evaluating the influence of ethanol addition on diesel exhaust emissions and the toxicity of particulate extracts. The experiments were conducted on a heavy-duty diesel engine and five fuels were used, namely: E0 (base diesel fuel), E5 (5%), E10 (10%), E15 (15%) and E20 (20%), respectively. The regulated emissions (THC, CO, NOx, PM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions were measured, and Ames test and Comet assay, respectively, were used to investigate the mutagenicity and genotoxicity of particulate extracts. From the point of exhaust emissions, the introduction of ethanol to diesel fuel could result in higher brake specific THC (BSTHC) and CO (BSCO) emissions and lower smoke emissions, while the effects on the brake specific NOx (BSNOx) and particulate matters (BSPM) were not obvious. The PAH emissions showed an increasing trend with a growth of ethanol content in the ethanol-diesel blends. As to the biotoxicity, E20 always had the highest brake specific revertants (BSR) in both TA98 and TA100 with or without metabolizing enzymes (S9), while the lowest BSR were found in E5 except that of TA98-S9. DNA damage data showed a lower genotoxic potency of E10 and E15 as a whole.",Is ethanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
596,"Pine needles (Pinus densiflora Siebold et Zuccarini) have long been used as a traditional health-promoting medicinal food in Korea. To investigate their potential anticancer effects, antioxidant, antimutagenic, and antitumor activities were assessed in vitro and/or in vivo. Pine needle ethanol extract (PNE) significantly inhibited Fe(2+)-induced lipid peroxidation and scavenged 1,1-diphenyl- 2-picrylhydrazyl radical in vitro. PNE markedly inhibited mutagenicity of 2-anthramine, 2-nitrofluorene, or sodium azide in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 or TA100 in Ames tests. PNE exposure effectively inhibited the growth of cancer cells (MCF-7, SNU-638, and HL-60) compared with normal cell (HDF) in 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. In in vivo antitumor studies, freeze-dried pine needle powder supplemented (5%, wt/wt) diet was fed to mice inoculated with Sarcoma-180 cells or rats treated with mammary carcinogen, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA, 50 mg/kg body weight). Tumorigenesis was suppressed by pine needle supplementation in the two model systems. Moreover, blood urea nitrogen and aspartate aminotransferase levels were significantly lower in pine needle-supplemented rats in the DMBA-induced mammary tumor model. These results demonstrate that pine needles exhibit strong antioxidant, antimutagenic, and antiproliferative effects on cancer cells and also antitumor effects in vivo and point to their potential usefulness in cancer prevention.",Is PNE mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
597,"Capsicum-derived ingredients function as skin-conditioning agents--miscellaneous, external analgesics, flavoring agents, or fragrance components in cosmetics. These ingredients are used in 19 cosmetic products at concentrations as high as 5%. Cosmetic-grade material may be extracted using hexane, ethanol, or vegetable oil and contain the full range of phytocompounds that are found in the Capsicum annuum or Capsicum frutescens plant (aka red chiles), including Capsaicin. Aflatoxin and N-nitroso compounds (N-nitrosodimethylamine and N-nitrosopyrrolidine) have been detected as contaminants. The ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectrum for Capsicum Annuum Fruit Extract indicates a small peak at approximately 275 nm, and a gradual increase in absorbance, beginning at approximately 400 nm. Capsicum and paprika are generally recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in food. Hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate extracts of Capsicum Frutescens Fruit at 200 mg/kg resulted in death of all mice. In a short-term inhalation toxicity study using rats, no difference was found between vehicle control and a 7% Capsicum Oleoresin solution. In a 4-week feeding study, red chilli (Capsicum annuum) in the diet at concentrations up to 10% was relatively nontoxic in groups of male mice. In an 8-week feeding study using rats, intestinal exfoliation, cytoplasmic fatty vacuolation and centrilobular necrosis of hepatocytes, and aggregation of lymphocytes in the portal areas were seen at 10% Capsicum Frutescens Fruit, but not 2%. Rats fed 0.5 g/kg day-1 crude Capsicum Fruit Extract for 60 days exhibited no significant gross pathology at necropsy, but slight hyperemia of the liver and reddening of the gastric mucosa were observed. Weanling rats fed basal diets supplemented with whole red pepper at concentrations up to 5.0% for up to 8 weeks had no pathology of the large intestines, livers, and kidneys, but destruction of the taste buds and keratinization and erosion of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract were noted in groups fed 0.5% to 5.0% red pepper. The results of 9-and 12-month extension of this study showed normal large intestines and kidneys. In rabbits fed Capsicum Annuum Powder at 5 mg/kg day-1 in the diet daily for 12 months damage to the liver and spleen was noted. A rabbit skin irritation test of Capsicum Annuum Fruit Extract at concentrations ranging from 0.1% to 1.0% produced no irritation, but Capsicum Frutescens Fruit Extract induced concentration-dependent (at 25 to 500 microg/ml) cytotoxicity in a human buccal mucosa fibroblast cell line. An ethanol extract of red chili was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA98, but not in TA100, or in Escherichia coli. Other genotoxicity assays gave a similar pattern of mixed results. Adenocarcinoma of the abdomen was observed in 7/20 mice fed 100 mg red chilies per day for 12 months; no tumors were seen in control animals. Neoplastic changes in the liver and intestinal tumors were observed in rats fed red chili powder at 80 mg/kg day-1 for 30 days, intestinal and colon tumors were seen in rats fed red chili powder and 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine, but no tumors were observed in controls. In another study in rats, however, red chile pepper in the diet at the same dose decreased the number of tumors seen with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine. Other feeding studies evaluated the effect of red chili peppers on the incidence of stomach tumors produced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, finding that red pepper had a promoting effect. Capsicum Frutescens Fruit Extract promoted the carcinogenic effect of methyl(acetoxymethyl)nitrosamine (carcinogen) or benzene hexachloride (hepatocarcinogen) in inbred male and female Balb/c mice dosed orally (tongue application). Clinical findings include symptoms of cough, sneezing, and runny nose in chili factory workers. Human respiratory responses to Capsicum Oleoresin spray include burning of the throat, wheezing, dry cough, shortness of breath, gagging, gasping, inability to breathe or speak, and, rarely, cyanosis, apnea, and respiratory arrest. A trade name mixture containing 1% to 5% Capsicum Frutescens Fruit Extract induced very slight erythema in 1 of 10 volunteers patch tested for 48 h. Capsicum Frutescens Fruit Extract at 0.025% in a repeated-insult patch test using 103 subjects resulted in no clinically meaningful irritation or allergic contact dermatitis. One epidemiological study indicated that chili pepper consumption may be a strong risk factor for gastric cancer in populations with high intakes of chili pepper; however, other studies did not find this association. Capsaicin functions as an external analgesic, a fragrance ingredient, and as a skin-conditioning agent--miscellaneous in cosmetic products, but is not in current use. Capsaicin is not generally recognized as safe and effective by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for fever blister and cold sore treatment, but is considered to be safe and effective as an external analgesic counterirritant. Ingested Capsaicin is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine in animal studies. Subcutaneous injection of Capsaicin in rats resulted in a rise in the blood concentration, reaching a maximum at 5 h; the highest tissue concentrations were in the kidney and lowest in the liver. In vitro percutaneous absorption of Capsaicin has been demonstrated in human, rat, mouse, rabbit, and pig skin. Enhancement of the skin permeation of naproxen (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent) in the presence of Capsaicin has also been demonstrated. Pharmacological and physiological studies demonstrated that Capsaicin, which contains a vanillyl moiety, produces its sensory effects by activating a Ca2 +-permeable ion channel on sensory neurons. Capsaicin is a known activator of vanilloid receptor 1. Capsaicin-induced stimulation of prostaglandin biosynthesis has been shown using bull seminal vesicles and rheumatoid arthritis synoviocytes. Capsaicin inhibits protein synthesis in Vero kidney cells and human neuroblastoma SHSY-5Y cells in vitro, and inhibits growth of E. coli, Pseudomonas solanacearum, and Bacillus subtilis bacterial cultures, but not Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Oral LD50 values as low as 161.2 mg/kg (rats) and 118.8 mg/kg (mice) have been reported for Capsaicin in acute oral toxicity studies, with hemorrhage of the gastric fundus observed in some of the animals that died. Intravenous, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous LD50 values were lower. In subchronic oral toxicity studies using mice, Capsaicin produced statistically significant differences in the growth rate and liver/body weight increases. Capsaicin is an ocular irritant in mice, rats, and rabbits. Dose-related edema was observed in animals receiving Capsaicin injections into the hindpaw (rats) or application to the ear (mice). In guinea pigs, dinitrochlorobenzene contact dermatitis was enhanced in the presence of Capsaicin, injected subcutaneously, whereas dermal application inhibited sensitization in mice. Immune system effects have been observed in neonatal rats injected subcutaneously with Capsaicin. Capsaicin produced mixed results in S. typhimurium micronucleus and sister-chromatid exchange genotoxicity assays. Positive results for Capsaicin were reported in DNA damage assays. Carcinogenic, cocarcinogenic, anticarcinogenic, antitumorigenic, tumor promotion, and anti-tumor promotion effects of Capsaicin have been reported in animal studies. Except for a significant reduction in crown-rump length in day 18 rats injected subcutaneously with Capsaicin (50 mg/kg) on gestation days 14, 16, 18, or 20, no reproductive or developmental toxicity was noted. In pregnant mice dosed subcutaneously with Capsaicin, depletion of substance P in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves of pregnant females and fetuses was noted. In clinical tests, nerve degeneration of intracutaneous nerve fibers and a decrease in pain sensation induced by heat and mechanical stimuli were evident in subjects injected intradermally with Capsaicin. An increase in mean inspiratory flow was reported for eight normal subjects who inhaled nebulized 10(-7) M Capsaicin. The results of provocative and predictive tests involving human subjects indicated that Capsaicin is a skin irritant. Overall, studies suggested that these ingredients can be irritating at low concentrations. Although the genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and tumor promotion potential of Capsaicin have been demonstrated, so have opposite effects. Skin irritation and other tumor-promoting effects of Capsaicin appear to be mediated through interaction with the same vanilloid receptor. Given this mechanism of action and the observation that many tumor promoters are irritating to the skin, the Panel considered it likely that a potent tumor promoter may also be a moderate to severe skin irritant. Thus, a limitation on Capsaicin content that would significantly reduce its skin irritation potential is expected to, in effect, lessen any concerns relating to tumor promotion potential. Because Capsaicin enhanced the penetration of an anti-inflammatory agent through human skin, the Panel recommends that care should be exercised in using ingredients that contain Capsaicin in cosmetic products. The Panel advised industry that the total polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)/pesticide contamination should be limited to not more than 40 ppm, with not more than 10 ppm for any specific residue, and agreed on the following limitations for other impurities: arsenic (3 mg/kg max), heavy metals (0.002% max), and lead (5 mg/kg max). Industry was also advised that aflatoxin should not be present in these ingredients (the Panel adopted < or =15 ppb as corresponding to ""negative"" aflatoxin content), and that ingredients derived from Capsicum annuum and Capsicum Frutescens Plant species should not be used in products where N-nitroso compounds may be formed.

598,"A study was performed to investigate the antimutagenic effect of broccoli flower head by the Ames Salmonella reverse mutation assay. Broccoli flower head being the most highly edible part in the plant was analysed for its antimutagenic effect. Without isolating the phytomolecules, the crude ethanol extract of broccoli flower head was tested for suppressing the mutagenic effect induced by certain chemical mutagens. Three strains - TA 98, TA102 and TA 1535 were used in the study. The tester strains were challenged with their respective mutagens. These were challenged with the ethanol extract of broccoli flower head at concentrations of 23 and 46 mg/plate. The plates were incubated for 72 h and the revertant colonies were counted. The crude extract did not prove to be promutagenic. The ethanol extract of the broccoli flower head at 46 mg/plate suppressed the mutagenic effect induced by the corresponding positive mutagens on all the three tester strains used in this study. The crude extract of broccoli flower head alone was not cytotoxic even at the maximum concentration tested (46 mg/plate). In conclusion, the ethanol extract of broccoli at 46 mg/plate suggests their diverse antimutagenic potential against the mutagenic chemicals employed in this study.",Is crude extract mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False
599,"Sulfonic acid esters are considered as potentially alkylating agents that may exert genotoxic effects in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. One possible source of human exposure stems from drug synthesis when the salt-forming agents methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid are used together with alcoholic solvents such as methanol, ethanol and propanol. In this study computer-assisted structural considerations and in vitro approaches (Ames mutagenicity test using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100, and the micronucleus test using L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells) were used to assess the genotoxic properties of 19 sulfonic esters. While all esters may be principally active as genotoxicants based on the presence of the sulfonate moiety, the statistical correlative multiple computer automated structure evaluation (MCASE) system (MC4PC version 1.0) using the Ames mutagenicity A2I module (version 1.54), rank-ordered the activity of the benzenesulfonic acid esters in the Ames test negligible due to an inactivating modulator and a deactivating fragment, whereas the methane- and toluenesulfonic acid esters were predicted to be positive in this test. In the Ames test, with the exception of the p-toluenesulfonic acid ethyl and iso-butyl esters, all compounds came out positive in Salmonella strain TA100. Methanesulfonic iso-propyl, sec-butyl and benzenesulfonic acid iso-propyl ester also showed mutagenic potential in strain TA98. In general, differences between results seen in Ames tests performed with or without metabolic activation were rather small. In L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, benzenesulfonic acid n- and iso-butyl ester and p-toluenesulfonic acid iso-butyl ester did not increase the number of cells containing micronuclei. The other esters were positive in this micronucleus test; however, methanesulfonic acid iso-butyl ester was found to be only weakly positive at excessively cytotoxic concentrations. These compounds were generally found to be more potent with regard to micronucleus induction when tested without metabolic activation (20 h treatment). In conclusion, the iso-propyl esters of the three sulfonic acids under study were found to be the strongest mutagens, either when tested in the Ames test or the micronucleus assay, whereas p-toluenesulfonic acid iso-butyl ester was the only compound shown to be devoid of a genotoxic potential in both tests.",Is Methanesulfonic iso-propyl mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
600,"The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of four extraction parameters (type of solvent, temperature, duration of extraction, and soil mass/solvent volume ratio) on the mutagenicity of soil extracts. Four urban soil samples were submitted to the micro-method adaptation of the Ames test on Salmonella typhimurium according to the following sequence: identification of the most sensitive strain (TA98 or TA100), the best solvent(s), the optimum extraction temperature and extraction time, and finally the optimal soil/solvent ratio. Extraction was thus performed using eight different solvents (distilled water, dichloromethane, acetonitrile, acetone, cyclohexane, methanol, hexane, or ethanol), two temperatures (room temperature or 37 degrees C), two durations (4 or 24 h), and two soil mass/solvent volume ratios (1:2 or 1:10). The results show that strain TA98 was more sensitive than strain TA100, and the observed mutagenicity was expressed as number of TA98 revertants per mg of soil equivalent. No mutagenicity was induced by the distilled water extracts, whereas most of the organic solvent extracts induced a significant mutagenic response. A dichloromethane/acetone mixture appeared to be the best compromise for extraction of mutagens from the urban soils tested. Moreover, the present study showed that a higher mutagenic activity was generally obtained with a temperature of 37 degrees C (compared to room temperature), with an extraction time of 24 h (compared to 4 h), and with a soil mass/solvent volume ratio of 1:10 (compared to 1:2).",Is distilled water extracts mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
601,"The mutagenic activity of garbage originating from a household wax industry was determined by the Salmonella/microsome assay, using the bacterial strains TA100, TA98 and YG1024. The garbage was obtained by sweeping the floor of the factory at the end of the work shift. Organic compounds were extracted by ultrasound for 30 min in dichloromethane or 70% ethanol. After evaporation of solvent, these extracts (HFS: household-wax factory sweepings) were dissolved in DMSO, and were tested for the mutagenic activity at varying concentrations (HFS-ET: 0.08-0.68 mg/plate, HFS-DCM: 0.60-7.31 mg/plate). The colouring agents (pigments) used in the production of the wax were also dissolved in DMSO and tested with the assay. The concentrations tested for each pigment were: Amaranth: 0.46-3.65 mg/plate, Auramine: 0.15-1.2 mg/plate and Rhodamine B: 0.22-1.82 mg/plate. Both ET and DCM organic extracts had mutagenic activity, especially in the YG1024 strain. The pigments behaved in a similar way, demonstrating that YG1024 was the most sensitive strain for the detection of mutagenicity, and that metabolization increased the activity. Human exposure (occupational and non-occupational) to industrial residues generated during the household-wax manufacturing and packaging process should be monitored, since this type of garbage is normally deposited in the environment without any control.",Is Amaranth mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
602,"Ocimum spp. (Lamiaceae) and their essential oils have been traditionally used to kill or repel insects, and also to flavor foods and oral products, in fragrances, in folk medicine and as condiments. In Brazil, Ocimum selloi has been used to treat stomachaches and as an anti-inflammatory remedy. This study was performed to provide data on the chemical composition, acute toxicity, mutagenicity, skin irritant potential and mosquito repellency of Ocimum selloi oil. GC/MS analysis of Ocimum selloi oil revealed that its major constituents were methyl-chavicol or estragole (55.3%), trans-anethole (34.2%), cis-anethole (3.9%) and caryophyllene (2.1%). Ocimum selloi oil given by gavage to adult Swiss Webster mice produced no adverse effects at doses as high as 1250 mg/kg body weight. Deaths and symptoms (e.g. hypoactivity, ataxia and lethargy) were observed at doses > or =1500 mg/kg body weight, being females apparently more susceptible than males. Genotoxicity of Ocimum selloi oil was evaluated in the Salmonella/microsome assay without and with S9 mixture. The oil, tested up to the toxicity limit (500-700 microg/plate), was not mutagenic to tester strains TA97a, TA98 and TA100. None of 30 volunteers of either sex exposed to undiluted Ocimum selloi oil (4-h patch test) showed a positive skin irritant reaction. A field test (six volunteers, each individual his/her own control) was carried out to evaluate mosquito (Anopheles braziliensis) repellency of Ocimum selloi oil diluted in ethanol (10% v/v). The median number of mosquito bites on volunteers' skin-recorded for 30 min after application of Ocimum selloi oil (2, range 0-3) was much lower than that noted after application of the solvent alone (19.5, 3-25) (Wilcoxon test, P<0.01). In conclusion, results showed that Ocimum selloi oil is an effective mosquito repellent that presents a low acute toxicity, poses no mutagenic risk and seems not to be irritating to human skin.",Is Ocimum spp mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
603,"Free radical mediated genetic instability is widely thought to be a major etiological factor for initiation of carcinogenesis. Mushrooms represent a largely untapped source of powerful new pharmaceutical products. In the present study, we examined the antiperoxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antimutagenic activities of the ethanol extract of the mycelium of a medicinal mushroom, Ganoderma lucidum, occurring in south India. Antiperoxidative activity was evaluated using Fe(2+)-ascorbate-induced lipid peroxidation in rat liver homogenate and a phorbol ester (croton oil)-induced lipid peroxidation in mouse skin. Antiinflammatory activity was evaluated against carrageenan-induced acute and formalin-induced chronic inflammatory paw edema in mouse and phorbol ester-induced mouse skin inflammation. Antimutagenic activity was determined by the Ames mutagenicity assay using histidine mutant of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98, TA100, and TA102. Sodium azide (NaN(3)), N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD), and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) were used as the mutagens. The extract showed significant inhibition of Fe(2+)-induced peroxidation of lipid in rat liver (IC(50) 510 +/- 22 microg/ml) and 37% inhibition of croton oil-induced peroxidation on the mouse skin at 20 mg/0.1 ml/skin. Carrageenan-induced acute and formalin-induced chronic inflammatory edema were inhibited by 56 and 60%, respectively, by the extract at 1,000 mg/kg body wt (i.p). The extract at a concentration of 5 mg/plate showed inhibition of mutagenicity elicited by direct acting mutagens, NaN(3) (55.5 and 75.7%) and MNNG (50.0 and 57.5%) for S. typhymurium strains TA100 and TA102, respectively. The extract at the same concentration also inhibited mutagenicity elicited by NPD (52.4 and 64.2%) and B[a]P (60.7 and 59.6%) for TA98 and TA100 strains, respectively. The B[a]P was activated in the presence of rat liver microsomal (S9) fraction. The results of our study revealed that ethanol extract of Ganoderma lucidum mycelium possessed significant antiperoxidative, antiinflammatory, and antimutagenic activities. The findings suggest a medicinal use for the ethanol extract of the mycelium of G. lucidum occurring in South India.",Is Ganoderma lucidum mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
604,"Sodium xylenesulfonate is used as a hydrotrope, an organic compound that increases the ability of water to dissolve other molecules. Sodium xylenesulfonate is a component in a variety of widely used shampoos and liquid household detergents where it can constitute up to 10% of the total solution. Because of its widespread use, the potential for human exposure to sodium xylenesulfonate is great. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were administered sodium xylenesulfonate in water or 50% ethanol dermally for 17 days, 14 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. 17-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Groups of five male and five female rats were administered 300 mL of 0, 5, 15, 44, 133, or 400 mg/mL sodium xylenesulfonate in distilled water by dermal application 5 days per week for 17 days. All rats survived to the end of the study. Final mean body weights and body weight gains of dosed rats were similar to those of the control groups. Dermal applications of 300 mL of 5, 15, 44, 133, and 400 mg/mL delivered average daily doses of approximately 10, 30, 90, 260, and 800 mg sodium xylenesulfonate/kg body weight to males and 13, 40, 120, 330, and 1,030 mg/kg to females. Clinical findings generally involved the skin of dosed animals and included tan or brown skin discoloration and crusty white deposits (presumed to be dried chemical) at the site of application. Neither of these observations were considered significant findings. The relative liver weights of 133 and 400 mg/mL male and female rats were significantly greater than those of the control groups, but the absolute liver weights were not increased and the biological significance of the relative differences in liver weight was unclear. In males and females, the few lesions observed grossly and microscopically were generally attributed to repeated clipping and were not considered related to chemical administration. 17-DAY STUDY IN MICE: Groups of five male and five female mice were administered 100 mL of 0, 5, 15, 44, 133, or 400 mg/mL sodium xylenesulfonate in distilled water by dermal application 5 days per week for 17 days. All mice survived to the end of the study. Final mean body weights and body weight gains of dosed mice were similar to those of the controls. Dermal applications of 5, 15, 44, 133, and 400 mg/mL delivered average daily doses of approximately, 20, 60, 190, 540, and 1,600 mg sodium xylenesulfonate/kg body weight to males and 26, 80, 220, 680, and 2,000 mg/kg to females. Clinical findings included crusty white deposits (presumed to be dried chemical) at the site of application in two 133 mg/mL males and in all 400 mg/mL males and females. The absolute and relative liver weights of 15 and 44 mg/mL males and 400 mg/mL males and females were significantly greater than those of the control groups, but the biological significance of these differences was unclear. The few skin lesions observed grossly and microscopically in males and females were generally attributed to repeated clipping and were not considered related to chemical administration. 14-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were administered 300 mL of 0, 5, 15, 44, 133, or 400 mg/mL sodium xylenesulfonate in 50% ethanol by dermal application for 14 weeks. For special hematology and clinical pathology studies, additional groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were administered 0, 5, 15, 44, 133, or 400 mg/mL sodium xylenesulfonate in 50% ethanol by dermal application for 14 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study. Final mean body weights and body weight gains of dosed male and female rats were similar to those of the control groups. Dermal applications of 5, 15, 44, 133, and 400 mg/mL delivered average daily doses of approximately 6, 20, 60, 170, and 500 mg sodium xylenesulfonate/kg body weight to males and 10, 30, 90, 260, and 800 mg/kg to females. The only notable clinical finding was brown discoloration of the skin at the site of application in dosed animals. Hemaation in dosed animals. Hematology and clinical chemistry parameters of dosed groups of males and females were significantly different from those of the controls in several instances, but these differences were sporadic and did not demonstrate a treatment relationship. The absolute and relative liver weights of males receiving 44, 133, or 400 mg/mL were significantly less than those of the control group, but the biological significance of these differences was unclear, and there were no treatment-related histopathologic effects in the liver. There were no significant differences in liver weights in female rats. Minimal hyperplasia of the epidermis at the site of application occurred in both male and female rats in the control group as well as most dosed groups. The incidence of epidermal hyperplasia in 400 mg/mL males was possibly chemical related. 14-Week Study in Mice: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were administered 100 mL of 0, 5, 15, 44, 133, or 400 mg/mL sodium xylenesulfonate in 50&percnt; ethanol by dermal application for 14 weeks. There were no chemical-related deaths. The mean body weight gain of the 400 mg/mL males was significantly greater than that of the control group. Dermal applications of 5, 15, 44, 133, and 400 mg/mL delivered average daily doses of approximately 17, 40, 140, 440, and 1,300 mg sodium xylenesulfonate/kg body weight to males and 20, 60, 170, 530, and 1,630 mg/kg to females. There were no clinical findings related to sodium xylenesulfonate administration. Epidermal hyperplasia occurred in one 44 mg/mL female, two 133 mg/mL males, five 400 mg/mL males, and four 400 mg/kg females. Hyperplasia of the epidermis in 400 mg/mL males and females was probably related to chemical administration. Chronic inflammation of the skin occurred primarily in the control groups of males and females. These lesions consisted of mononuclear inflammatory cells in the dermis. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were dermally administered 0, 60, 120, or 240 mg sodium xylenesulfonate/kg body weight in 50&percnt; ethanol for 104 weeks. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings: Survival of dosed males and females was similar to that of the control groups. Mean body weights of dosed males and females were similar to those of the controls throughout the study. In male groups, there were no clinical findings considered treatment related. In females, clinical findings were limited to irritation at the site of application in one control female, four 120 mg/kg females, and two 240 mg/kg females. Pathology Findings: There were no neoplasms at any site (including the skin) that were considered treatment related.Low incidences of hyperplasia of the epidermis at the site of application occurred in males in the 60, 120, and 240 mg/kg groups. Low incidences of hyperplasia of the epidermis at the site of application also occurred in females in the 120 and 240 mg/kg groups, and they occurred with a significant positive trend. Low incidences of hyperplasia of the sebaceous gland occurred in control and 60 mg/kg males and in control, 120 mg/kg, and 240 mg/kg females. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were dermally administered 0, 182, 364, or 727 mg sodium xylenesulfonate/kg body weight in 50&percnt; ethanol for 104 to 105 weeks. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings: Survival of dosed males and females was similar to that of the control groups. Mean body weights of dosed males and females were generally similar to those of the controls throughout the study; however, the mean body weights of 727 mg/kg females were greater than those of the control group from week 85 to week 97. With the exception of irritation at the site of application in one 364 mg/kg female, there were no clinical findings related to sodium xylenesulfonate administration. Pathology Findings: There were no neoplasms at any site (including the skin) that were considered treatment related.Hyperplasia of the epidermis occurred in control,364 mg/kg, and 727 mg/kg males and in control and dosed females. In male mice, the incidences occurred with a significant positive trend. Focal ulceration occurred in one 727 mg/kg male and in one female in each dose group. In males and females from control and dosed groups, the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepato- cellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were generally higher than those expected by spontaneous occurrence. The incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms in some groups of males and females exceeded the NTP historical control range. Male mice had a pattern of nonneoplastic liver lesions along with silver stained positive helical organisms within the liver which suggests an infection with Helicobacter hepaticus. The findings in this study of sodium xylenesulfonate were not considered to have been significantly impacted by the infection with H. hepaticus or its associated hepatitis. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Sodium xylenesulfonate was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 with or without induced liver S9. Equivocal results were obtained in a mutation assay with mouse lymphoma cells in the presence of induced S9; no evidence of mutagenicity was noted without S9 in this assay. In cytogenetic tests with sodium xylenesulfonate in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, significant increases in sister chromatid exchanges were observed in the absence of S9 only, and no increases in chromosomal aberrations were observed with or without S9. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year dermal studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of sodium xylenesulfonate in male or female F344/N rats administered 60, 120, or 240 mg/kg or in male or female B6C3F1 mice administered 182, 364, or 727 mg/kg. Increased incidences of epidermal hyperplasia in female rats and male mice may have been related to exposure to sodium xylenesulfonate.

605,"Various bean products fermented by microorganisms are commonly consumed in Asian diets; however, the safety or functional properties of fermented beans can vary with different microbial species and with different processes being applied to different beans. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the antioxidative and mutagenic properties of 50% ethanolic extracts from red beans fermented by Aspergillus oryzae. The extracts' antioxidative activities, including alpha,alpha;-diphenyl-beta-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging effects, Fe(2+)-chelating ability, and reducing power, were studied in vitro. The antioxidative effects provided by the extracts depended strongly on their concentrations. In general, antioxidative activity increased with extract concentration to a certain point and then leveled off as the concentration further increased. The fermented red bean extracts showed less of a scavenging effect on the DPPH radical and less reducing power than the commercial antioxidants alpha-tocopherol and butylated hydroxytoluene, but better Fe(2+)-chelating ability. No mutagenicity or toxicity effect on any of the tested strains (Salmonella Typhimurium TA97, TA98, TA100, TA102, and TA1535) was found for the 50% ethanolic extracts of fermented red beans with the Ames mutagenicity assay. These results suggest that the 50% ethanolic extracts were not mutagenic.",Is 50% ethanolic extracts mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 strain?,False
606,"Hericium erinaceus is valuable in the diet and in medical treatment. It contains water-soluble polysaccharides that have been found to enhance immunity and which show anti-artificial pulmonary metastatic tumor effects. In this study, water and ethanol extracts of the mycelium and fruiting body of Hericium erinaceus were examined by the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 to screen for antimutagenic effects against 5 mutagens: AFB1, B[a]P, Glu-P-1, NQNO, and Trp-P-1. We found that both extracts have the strongest antimutagenic activity against Trp-P-1, followed by Glu-P-1, B[a]P-1, AFB1, and finally NQNO. In addition, the antimutagenicity of the extracts was produced in a concentration-dependent manner. At a concentration of 200 ppm, both extracts showed the highest inhibitory action. However, the linear correlation indicated that concentration-activity relationship was not significant (p > 0.05). In addition, extracts showed less antimutagenicity after heat treatment (p < 0.05). This suggests that the antimutagenicity of the extracts is heat-labile. The ethanol extract from mycelium or fruiting body had better antimutagenic effects than did the water extract (p < 0.05). Also, the extract from the fruiting body had better antimutagenic effects than did that from the mycelium.",Is Hericium erinaceus mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
607,"The antimutagenicity of ethanol extracts of bee glue (propolis) (EEBG) was evaluated, using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 as a test model, against two direct mutagens, 4-nitro-O-phenylenediamine (4-NO) and 1-nitropyrene (1-NP), and two indirect mutagens, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) with S9 mix. EEBG was shown to suppress the mutagenicity of these compounds in a dose-dependent fashion. To delineate the mechanism of action of the antimutagenic effects of EEBG on the two indirect mutagens IQ and B[a]P, two possible points of blocking were considered: (1) cytochrome P-450 activity (route 1) and (2) interaction with microsome-generated proximate mutagens to generate an inactive complex (route 2). Our results clearly demonstrated, at a very low dose, remarkable suppression of the mutagenicity of both compounds by inhibiting either route 1 or route 2 pathway. Further studies indicated that EEBG was capable of inhibiting both the activities of hepatic cytochrome P-450 IA1-linked 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and IA 2-linked 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase (ECD) in a similar dose-dependent manner. Taken together, we demonstrated that EEBG was a good inhibitor for mutagenicity of direct mutagens, 1-NP and 4-NO, as well as for the indirect mutagens IQ and B[a]P in the presence of S9 mix via inactivation of microsomal enzyme activities (e.g. EROD and ECD) or antagonizing metabolic generation of the proximate mutagens of IQ and B[a]P.",Is EEBG mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
608,"It was recently reported that p-aminophenol (p-AP) induces DNA cleavage in mouse lymphoma cells, CHO cells and human lymphoblastoid cells. The mutagenicity of p-AP has not, however, been detected by reverse mutation assays. The purpose of this study was to assess the mutagenicity of p-AP by reverse mutation assay using Escherichia coli WP2uvrA/pKM101, which has a spectrum for detecting mutations different from those of other strains in the family with an AT base pair at the mutation site and has higher sensitivity to certain oxidative mutagens as compared to other strains. We found that p-AP was mutagenic to E. coli WP2uvrA/pKM101. The mutagenic activity of this compound was suppressed with the addition of dimethylsulfoxide or catalase, suggesting the involvement of active oxygen species in the mutagenic process induced by p-AP. To further elucidate the underlying mechanism, we used isolated DNA for the following experiments. It was revealed, by gel electrophoretic analysis, that p-AP induced DNA cleavage in the presence of Fe(III). However, p-AP alone did not induce this cleavage. Formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine by p-AP in calf thymus DNA was also detected in the presence of Fe(III) by HPLC with an electrochemical detector. ESR-spin trapping experiments using DMPO detected the production of hydroxyl radical (.OH) in the solution of p-AP with Fe(III). Both p-AP mediated DNA damages and .OH production by p-AP in the presence of Fe(III) were completely inhibited by .OH scavengers (ethanol, mannitol, sodium formate, dimethylsulfoxide) and catalase. These results suggest that .OH derived from the reaction between H2O2 and Fe(III) (Fenton reaction) participates in the oxidative DNA damage. Accordingly, the same mechanism might be working in E. coli WP2uvrA/pKM101 during induction of the mutation by p-AP.",Is p-aminophenol mutagenic for pKM101 or WP2uvrA strain?,True
609,"Ethyl carbamate is a known carcinogen occurring in fermented food and beverages and is therefore of interest for food safety assurance. We studied the genotoxicity of ethyl carbamate in Salmonella typhimurium, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells. In absence of cytochrome P450 enzymes, no ethyl carbamate-mediated genotoxicity was observed in any of the three test systems in the non-cytotoxic range. In the presence of an activating system, ethyl carbamate was found to be mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 but not in strains TA98 and TA102, indicating base-pair substitutions at G-C base pairs. In contrast, no significant mutagenicity of ethyl carbamate could be detected in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells. However, applied in cytotoxic concentrations, ethyl carbamate was genotoxic for Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the absence of P450-mediated metabolic activation. Inhibitors of P450IIE1 (DMSO, ethanol and dithiodiethylcarbamate) diminished ethyl carbamate-mediated mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 in a dose dependent manner, suggesting that P450IIE1 is the activating enzyme.",Is ethyl carbamate mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
610,"Urethane, a byproduct of fermentation found in alcoholic beverages, is carcinogenic in rodents and is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a possible human carcinogen. The United States Food and Drug Administration nominated urethane for study because of the widespread exposure of humans through the consumption of fermented foods and beverages and because of a lack of adequate dose-response data about the carcinogenicity of urethane with and without the coadministration of ethanol. Comparative studies of urethane in drinking water and in 5% ethanol were conducted to investigate possible effects of ethanol on urethane toxicity. Toxicokinetic studies of urethane in drinking water and in 5% ethanol and genetic toxicity studies of urethane in vivo and in vitro were also conducted. Groups of 10 male and 10 female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice, 6 weeks of age, received 0, 110, 330, 1,100, 3,300, or 10,000 ppm urethane in drinking water or in 5% ethanol for 13 weeks. Toxicokinetic evaluations were performed for urethane in the plasma of male mice after 13 weeks of administration in drinking water or 5% ethanol. The mutagenicity of urethane in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 with and without S9 was tested at doses up to 16,666 micrograms/plate; urethane was also tested for induction of sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells and sex-linked recessive lethal mutations and chromosomal reciprocal translocations in Drosophila melanogaster. The frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes induced in peripheral blood and bone marrow cells of mice by urethane in drinking water and in 5% ethanol was also evaluated. In rats that received urethane in drinking water, seven males and four females administered 10,000 ppm and one female administered 3,300 ppm died before the end of the study; body weight gains were reduced at these concentrations. Two males and all females given 10,000 ppm urethane in 5% ethanol died during the study, and the body weight gains of males and females that received 3,300 ppm were lower than those of the controls. Relative right kidney, liver, and lung weights of males and females and relative right testis weights of males administered 1,100 ppm or greater were generally higher than those of the controls in each study. Leukopenia and lymphopenia were observed in rats receiving urethane in either drinking water or ethanol and occurred in males receiving 330 ppm or greater and females receiving 110 ppm or greater. Other differences in hematology and clinical chemistry variables were not considered to be biologically significant. Lymphoid depletion of the spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus was observed in male and female rats receiving 1,100, 3,300, or 10,000 ppm urethane in drinking water. Cellular depletion of the bone marrow occurred in males and females in the 10,000 ppm groups. Hepatocellular fatty changes and clear cell foci of alteration were noted in the liver of males and females that received 3,300 or 10,000 ppm. The incidences of nephropathy were significantly increased in female rats that received 1,100 ppm or greater; the severity of this lesion in exposed males and females was greater than that in the controls. Females that received 330 ppm or greater had higher incidences of cardiomyopathy than the controls; the severity of this lesion was greater in males in the 10,000 ppm group and females in the 3,300 and 10,000 ppm groups than in the controls. In rats that received urethane in 5% ethanol, lymphoid depletion occurred in males and females in the 3,300 and 10,000 ppm groups. Cellular depletion of the bone marrow was observed in males and females in the 10,000 ppm groups. Only males in the 10,000 ppm group had hepatocellular fatty change (8/10) and clear cell foci (1/10); the incidence and severity of nephropathy in males and females and cardiomyopathy in males were similar to those in rats administered urethane in drinking water; however, no cardiomyopathy was observed in females receiving urethane in ethanol. The estrous cycle length of females receiving urethane in ethanol appeared to be longer than that of females receiving urethane in drinking water. Because cycle length was longer in the 10,000 ppm groups than in the controls in both the drinking water and ethanol vehicle studies, this difference may represent an exacerbation of the toxicity of urethane. A longer estrous cycle may be a sign of reproductive impairment and correlates with a decrease in female fecundity. All mice administered 10,000 ppm urethane in either vehicle died. All mice that received 3,300 ppm urethane in drinking water died, while only one male and four females receiving 3,300 ppm urethane in 5% ethanol died. Body weight gains of males and females in all 1,100 ppm groups were less than those of the respective controls, but the weight gains of mice receiving 1,100 ppm urethane in 5% ethanol were greater than those of mice receiving urethane in drinking water. The mean body weights of the lower exposure groups were similar to those of the respective controls, and there were no other differences between the body weights of mice receiving urethane in drinking water and those receiving urethane in 5% ethanol. Fluid consumption, and therefore total urethane intake, appeared lower in mice receiving the 5% ethanol vehicle than in those receiving the water vehicle. The relative right kidney, liver, and lung weights of males and females administered urethane in drinking water or ethanol were generally greater than those of the controls. Clearance of urethane from the plasma of male mice was complete within 2 hours after urethane was administered in water, but urethane was not cleared 12 hours after administration in 5% ethanol. At the end of 13 weeks of urethane administration, the plasma urethane elimination half-life was 0.8 hours; the kinetics were similar for concentrations of 110, 330, and 1,100 ppm urethane in water and in ethanol. However, at each exposure level, the plasma urethane concentration was four times greater for urethane administered in 5% ethanol than for urethane administered in drinking water, indicating a possible inhibition of urethane metabolism by ethanol. Kinetic measurements for elimination by female mice could not be obtained from the data collected. In mice administered urethane in drinking water, lung inflammation occurred in males and females that received 1,100 ppm or greater. Alveolar epithelial hyperplasia occurred in the lungs of males in the 330 and 1,100 ppm groups and females in the 1,100 ppm group; one male mouse in the 330 ppm group had an alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma (see the following summary table). Mice receiving urethane in 5% ethanol had lower incidences and severity of lung inflammation but generally greater incidences and severity of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia than mice receiving the same concentrations of urethane in drinking water. Alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas occurred in four males and one female administered urethane in ethanol. [table: see text] Nephropathy was observed in males and females that received urethane in either vehicle, and the lesions in female mice were more severe than those in male mice; ethanol did not appear to increase the incidence or severity of nephropathy. Cardiomyopathy occurred in males and females that received 1,100 or 3,300 ppm urethane in drinking water and in females that received 3,300 ppm urethane in ethanol. Lymphoid depletion occurred in mice that received 3,300 or 10,000 ppm urethane; 5% ethanol did not appear to enhance these effects. However, urethane in 5% ethanol induced ovarian atrophy; the incidence of this lesion was lower in females receiving urethane in drinking water. A concentration of 1,100 ppm urethane in either drinking water or ethanol effectively stopped estrous cycling. Urethane is clearly genotoxic in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, urethane induced mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535 in the presence of liver S9 enzymes. Sister chromatid exchanges were induced in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with and without S9. However, no induction of chromosomal aberrations was observed in CHO cells treated with urethane, with or without S9. In vivo, urethane induced sex-linked recessive lethal mutations and reciprocal translocations in germ cells of adult male Drosophila melanogaster fed urethane. Significantly increased frequencies of micronucleated erythrocytes were observed in peripheral blood obtained from male and female mice after 45 days of exposure and in bone marrow and peripheral blood obtained after 13 weeks of exposure to urethane in drinking water. There appeared to be no significant difference in the magnitude of the response in the peripheral blood micronucleus test between mice administered urethane in drinking water and mice administered urethane in 5% ethanol. In summary, concentrations of 1,100 ppm urethane or greater in drinking water caused lymphoid and bone marrow cell depletion and hepatocellular lesions and increased the severity of nephropathy and cardiomyopathy in male and female rats. The lethal effects of 10,000 ppm urethane were slightly exacerbated by 5% ethanol in female rats. Urethane administered in drinking water induced lung inflammation, alveolar and bronchiolar hyperplasia, alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas, nephropathy, cardiomyopathy, lymphoid and bone marrow cell depletion, seminiferous tubule degeneration, and ovarian atrophy and follicular degeneration in mice. In female mice, 5% ethanol appeared to exacerbate ovarian atrophy. Mice administered urethane in 5% ethanol consumed less fluid, and therefore less urethane, than mice receiving urethane in drinking water. Coadministration of urethane and ethanol inhibited the clearance of urethane from plasma. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",Is Urethane mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True

612,"Ethanol extract of Senokot tablets (Cassia senna concentrate used as vegetable laxative), was found to be non-mutagenic while it inhibited the mutagenicity of benzo[a]pyrene, shamma, aflatoxin B1 and methyl methanesulfonate in the Ames histidine reversion assay using the Salmonella typhimurium tester strain TA98. While the Senokot extract completely inhibited the mutagenicity of promutagens (i.e. metabolic activation dependent) like benzo[a]pyrene and shamma, it reduced the mutagenic activity of the direct acting mutagen methyl methanesulfonate by only 58%. The mutagen aflatoxin B1 showed a 25-fold increase in the number of histidine revertants per plate at low concentrations (1.0-4.0 micrograms/plate) in the presence of metabolic activation system while at high concentrations (10.0-30.0 micrograms/plate) it proved to be weakly mutagenic (with a 5-fold increase in the number of histidine revertants/plate) without metabolic activation. The Senokot extract completely inhibited the mutagenic effect of low concentrations of aflatoxin B1 in the presence of metabolic activation but not that resulting from higher concentrations without metabolic activation. The results obtained with benzo[a]pyrene, shamma and aflatoxin B1 indicated that the antimutagenic effects of Senokot extract could be largely due to an interaction with the metabolic process involved in the activation of procarcinogens. However, the results obtained with methyl methanesulfonate suggested that factors in Senokot may also interact with direct mutagens to produce some antimutagenic effects. An ethanol extract of crude senna leaves found to be weakly mutagenic also inhibited (though less than Senokot) the mutagenic effect of benzo[a]pyrene suggesting that the antimutagenic principle is present in the complex plant material itself.",Is Senokot mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
613,"Human hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase, human phenol-sulfating form of phenol sulfotransferase, rat hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase a and rat phenol sulfotransferase IV were expressed in Escherichia coli. Cytosol preparations of transformed bacteria were used as activating systems in mutagenicity tests with Salmonella typhimurium TA98. All test compounds, 1-hydroxymethylpyrene, 2-hydroxymethylpyrene, 1-(1-pyrenyl)ethanol, 9-hydroxymethylanthracene, 7-hydroxymethyl-12-methylbenz[a]anthracene and 4H-cyclopenta[def]chrysen-4-ol, were activated by both hydroxysteroid sulfotransferases investigated. However, 1-(1-pyrenyl)ethanol was 67-fold more efficiently activated by the human enzyme, whereas 7-hydroxymethyl-12-methylbenz[a]anthracene was 27-fold more efficiently activated by the rat enzyme. The phenol sulfotransferases showed relatively low activities with the benzylic alcohols investigated. The only exception was 4H-cyclopenta[def]chrysen-4-ol, which was activated efficiently by rat phenol sulfotransferase IV. We had previously tested the ability of rat and human hepatic cytosol preparations to activate the same compounds. The results of a statistical analysis suggest that the activities of human hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase, rat hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase a and phenol sulfotransferase IV can account for a substantial portion of the activation of benzylic alcohols in human, female rat and male rat liver, respectively.","Is 2-hydroxymethylpyrene, 1-(1-pyrenyl)ethanol mutagenic for TA98 strain?",True
614,"Toxicity and mutagenicity of Kevlar 49 (PPPT; poly-para-phenylene-terephthalamide) was tested in six strains of Salmonella typhimurium (Ames test; TA97, TA98, TA100, TA102, TA1535, TA1537) with and without an external metabolic activation system (S9), as well as in a mammalian cell mutagenesis assay using V79 Chinese hamster cells. For the Ames test, liquid preincubation, which is considered particularly sensitive, was used. The cells were incubated for 24 h at a temperature of 37 degrees C either directly with Kevlar49 or with ethanol- or chloroform-extracted Kevlar49. The experiments were performed at least twice. The Ames test with six different Salmonella typhimurium strains featuring either base pair substitution or frameshift mutations revealed no cytotoxic or mutagenic activity of Kevlar49. In the mammalian cell mutagenesis assay, using 8-azaguanine (AG) as a selective agent, Kevlar49 was also devoid of cytotoxic or mutagenic activity. Both tests have to be regarded as an initial exploratory screening due to the chosen testing conditions and should be supplemented by tests at different temperatures.",Is Kevlar 49 mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
615,"The in vivo physicochemical sorption of mutagenic substances onto acrylic polymers was investigated in worn acrylic dentures. Thus, ethanolic extracts of acrylic dentures from 41 of a total of 69 human donors (60%), were found mutagenic in the standard plate incorporation Salmonella mutagenicity test against either TA98 or TA100 strains. Denture extracts from smokers produced mutagenicity more often than the ones from non-smokers (75% vs. 45%, P 0.01). Mutagenicity was preferentially directed against TA98 (TA98:TA100 = 2.9:1, P < 0.0005). Predilection for TA98 was more pronounced in denture extracts from non-smokers (4.7:1) than from smokers (2.0:1). When direct mutagenicity was observed, it was reduced by the rat-liver S9. Induced mutant yields were 6.1 +/- 3.9 and 7.0 +/- 8.9 times higher than the spontaneous for TA98 and TA100 respectively (smokers, 50-cm2 denture surface area eq./plate+S9). Denture extracts from smokers induced higher levels of mutation than the ones from non-smokers (TA98 + S9, smoker:non-smoker = 2:1, P < 0.01). Mutagenicity was associated with longer periods of denture usage (P 0.007). Thus, denture poly(methyl methacrylate) base material can adsorb mutagenic substances, possibly from diet and tobacco, which are extractable by ethanol. Theoretically, the in situ alcoholic desorption and recirculation of carcinogenic mutagens may have a contributory role in certain cases of intra-oral and upper alimentary tract carcinogenesis.",Is acrylic dentures mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

Adsorbate was extracted from activated carbon with benzene, and then with ethanol. Although the benzene extract was not mutagenic, the ethanol one showed the mutagenic activity for Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 with and without S9 mix. The ethanol extract was much more mutagenic on TA100 than TA98 both with and without S9 mix.

617,"Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) combined with sulfuric acid is a strongly oxidizing mixture which has been recommended for the destruction and the decontamination of various mutagens/carcinogens in the publication series of the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Evaluation of the genotoxicity of 4 potassium permanganate solutions was performed using a microtechnique of the Ames test with the tester strains TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102 with and without metabolic activation. Presence of direct-acting mutagens was detected in all the samples with the tester strain TA102 without S9 mix (163-357 revertants/microliters of the solutions). Three samples containing either acetone or ethanol as an organic solvent also induced a mutagenic response on tester strain TA100 without S9 mix (167-337 revertants/microliters). In addition, DNA damage in human peripheral blood lymphocytes was also measured for one of the mixtures by a new technique: the single-cell gel assay (SCGA). A sample with no organic solvent induced DNA damage in human lymphocytes with a dose-response relationship as determined by SCGA. The major mutagenic agent generated by the permanganate solutions was found to be manganese ion (Mn2+). Both manganese sulfate (MnSO4) and manganese chloride (MnCl2) gave mutagenic dose-response relationships on tester strain TA102 without S9 mix. The mutagenic potencies were 2.8 and 2.4 revertant/nmole for MnSO4 and MnCl2 respectively. MnCl2 also induced DNA damage in human lymphocytes as determined by the SCGA. The genotoxic effects of KMnO4 in acidic conditions were probably mediated by the conversion of MnO4- to Mn2+. KMnO4 in alkaline solutions did not produce mutagenic species and may offer an alternative for the degradation of genotoxic compounds.",Is Potassium permanganate mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False

The organic solvents dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (MP) inhibit this mutagenicity, apparently because they inhibit DMN demethylase activity (assayed as formaldehyde production). Ellagic acid, dissolved in DMSO or MP, had no inhibitory effect on DMN mutagenicity, beyond the effect of the solvent vehicle.",Is Dimethylnitrosamine mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
619,"Three structurally related compounds, 4-acetoxy-3-acetoxy-methyl-acetophenone (AAMAP), 1-[4'-hydroxy-3'-hydroxy-methylphenyl]-2-[benzyl-t-butylamino] ethanone hydrochloride (HHBEH) and 1-[4'-hydroxy-3'-hydroxymethyl-phenyl]-2-[benzyl-t-butylamino] ethanol (HHBE), gave positive dose-related mutagenic responses in the Ames test when Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 was used as the test organism. Strain TA100 carries the hisG46 allele, which is revertable by base changes, together with plasmid pKM101, which encodes mucAB genes that are analogous to umuDC, the chromosomal SOS-repair genes of Escherichia coli K-12. None of the compounds was mutagenic in Ames strain TA1535, which is the plasmid-free derivative of strain TA100. Only AAMAP, and that at only the highest concentration tested, was mutagenic in strain TA98, which detects frameshift mutations and carries plasmid pKM101. No compound was significantly mutagenic in strain TA1538, which is the plasmid-free derivative of strain TA98. When the three compounds were tested for the induction of sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in Chinese hamster cells, the two more potent mutagens, AAMAP and HHBEH were found to increase SCEs, whereas HHBE did not give a significant response at any concentration tested. Ames test data showing plasmid pK101-dependent mutagenesis are therefore, at least for these compounds, relevant indicators of eukaryotic genotoxicity.",Is 4-acetoxy-3-acetoxy-methyl-acetophenone mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or pKM101 strain?,True
620,"The influence of organic solvents on the mutagenicity of 11 N-nitrosamines was examined in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 using the Ames's liquid incubation assay in the presence of rat-liver S9. The mutagenic activities of N-nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosodiethylamine, 6 oxidative derivatives of N-nitrosopropylamine and N-nitroso-2,6-dimethylmorpholine were considerably decreased by addition of dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl formamide, acetone, 95% ethanol or acetonitrile, which are recommended for use as solvents in the assay by Ames's group, to the incubation mixture. The mutagenic activities of N-nitrosodipropylamine and N-nitrosodibutylamine, which are barely soluble in water, were also suppressed by increasing concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide. These organic solvents did not appear to exert their influence by desmutagenic and antimutagenic actions. In contrast, the recoveries of unmetabolized carcinogens from preincubation mixtures and from agar plates were significantly higher in the presence of organic solvents than in their absence. The results indicate that the inhibitory effect is a result of interference with the process of metabolic activation by liver S9.",Is N-nitrosamines mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
621,"Five kinds of coffee samples were prepared from a commercial drip-grind coffee in order to examine the mutagenicity of brewed coffee using the Ames test. The samples prepared were a thick coffee syrup, coffee solid residues, dichloromethane and ethanol extracts of solid residues, a dichloromethane extract of a distillate from normally heated brewed coffee and dichloromethane extracts of distillates from overheated (150-300 degrees C) brewed coffee. The samples were tested for mutagenicity towards Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 both with and without metabolic activation (S-9 mix). Only the extracts of the distillates obtained from coffee heated to 150 degrees or 300 degrees C exhibited mutagenicity towards strain TA98 with S-9 mix.",Is coffee mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
622,"In a comparative study on 135 compounds of various chemical classes, 30 agents inducing direct nonreparable DNA damage in repair-deficient E. coli failed in reverting strains TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98 and TA100 of S. typhimurium (De Flora et al., 1984b). These compounds were re-assayed in the Ames test using strains TA97 and TA102. A dose-dependent mutagenic response was detected with aminoantipyrine and p-rosaniline in TA97 and with streptomycin and formaldehyde in TA102. p-Rosaniline was the only mutagen requiring metabolic activation. 5 compounds, i.e. o-aminophenol in TA97 and methanol, ethanol, cadmium chloride and cadmium sulfate in TA102, induced a reproducible increase in revertants over controls, but this was less than 2-fold. The remaining 21 chemicals--including amino compounds, aliphatics, aromatics, heterocycles, hydrazine derivatives and inorganics--confirmed their inactivity in the Ames test. Overall data for 135 compounds, comparing the Ames test (7 strains) and the DNA-repair test (3 strains), are re-assessed on the basis of these findings.",Is o-aminophenol mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,True
623,"A new hair-dye ingredient, 2-(2',4'-diaminophenoxy)ethanol (2,4-DAPE), was described as being devoid of any genotoxic activity on the basis of a multi-laboratory study. Since 2,4-DAPE is a close analogue of 2,4-diaminoanisole (2,4-DAA), which is mutagenic and carcinogenic, we tested this claim by assaying 2,4-DAPE for bacterial mutagenicity. Two samples of 2,4-DAPE X 2HCl were synthesized by reduction of the corresponding dinitrophenoxyethanol and identity and purity were established by elemental analysis, NMR spectrometry, mass-spectrometry, UV-spectrophotometry, TLC and HPLC. Fresh aqueous solutions of 2,4-DAPE X 2HCl were assayed in several separate plate tests using S. typhimurium TA1538, TA97, TA98 and TA100, and E. coli WP2uvrA (pKM101), 3 plates per dose and 0%, 4%, 10% and 30% Aroclor 1254-induced rat-liver S9 in S9 mixes. We obtained negative results in TA100 and E. coli. Reproducible, statistically significant dose-related increases in revertants (up to 14 times the background) were obtained in frame-shift mutants of S. typhimurium in the dose range 10-80 micrograms per plate. Mutagenicity was S9-dependent, significant increases in revertants being obtained only with 50 microliter per plate or more of S9. 2,4-DAPE induced significant mutagenic effects at doses of less than 1 micrograms per ml in TA1538 and TA98 in fluctuation tests using 2% S9 in the S9 mix. In plate tests, 2,4-DAPE was less mutagenic (by a factor of about 8) than 2,4-DAA, which gave the highest mutant yields with 20 microliter S9 per plate (4% S9 in the S9 mix). 2,4-DAPE obtained commercially was about 8 times more mutagenic than our sample of 2,4-DAPE. After purification, the commercial product, now chromatographically identical with our own sample, gave plate-test results close to those obtained for our samples of 2,4-DAPE. A review of the published reports (in which 2,4-DAPE was claimed to be inactive in a variety of short-term tests) revealed: (a) the use of protocols for bacterial mutagenicity testing which, in the light of our own results, were probably too limited in scope, especially in the choice of conditions for metabolic activation; (b) insufficient information on the identification and purity of the samples of 2,4-DAPE tested in the published collaborative study.","Is 2,4-DAPE mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or pKM101 or WP2uvrA strain?",True
624,"The hair-dye coupler 2,4-diaminophenoxyethanol was tested for mutagenicity in the histidine-requiring mutants of Salmonella typhimurium (TA1535, TA100, TA1537, TA1538 and TA98). The tests were carried out in the absence and presence of uninduced as well as an Aroclor-1254-induced rat-liver microsomal activation system. In the absence and presence of uninduced S9 this compound was not mutagenic in all strains used. Negative results were also obtained in the presence of an Aroclor-1254-induced rat-liver microsomal activation system. The mutagenic activity of this compound was also investigated in 2 systems of yeast, the gene conversion system with strain D4 and the reversion system with strain XV185-14C. In the absence and presence of metabolic activation, no mutagenic effect was observed.","Is 2,4-diaminophenoxyethanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?",False
625,"The mutagenicity of 2-(2',4'-diaminophenoxy)ethanol (2,4-DAPE) was compared with that of 2,4-diaminoanisole (2,4-DAA), a chemically related compound previously used in hair-dye formulations. Both chemicals were tested in standard procedures with the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test as described by Ames and colleagues. In several experiments, which extended over a total period of 2 years, 2,4-DAA exhibited definite, but variable mutagenicity toward strain TA1538 when S9 preparations of rat liver induced with Aroclor 1254 were present in the incubation mixtures. The compound 2,4-DAPE did not exhibit detectable mutagenic activity when tested concomitantly under the same experimental conditions. We conclude that 2,4-DAPE is not mutagenic for Salmonella under conditions of the standard mammalian microsome assay with strain TA1538 and TA98 as indicators.","Is 2,4-DAA mutagenic for TA98 strain?",True
626,"The activation of dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) to a bacterial mutagen in liver subcellular fraction and in intrasanguinous host-mediated assays was studied, in particular the effect of pretreatment of the animals with ethanol or acetone. Salmonella typhimurium TA 92 was much more sensitive to DMN mutagenicity than TA 100 and TA 1535 or Escherichia coli WP2uvrA and was used for the main part of the study. Noteworthy, in part already known, features of the in vitro activation are the relatively low pH optimum (pH 6-6.4), the non-linear dose-mutagenic response-relationship and the relatively high doses of DMN required for activation with control preparations. Pretreatment of mice with ethanol or acetone greatly reduced the minimal mutagenically effective concentration of DMN in the in vitro assay. Pretreatment with Aroclor 1254, an inducer frequently used in mutagenicity research, showed little effect when used alone, but reduced the potentiation by acetone. The results of the host-mediated assays substantially differed from those of the in vitro activation assays (a) in the relatively low dose of DMN required for mutagenicity to occur and (b) in the lack of potentiation by acetone-or ethanol-pretreatment. Acetone even led to a marginal decrease in mutagenicity. As a possible explantation for this apparent discrepancy were assume that with the in vitro system the activity of the dilute metabolizing system is limiting for the activation of DMN and induction therefore will increase the mutagenicity, whereas in vivo DMN is quantitatively metabolized in both induced and non-induced animals. The results show that caution has to be taken in the interpretation from in vitro results to the in vivo situation. In particular our in vivo experiments do not support the hypothesis that the induction by ethanol of an activating system with a low Km (which would strongly activate traces of DMN ingested with many foods) is one of the reasons for the increased risk of liver tumors in alcoholics.",Is dimethylnitrosamine mutagenic for WP2uvrA strain?,True
627,"The mutagenicity of 3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylic acid (5-NFA) for Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA100, TA98, TA1535 and TA1950 was studied by using the spot test, liquid-incubation test, microsomal assay, host-mediated assay and mutagenic analysis of blood and urine from treated mice. 5-NFA was dissolved in physiological saline or 10% ethanol. In the spot test, mutagenicity was found with TA100 and TA98 tester strains. A dose-related increase in mutation frequency was observed in the liquid-incubation test (at concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 micrograms 5-NFA/ml) with TA100 and TA1535; TA100 was the more sensitive. The use of ethanol reduced bacterial cell survival and increased the frequency of revertants. The Salmonella/microsomal assay showed no difference in mutagenic activity between the 5-NFA samples in tests with and without metabolic activation in vitro. In the host-mediated assay, mutagenicity of 5-NFA was detected after its applications in 3 fractionated doses. Subcutaneously applied 5-NFA was mutagenic after a total dose of 15 mg/kg, and after intragastric application of a total dose of 150 mg/kg. When blood samples from treated mice were analysed, the mutagenicity of 5-NFA at intragastric doses of 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg was observed for the tester strains TA100, TA98 and TA1950. The highest frequency of revertants was detected 15 or 30 min after administration of 5-NFA, the level being reached, according to the dose applied and strain used, after 1--2 h and confirmed in the course of 48 h. At the dose of 10 mg/kg, no mutagenic change was observed. Both tests on blood samples and host-mediated assay yielded identical results regardless of whether 5-NFA was dissolved in physiological saline or in 10% ethanol. Experiments in which mutagenic activity in urine was analysed demonstrated the mutagenicity of 5-NFA at the dose of 150 mg/kg with maxima after 24 and 48 h.",Is 5-NFA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
628,"We have previously described a very sensitive and efficient bacterial test designed to detect chemical carcinogens as mutagens. Chloroacetaldehyde is mutagenic in this system and is of interest because it is a possible metabolite in mammals of the large volume industrial chemicals 1,2-dichloroethane (ethylene dichloride) (3.5 billion kg/yr, U.S.) and vinyl chloride (2.5 billion kg/yr, U.S.), and of the antineoplastic agent cyclophosphamide. Chloroacetaldehyde reverts a new Salmonella bacterial tester strain (TA100). Chloroacetaldehyde is shown to be hundreds of times more effective in reversion of TA100 than is chloroethanol (ethylene chlorohydrin), a known metabolic precursor of chloroacetaldehyde and a possible metabolite of dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, or than vinyl chloride, which is itself mutagenic for TA100. Chloroethanol is shown to be activated by rat (or human) liver homogenates to a more highly mutagenic form with reversion properties similar to chloroacetaldehyde. Reversion properties of cyclophosphamide after in vitro metabolic activation suggest that chloroacetaldehyde is not the active mutagenic form of this antineoplastic drug.",Is Chloroacetaldehyde mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
629,"Acylfulvenes are a class of antitumor agents derived from illudin S, a sesquiterpenoid toxin isolated from mushrooms of the genus Omphalotus. Although DNA appears to be their major target, no data concerning mutagenicity of acylfulvenes are available in the literature, and limited data have been published on illudin S. Enzyme-mediated biotransformations have been demonstrated to influence the cytotoxicity of acylfulvenes. Illudin S and some acylfulvenes [e.g., (-)-6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (HMAF)] are allylic alcohols with potential for enhanced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity by means of metabolic sulfation. Therefore, we studied the influence of various heterologously expressed human sulfotransferases (SULTs) on biological activities of illudin S and HMAF in bacterial and mammalian cells. (-)-Acylfulvene (AF) was tested as a congener lacking an allylic hydroxyl group. We found: (1) all three compounds were mutagenic in standard Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100 and TA104; (2) they induced gene mutations (at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase locus) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in Chinese hamster V79 cells; (3) these effects were practically unaffected when human SULTs were expressed in the target bacteria or mammalian cells (using SCE as the endpoint); (4) illudin S demonstrated 40-600 times higher genotoxic activities than the semisynthetic acylfulvenes studied; it was positive in the SCE test even at a concentration of 0.3 nM; (5) genotoxicity in mammalian cells was observed at substantially lower concentrations of the compounds than required for a positive result in the bacterial test (400 nM with illudin S). We conclude that illudin S, HMAF and AF are potent genotoxicants and human SULTs do not play a significant role in their bioactivation. ",Is Acylfulvenes mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
630,"The cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and mutagenicity of 1-chloro-2-hydroxy-3-butene (CHB), a known in vitro metabolite of the human carcinogen 1,3-butadiene, have not previously been investigated. Because CHB can be bioactivated by alcohol dehydrogenases to yield 1-chloro-3-buten-2-one (CBO), a bifunctional alkylating agent that caused globin-chain cross-links in erythrocytes, in the present study we investigated the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of CHB and CBO in human normal hepatocyte L02 cells using the MTT assay, the relative cloning efficiency assay and the comet assay. We also investigated the mutagenic potential of these compounds with the Ames test using Salmonella strains TA1535 and TA1537. The results provide clear evidence for CHB and CBO being both cytotoxic and genotoxic with CBO being approximately 100-fold more potent than CHB. Interestingly, CHB generated both single-strand breaks and alkali-labile sites on DNA, whereas CBO produced only alkali-labile sites. CHB did not directly result in DNA breaks, whereas CBO was capable of directly generating breaks on DNA. Interestingly, both compounds did not induce DNA cross-links as examined by the comet assay. The Ames test results showed that CHB induced point mutation but not frameshift mutation, whereas the toxic effects of CBO made it difficult to reliably assess the mutagenic potential of CBO in the two strains. Collectively, the results suggest that CHB and CBO may play a role in the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of 1,3-butadiene.

631,"1-Methoxy-3-indolylmethyl (1-MIM) glucosinolate, present at substantial levels in several food crops (e.g., broccoli and cabbage), forms DNA adducts in vitro and is mutagenic to bacterial and mammalian cells after activation by the plant enzyme myrosinase. Moreover, a breakdown product, 1-MIM alcohol, is metabolized to a secondary reactive intermediate by some mammalian sulfotransferases (SULTs). First, we incubated herring-sperm DNA with 1-MIM glucosinolate in the presence of myrosinase. We identified and synthesized the predominant adducts, N(2)-(1-MIM)-dG and N(6)-(1-MIM)-dA, and developed an UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method for their specific detection using isotopic dilution. Second, we demonstrated both DNA adducts in target cells (Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and Chinese hamster V79) of standard mutagenicity tests treated with 1-MIM glucosinolate/myrosinase as well as in 1-MIM alcohol-treated Salmonella and V79 cells engineered for expression of human SULT1A1. Similar excesses of N(2)-(1-MIM)-dG over N(6)-(1-MIM)-dA adducts were found in all cellular models independent of the test compound (1-MIM glucosinolate or alcohol), whereas dA adducts predominated in the cell-free system. Finally, we detected both DNA adducts in colon tissue of a mouse orally treated with 1-MIM glucosinolate. We are going to use this specific and sensitive method for investigating genotoxic risks of food-borne exposure to 1-MIM glucosinolate in animal and human studies.",Is 1-MIM mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
632,"Furfuryl alcohol, formed by acid- and heat-induced dehydration from pentoses, is found in many foodstuffs. It induced renal tubule neoplasms in male B6C3F1 mice and nasal neoplasms in male F344/N rats in a study of the National Toxicology Program (NTP). However, furfuryl alcohol was negative in the standard Ames test and in a battery of in vivo mutagenicity tests. Here, we show that furfuryl alcohol is mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 engineered for expression of human sulfotransferase (SULT) 1A1. This finding suggests that furfuryl alcohol is converted by intracellular sulfo conjugation to 2-sulfo-oxymethylfuran, an electrophile reacting with DNA. We detected nucleoside adducts of 2'-deoxyadenosine, 2'-deoxyguanosine and 2'-deoxycytidine in porcine liver DNA incubated with freshly prepared 2-sulfo-oxymethylfuran. The main adducts, N(2)-((furan-2-yl)methyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine (N(2)-MFdG) and N(6)-((furan-2-yl)methyl)-2'-deoxyadenosine (N(6)-MFdA) were synthesized. Their structures were verified by NMR and mass spectrometry. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods for the quantification of both adducts were devised. N(2)-MFdG and N(6)-MFdA were detected in DNA of furfuryl alcohol-exposed S.typhimurium TA100 expressing SULT1A1 and in DNA of liver, lung and kidney of FVB/N mice that had received ∼390 mg furfuryl alcohol/kg body wt/day via the drinking water for 28 days. In summary, furfuryl alcohol is converted by sulfo conjugation to a mutagen. The detection of N(2)-MFdG and N(6)-MFdA in renal DNA of furfuryl alcohol-treated mice suggests that the neoplasms observed in this tissue in the study of the NTP may have been induced by 2-sulfo-oxymethylfuran.",Is Furfuryl alcohol mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
633,"Sesquiterpenic compounds are natural chemicals present in organisms from different Phylae or Divisions, which have proved to be important bioactive products, namely in potentiating the action of antibiotics. In the first step, the mutagenicity of nine sesquiterpenic compounds (hydrocarbons and alcohols) was screened in a Salmonella typhimurium his(-)-reversion test with strains TA98 and TA100, in the presence or absence of in vitro metabolic activation. Under the test conditions, none of the compounds showed mutagenicity up to a concentration of 222μg/plate. trans-Farnesol, nerolidol, and α-bisabolol displayed cytotoxicity when tested at concentrations ranging from 14 to 222μg/plate. Then, the combined effect of antibiotic-sesquiterpenic compounds was evaluated on two clinically relevant pathogens, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, with well-defined resistance-sensitive profiles. The agar-disc diffusion assay revealed that all the combinations of antibiotic-sesquiterpenic compounds increased the antibacterial activity of the antibiotics tested against S. aureus. For E. coli, an antagonistic effect was observed for various combinations on the growth of this bacterium.",Is Sesquiterpenic mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
634,"Allyl acetate, allyl alcohol, and acrolein are used in the manufacture of detergents, plastics, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals and as agricultural agents and food additives. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F(1) mice received allyl acetate, allyl alcohol, or acrolein by gavage for 14 weeks. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Drosophila melanogaster, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, rat bone marrow erythrocytes, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were administered 0, 6, 12, 25, 50, or 100 mg allyl acetate/kg body weight, 0, 1.5, 3, 6, 12, or 25 mg/kg allyl alcohol, or 0, 0.75, 1.25, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg acrolein in 0.5% methylcellulose by gavage, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were administered 0, 8, 16, 32, 62.5, or 125 mg/kg allyl acetate, 0, 3, 6, 12, 25, or 50 mg/kg allyl alcohol, or 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg acrolein in 0.5% methylcellulose by gavage, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. In the allyl acetate rat study, all males and females in the 100 mg/kg groups died or were killed moribund by day 8; there were no other deaths. In the allyl alcohol study, all rats survived to the end of the study except one 6 mg/kg female. In the acrolein rat study, eight males and eight females in the 10 mg/kg groups died by week 9 of the study. Two males in the 2.5 and 5 mg/kg groups and one or two females in the 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg groups also died early; two of these deaths were gavage accidents. In the allyl acetate mouse study, all males and females in the 125 mg/kg group died during the first week of the study. All other early deaths, except five 62.5 mg/kg males and one 32 mg/kg female, were gavage accidents. In the allyl alcohol mouse study, one 50 mg/kg female died due to a gavage accident; all other animals survived to the end of the study. In the acrolein mouse study, all males and females administered 20 mg/kg died during the first week of the study. All other early deaths, except one male and one female administered 10 mg/kg, were unrelated to chemical administration. The concentration of 3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid (3-HPM) in the urine of rats and mice was determined after the first dose of chemical and at the end of the 14-week study. At both time points, the concentrations of 3-HPM in the urine of animals that received allyl acetate or allyl alcohol increased linearly with dose. In animals dosed with acrolein, the concentrations of 3-HPM exhibited a nonlinear increase with dose at the first time point. At the end of the study, the concentration of 3-HPM in the urine of animals dosed with acrolein was linear with dose except at the highest concentration administered. Since urine volumes were not recorded during the urine collection, complete quantitation of these data was not possible. The final mean body weights and mean body weight gains of male rats administered 12 or 50 mg/kg allyl acetate and of male and female rats administered 10 mg/kg acrolein were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls. The mean body weight gain of male mice in the 50 mg/kg group in the allyl alcohol study was also less than that of the vehicle controls. Final mean body weights and mean body weight gains of dosed female rats and male and female mice in the allyl acetate studies, male and female rats and female mice in the allyl alcohol studies, and male and female mice in the acrolein studies were generally similar to those of the respective vehicle controls. Clinical findings related to allyl acetate administration included pallor, eye or nasal discharge, ruffled fur, lethargy, diarrhea, and thinness among rats in the 100 mg/kg groups and lethargy, abnormal breathing, thinness, and ruffled fur among mice that died early. In the acrolein study, clinical findings included abnormal breathing, eye or nasal discharge, ruffled fur, thinness, and lethargy in rats in the 10 mg/kg groups. The liver weights of male rats administered 25 mg/kg allyl alcohol, female rats administered 50 mg/kg allyl acetate or 5 or 10 mg/kg acrolein, and male mice administered 10 mg/kg acrolein were significantly greater than those of the vehicle controls. Female rats administered 10 mg/kg acrolein had significantly lower absolute and relative thymus weights than did the vehicle controls. Female rats administered 25 mg/kg allyl alcohol spent more time in diestrus and less time in metestrus than the vehicle controls. The estrous cycles of female mice dosed with 16 or 32 mg/kg allyl acetate were significantly longer than that of the vehicle controls. Gross lesions related to allyl acetate treatment were observed in the liver, forestomach, and thorax/abdomen of male and female rats in the 100 mg/kg groups. Microscopically, the incidences of forestomach squamous epithelial hyperplasia were significantly increased in male rats administered 12 mg/kg or greater, female rats administered 25 or 50 mg/kg, male mice administered 32 or 62.5 mg/kg, and female mice administered 16, 32, or 62.5 mg/kg. Forestomach necrosis, hemorrhage, and inflammation were present in most rats in the 100 mg/kg groups, and the incidence of hemorrhage in 125 mg/kg male mice was increased; male mice in the 62.5 and 125 mg/kg groups and 125 mg/kg female mice had significantly increased incidences of glandular stomach hemorrhage. Increased incidences of several liver lesions occurred in male or female rats administered 50 or 100 mg/kg, and to a lesser extent in 25 mg/kg rats, 62.5 mg/kg male mice, and 125 mg/kg male and female mice. Bone marrow hyperplasia, hemorrhage or depletion in the mediastinal, mandibular, and mesenteric lymph nodes, hemorrhage and necrosis of the thymus, and hematopoietic cell proliferation of the red pulp were also observed in 100 mg/kg rats. Increased incidences of necrosis in the mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus were observed in 62.5 and 125 mg/kg mice. Male and female rats administered 6 mg/kg allyl alcohol or greater and male and female mice administered 12 mg/kg allyl alcohol or greater had significantly increased incidences of squamous hyperplasia of the forestomach epithelium. Female rats in the 25 mg/kg group had significantly increased incidences of bile duct hyperplasia and periportal hepatocyte hypertrophy in the liver. Incidences of portal cytoplasmic vacuolization were significantly increased in 50 mg/kg male mice and female mice in the 25 and 50 mg/kg groups. Gross lesions related to acrolein treatment were observed in the forestomach and glandular stomach of male and female rats in the 10 mg/kg groups and 20 mg/kg female mice. Microscopically, the incidences of squamous hyperplasia of the forestomach epithelium were significantly increased in male rats in the 5 and 10 mg/kg groups, female rats administered 2.5 mg/kg or greater, and male and female mice administered 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg. Male and female rats in the 10 mg/kg groups and 20 mg/kg male and female mice had significantly increased incidences of glandular stomach hemorrhage. Female mice in the 20 mg/kg group also had significantly increased incidences of glandular stomach inflammation and epithelial necrosis. Allyl acetate was mutagenic in S. typhimurium strains TA100 and TA1535, in the absence of S9 activation. With S9, no mutagenicity was detected in these two strains; negative results were obtained in strains TA97 and TA98, with and without S9. Allyl alcohol was not mutagenic in four strains of S. typhimurium, with or without S9 metabolic activation. Acrolein, tested in a preincubation protocol, was weakly mutagenic in S. typhimurium strain TA100 in the presence of 10% induced rat liver S9. Equivocal results were obtained in strains TA100 and TA1535 with 10% induced hamster liver S9. Negative results were obtained with TA97, TA98, and TA1538 under all test conditions, and acrolein gave negative results in all four S. typhimurium strains tested for mutation induction under a vapor protocol. No induction of micronuclei was noted in bone marrow erythrocytes of male rats administered allyl acetate by gavage three times at 24-hour intervals. No significant increases in micronucleated erythrocytes were noted in bone marrow samples from male rats administered allyl alcohol by intraperitoneal injection for 3 days. A small, but significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes was observed in the peripheral blood of female mice administered allyl acetate by gavage for 14 weeks; no increase was observed in male mice. No increases in the frequencies of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes were observed in the peripheral blood of male or female mice administered allyl alcohol or acrolein by gavage for 14 weeks. Acrolein induced sister chromatid exchanges in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells in the absence, but not the presence, of S9; it did not induce chromosomal aberrations, with or without S9. Results of three independent Drosophila melanogaster sex linked recessive lethal tests in which acrolein was administered to adult flies via feeding or injection and to larvae via feeding were negative.",Is Allyl alcohol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
635,"2-Amino-4,6-dinitrobenzoic acid (2-A-4,6-DNBA), 4-amino-2,6-dinitrobenzoic acid (4-A-2,6-DNBA), 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid (2,4,6-TNBA), 2-amino-4, 6-dinitrobenzylalcohol (2-A-4,6-DNBAlc), 4-amino-2,6-dinitrobenzylalcohol (4-A-2,6-DNBAlc), 2,4-dinitrotoluol-5-sulfonic acid (2,4-DNT-5-SA), 2,4-dinitrotoluol-3-sulfonic acid (2,4-DNT-3-SA), and 2, 4-dinitrobenzoic acid (2,4-DNBA) are derivatives of nitro-explosives that have been detected in groundwater close to munitions facilities. In the present study, the genotoxicity of these compounds was evaluated in Salmonella/microsome assays (in strains TA100 and TA98, with and without S9 and in TA98NR without S9), in chromosomal aberration (CA) tests with Chinese hamster fibroblasts (V79), and in micronucleus (MN) assays with human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. All compounds except the sulfonic acids were positive in the bacterial mutagenicity tests, with 2,4,6-TNBA producing the strongest response (8023 revertants/micromol in TA98 without S9 activation). 2-A-4,6-DNBA was a direct acting mutagen in TA98, but negative in TA100. The other positive compounds were approximately 1-3 orders of magnitude less mutagenic than 2,4,6-TNBA in TA98 and in TA100; relatively strong effects ( approximately 50-400 revertants/micromol) were produced by the benzylacohols in the two indicator strains. With the exception of 2,4-DNBA, the mutagenic responses were lower in the nitroreductase-deficient strain TA98NR than in the parental strain. 2,4-DNBA produced a marginally positive response in the V79-cell CA assay; the other substances were devoid of activity. Only the benzoic acids were tested for MN induction in HepG2 cells, and all produced positive responses. As in the bacterial assays, the strongest effect was seen with 2,4,6-TNBA (significant induction at >or=1.9 microM). 4-A-2,6-DNBA was positive at 432 microM; the weakest effect was observed with 2,4,-DNBA (positive at >or=920 microM). The differences in the sensitivity of the indicator cells to these agents can be explained by differences in the activities of enzymes involved in the activation of the compounds. The strong responses produced by some of the compounds in the human-derived cells suggest that environmental exposure to these breakdown products of nitro-explosives may pose a cancer risk in man.",Is sulfonic acids mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
636,"alpha-Bisabolol (BISA) is a sesquiterpene alcohol found in the oils of chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) and other plants. BISA has been widely used in dermatological and cosmetic formulations. This study was undertaken to investigate the mutagenicity and antimutagenicity of BISA in the Salmonella/microsome assay. Mutagenicity of BISA was evaluated with TA100, TA98, TA97a and TA1535 Salmonella typhimurium strains, without and with addition of S9 mixture. No increase in the number of his+ revertant colonies over the negative (solvent) control values was observed with any of the four tester strains. In the antimutagenicity assays, BISA was tested up to the highest nontoxic dose (i.e. 50 and 150 microg/plate, with and without S9 mix, respectively) against direct-acting (sodium azide, SA; 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, 4-NQNO; 2-nitrofluorene, 2-NF; and nitro-o-phenylenediamine, NPD) as well as indirect-acting (cyclophosphamide, CP; benzo[a]pyrene, B[a]P; aflatoxin B1, AFB1; 2-aminoanthracene, 2-AA; and 2-aminofluorene, 2-AF) mutagens. BISA did not alter mutagenic activity of SA and of NPD, and showed only a weak inhibitory effect on the mutagenicity induced by 4-NQNO and 2-NF. The mutagenic effects of AFB1, CP, B[a]P, 2-AA and 2-AF, on the other hand, were all markedly and dose-dependently reduced by BISA. It was also found that BISA inhibited pentoxyresorufin-o-depentylase (PROD, IC50 2.76 microM) and ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD, 33.67 microM), which are markers for cytochromes CYP2B1 and 1A1 in rat liver microsomes. Since CYP2B1 converts AFB1 and CP into mutagenic metabolites, and CYP1A1 activates B[a]P, 2-AA and 2-AF, results suggest that BISA-induced antimutagenicity could be mediated by an inhibitory effect on the metabolic activation of these promutagens.",Is BISA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
637,"Sulfonic acid esters are considered as potentially alkylating agents that may exert genotoxic effects in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. One possible source of human exposure stems from drug synthesis when the salt-forming agents methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid are used together with alcoholic solvents such as methanol, ethanol and propanol. In this study computer-assisted structural considerations and in vitro approaches (Ames mutagenicity test using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100, and the micronucleus test using L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells) were used to assess the genotoxic properties of 19 sulfonic esters. While all esters may be principally active as genotoxicants based on the presence of the sulfonate moiety, the statistical correlative multiple computer automated structure evaluation (MCASE) system (MC4PC version 1.0) using the Ames mutagenicity A2I module (version 1.54), rank-ordered the activity of the benzenesulfonic acid esters in the Ames test negligible due to an inactivating modulator and a deactivating fragment, whereas the methane- and toluenesulfonic acid esters were predicted to be positive in this test. In the Ames test, with the exception of the p-toluenesulfonic acid ethyl and iso-butyl esters, all compounds came out positive in Salmonella strain TA100. Methanesulfonic iso-propyl, sec-butyl and benzenesulfonic acid iso-propyl ester also showed mutagenic potential in strain TA98. In general, differences between results seen in Ames tests performed with or without metabolic activation were rather small. In L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, benzenesulfonic acid n- and iso-butyl ester and p-toluenesulfonic acid iso-butyl ester did not increase the number of cells containing micronuclei. The other esters were positive in this micronucleus test; however, methanesulfonic acid iso-butyl ester was found to be only weakly positive at excessively cytotoxic concentrations. These compounds were generally found to be more potent with regard to micronucleus induction when tested without metabolic activation (20 h treatment). In conclusion, the iso-propyl esters of the three sulfonic acids under study were found to be the strongest mutagens, either when tested in the Ames test or the micronucleus assay, whereas p-toluenesulfonic acid iso-butyl ester was the only compound shown to be devoid of a genotoxic potential in both tests.",Is Sulfonic acid esters mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
638,"Cyracure UVR 6105 is a cycloaliphatic epoxy monomer and has both carboxylate and epoxy groups, with the potential for rapid polymerization. It is widely used in industry for the preparation of inks, resins, coatings, and was proposed for incorporation into dental composites. The objective of this study was to determine the mutagenic potential of this chemical related to its metabolite products. Several doses of Cyracure UVR 6105 were dissolved in DMSO and subjected to the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. A metabolic activation system (S9-mix) was used consisting of Arochlor-induced liver S9 homogenate enriched with NADP and glucose-6-phosphate cofactors. In contrast to studies without S9-mix, Cyracure UVR 6105 exhibited enhanced genotoxic activities with strains TA100 and TA1535 in the presence of liver S9-mix. From in vitro metabolism of Cyracure UVR 6105 with S9-mix, as used in the Ames assay, several metabolites were identified. The alcohol metabolite, 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethanol, containing intact epoxy group was identified in the organic solvent extract. This metabolite was synthesized and proved to be mutagenic against TA100 when assayed in the presence and absence of S9-mix. Results showed that the increased mutagenicity of Cyracure UVR-6105 in the presence of liver enzymes is due to the formation of the mutagenic metabolite 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethanol.",Is Cyracure UVR 6105 mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
639,"Toxicity of an alcohol-free hydro-alcoholic grape skin extract (GSE) obtained from red grapes Vitis labrusca (Isabel varietal) that present antihypertensive, vasodilator and antioxidant effects was estimated by different bioassays. Using the Salmonella/microsome assay for strains TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102 no mutagenicity was detected for all tested concentrations (0.1-100 microg/ml), even with metabolization. Nevertheless, cytotoxicity was observed for TA97 and TA102 with and without metabolization and for TA100 with metabolization. The measurement of beta-galactosidase induction in the SOS-chromotest was positive only for Escherichia coli PQ37 when metabolization enzymes were present. Using Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts, DNA strand breaks induction by GSE was also investigated by the comet assay and no significative difference was detected for treated and no treated DNA for 60 min. Our data suggest that GSE although no mutagenic presents cytotoxic activity.",Is grape skin extract mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
640,"Ocotea duckei Vattimo is a plant popularly known as ""louro-de-cheiro"" found in the northeast of Brazil. Traditional medicinal uses of this plant are not known, but recent pharmacological studies with the isolated major constituent yangambin have shown various qualities: platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonist, protective effects against cardiovascular collapse and anaphylactic shock, anti-allergic properties, analgesic activity, and depressant effect in the central nervous system. In this work, the Ames test was used to evaluate the mutagenic potential of the hydroalcoholic extract of O. duckei leaves and of yangambin. Using TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102 and TA1535 strains of Salmonella typhimurium, positive results were obtained only with the hydroalcoholic extract, with or without metabolic activation. Yangambin was not mutagenic, which is of interest due to its pharmacological properties.",Is Ocotea duckei Vattimo mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 strain?,False
641,"Chloral hydrate is widely used as a sedative and a hypnotic in pediatric medicine. It is also a byproduct of water chlorination. Chloral hydrate has been shown to be genotoxic in numerous prokaryotic and eukaryotic assay systems including human lymphocytes in vitro. One of its metabolites, trichloroacetic acid, has demonstrated hepatocarcinogenic activity in mice. Trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene, both of which are metabolized to chloral hydrate, have been shown to be carcinogenic in rats and/or mice. Because of this evidence of carcinogenicity and because of the wide-spread use of chloral hydrate, 16- or 17-day range-finding toxicity studies and separate 16- or 17-day metabolism studies were performed in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice in preparation for further long-term rodent studies. In addition, in vitro studies of the metabolism and DNA-binding capacity of chloral hydrate and its metabolites were performed. Genetic toxicity studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, Drosophila melanogaster, and mouse bone marrow cells. For the range-finding studies, groups of eight male and eight female F344/N Nctr BR rats and B6C3F1/Nctr BR (C57BL/6N x C3H/HeN MTV-) mice were administered 0, 50, 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg chloral hydrate per kg body weight in water by gavage 5 days per week for 17 days (rats) or 16 days (mice) for a total of 12 doses. One male rat receiving 800 mg/kg died after five doses. Two 800 mg/kg female rats died after dosing ended but before study termination. One male mouse in each group except the 400 mg/kg group died before the end of the study. Two 800 mg/kg female mice also died before the end of the study. The final mean body weight of 800 mg/kg male rats and the mean body weight gains of 400 and 800 mg/kg males were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls. The mean body weight gains of all groups of dosed male mice were significantly greater than that of the vehicle control group. The only clinical finding in rats and mice attributed to chloral hydrate treatment was light sedation in the 400 mg/kg groups and heavy sedation in the 800 mg/kg groups; sedation subsided within 30 minutes or 3 hours, respectively. The liver weights of 400 mg/kg male mice and 800 mg/kg male and female mice were significantly greater than those of the vehicle control groups. No chemical-related lesions were observed in rats or mice. Male and female rats and mice were administered a single dose of 50 or 200 mg chloral hydrate per kg body weight in water by gavage, or 12 doses of 50 or 200 mg/kg over 17 days (rats) or 16 days (mice). Plasma concentrations of chloral hydrate and its metabolites were determined 15 minutes, 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours, and 2, 4, 8, and 16 days after receiving 1 or 12 doses. Maximum concentrations of chloral hydrate were observed at the initial sampling point of 15 minutes. By 1 hour, the concentrations had dropped substantially, and by 3 hours, chloral hydrate could not be detected in rats or mice. Trichloroacetic acid was the major metabolite detected in the plasma. In rats, the concentrations rose slowly, with the peaks occurring between 1 and 6 hours after treatment. In mice, the peak concentrations were found 1 hour after dosing. The concentrations then slowly decreased such that by 2 days the metabolite could no longer be detected in rats or mice. Trichloroethanol was assayed both as the free alcohol and its glucuronide. In rats, the maximum concentrations of free trichloroethanol occurred at 15 minutes, while the peak concentrations of trichloroethanol glucuronide were found at 1 hour; by 3 hours, concentrations of both metabolites approached background levels. In mice, the maximum concentrations of both metabolites occurred at 15 minutes, and by 1 to 3 hours concentrations approached background levels. The plasma concentrations of chloral hydrate and its metabolites were dose dependent in rats and mice. In mice, plasma concentrations of trichloroacetic acid were significantly higher after a single dose than after 12 doses. None of the metabolic parameters appears to account for species differences that may exist in hepatocarcinogenicity. The data from the study of metabolism and DNA adduct formation indicated that in vitro metabolism of 200 microM to 5 mM chloral hydrate by male B6C3F1 mouse liver microsomes (control microsomes) generated free radical intermediates that resulted in endogenous lipid peroxidation, forming malondialdehyde, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propionaldehyde. Similar concentrations of trichloroacetic acid and trichloroethanol, the primary metabolites of chloral hydrate, also generated free radicals and induced lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation induced by trichloroacetic acid nearly equaled that induced by chloral hydrate, while that from trichloroethanol was three- to fourfold less. Metabolism of 200 microM to 5 mM chloral hydrate, trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroethanol by liver microsomes of B6C3F1 mice pretreated with pyrazole (pyrazole-induced microsomes) yielded lipid peroxidation products at concentrations two- to threefold greater than those from liver microsomes of untreated mice. Additionally, chloral hydrate-induced lipid peroxidation catalyzed by control and pyrazole-induced microsomes was reduced significantly by 2,4-dichloro-6-phenylphenoxyethylamine, a general cytochrome P450 inhibitor. Human lymphoblastoid transgenic cells expressing cytochrome P(450)2E1 metabolized 200 to 5,000 micrograms/mL chloral hydrate to reactants inducing mutations, whereas the parental cell line was inactive. The malondialdehyde-modified DNA adduct, 3-(2-deoxy-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)pyrimido[1,2 alpha]purin-10(3H)-one (MDA-MG-1), formed from the metabolism of 1 mM chloral hydrate, trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroethanol by control B6C3F1 mouse liver microsomes, mouse pyrazole-induced microsomes, male F344/N rat liver microsomes, and human liver microsomes in the presence and absence of calf thymus DNA was also determined. When incubated in the absence of calf thymus DNA, the amount of malondialdehyde formed from metabolism by pyrazole-induced mouse microsomes was twice that from rat or human liver microsomes. Amounts of chloral hydrate-induced and trichloroacetic acid-induced lipid peroxidation products formed from metabolism by rat and human liver microsomes were similar, and these quantities were about twice those formed from the metabolism of trichloroethanol. The quantity of MDA-MG-1 formed from the metabolism of chloral hydrate, trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroethanol by mouse, rat, and human liver microsomes exhibited a linear correlation with the quantity of malondialdehyde formed under incubation conditions in the absence of calf thymus DNA. Chloral hydrate was shown to be mutagenic in vitro and in vivo. At doses from 1,000 to 10,000 micrograms/plate, it induced mutations in S. typhimurium strain TA100, with and without S9 activation; an equivocal response was obtained in S. typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of S9, and no mutagenicity was detected with strain TA1535 or TA1537. Chloral hydrate at doses from 1,700 to 5,000 micrograms/mL induced sister chromatid exchanges; at doses from 1,000 to 3,000 micrograms/mL, chromosomal aberrations were induced in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with and without S9. Results of a sex-linked recessive lethal test in D. melanogaster were unclear; administration of chloral hydrate by feeding produced an inconclusive increase in recessive lethal mutations, results of the injection experiment were negative. An in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test with chloral hydrate at doses from 125 to 500 mg/kg gave a positive dose trend. In summary, due to the absence of chloral hydrate-induced histopathologic lesions in rats and mice, no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) were based on body weights of rats and liver weights of mice. The NOAELs for rats and mice were 200 mg/kg. Chloral hydrate was rapidly metabolized by rats and mice, with trichloroacetic acid occurring as the major metabolite. Peak concentrations of trichloroacetic acid occurred more quickly in mice. Plasma concentrations of chloral hydrate were dose dependent, but metabolic rates were unaffected by dose or sex. Chloral hydrate was mutagenic in vitro and in vivo. Metabolism of chloral hydrate and its metabolites produced free radicals that resulted in lipid peroxidation in liver microsomes of mice, rats, and humans. Induction of cytochrome P(450)2E1 by pyrazole increased the concentrations of lipid peroxidation products; inhibition of cytochrome P(450)2E1 by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine reduced these concentrations. Metabolism of chloral hydrate and its metabolites by mouse, rat, and human liver microsomes formed malondialdehyde, and in the presence of calf thymus DNA formed the DNA adduct MDA-MG-1.",Is Chloral hydrate mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
642,"Methyl-tert-butylether (MTBE) is an oxygenate widely used in the United States as a motor vehicle fuel additive to reduce emissions and as an octane booster [National Research Council, Toxicological and Performance Aspects of Oxygenated Motor Vehicle Fules, National Academy Press, Washington, DC, 1996]. But it is the potential for MTBE to enter drinking water supplies that has become an area of public concern. MTBE has been shown to induce liver and kidney tumors in rodents but the biochemical process leading to carcinogenesis is unknown. MTBE was previously shown to be non-mutagenic in the standard Ames plate incorporation test with tester strains that detect frame shift (TA98) and point mutations (TA100) and in a suspension assay using TA104, a strain that detects oxidative damage, suggesting a non-genotoxic mechanism accounts for its carcinogenic potential. These strains are deficient in excision repair due to deletion of the uvrB gene. We hypothesized that the carcinogenic activity of MTBE may be dependent upon a functional excision repair system that attempts to remove alkyl adducts and/or oxidative base damage caused by direct interaction of MTBE with DNA or by its metabolites, formaldehyde and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), established carcinogens that are mutagenic in some Ames strains. To test our hypothesis, the genotoxicity of MTBE-induced DNA alterations was assayed using the standard Ames test with TA102, a strain similar to TA104 in the damage it detects but uvrB + and, therefore, excision repair proficient. The assay was performed (1) with and without Aroclor-induced rat S-9, (2) with and without the addition of formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH), and (3) with human S-9 homogenate. MTBE was weakly mutagenic when tested directly and moderately mutagenic with S-9 activation producing between 80 and 200 TA102 revertants/mg of compound. Mutagenicity was inhibited 25%-30% by FDH. TA102 revertants were also induced by TBA and by MTBE when human S-9 was substituted for rat S-9. We conclude that MTBE and its metabolites induce a mutagenic pathway involving oxidation of DNA bases and an intact repair system. These data are significant in view of the controversy surrounding public safety and the environmental release of MTBE and similar fuel additives.",Is MTBE mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
643,"The essential oils and their monoterpenoid constituents have been widely used as fragrances in cosmetics, as flavouring food additives, as scenting agents in a variety of household products, as active ingredients in some old drugs, and as intermediates in the synthesis of perfume chemicals. The present study was undertaken to investigate the mutagenic potential of six monoterpenoid compounds: two aldehydes (citral and citronellal), a ketone ((+/-)-camphor), an oxide (1,8-cineole, also known as eucalyptol), and two alcohols (terpineol and (-)-menthol). It is part of a more comprehensive toxicological screening of monoterpenes under way at our laboratory. Mutagenicity was evaluated by the Salmonella/microsome assay (TA97a, TA98, TA100 and TA102 tester strains), without and with addition of an extrinsic metabolic activation system (lyophilized rat liver S9 fraction induced by Aroclor 1254). In all cases, the upper limit of the dose interval tested was either the highest non-toxic dose or the lowest dose of the monoterpene toxic to TA100 strain in the preliminary toxicity test. No mutagenic effect was found with (+/-) camphor, citral, citronellal, 1,8-cineole, and (-) menthol. Terpineol caused a slight but dose-related increase in the number of his+ revertants with TA102 tester strain both without and with addition of S9 mixture. The results from this study therefore suggest that, with the exception of terpineol, the monoterpenoid compounds tested are not mutagenic in the Ames test.",Is camphor mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
644,"Urethane, a byproduct of fermentation found in alcoholic beverages, is carcinogenic in rodents and is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a possible human carcinogen. The United States Food and Drug Administration nominated urethane for study because of the widespread exposure of humans through the consumption of fermented foods and beverages and because of a lack of adequate dose-response data about the carcinogenicity of urethane with and without the coadministration of ethanol. Comparative studies of urethane in drinking water and in 5% ethanol were conducted to investigate possible effects of ethanol on urethane toxicity. Toxicokinetic studies of urethane in drinking water and in 5% ethanol and genetic toxicity studies of urethane in vivo and in vitro were also conducted. Groups of 10 male and 10 female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice, 6 weeks of age, received 0, 110, 330, 1,100, 3,300, or 10,000 ppm urethane in drinking water or in 5% ethanol for 13 weeks. Toxicokinetic evaluations were performed for urethane in the plasma of male mice after 13 weeks of administration in drinking water or 5% ethanol. The mutagenicity of urethane in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 with and without S9 was tested at doses up to 16,666 micrograms/plate; urethane was also tested for induction of sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells and sex-linked recessive lethal mutations and chromosomal reciprocal translocations in Drosophila melanogaster. The frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes induced in peripheral blood and bone marrow cells of mice by urethane in drinking water and in 5% ethanol was also evaluated. In rats that received urethane in drinking water, seven males and four females administered 10,000 ppm and one female administered 3,300 ppm died before the end of the study; body weight gains were reduced at these concentrations. Two males and all females given 10,000 ppm urethane in 5% ethanol died during the study, and the body weight gains of males and females that received 3,300 ppm were lower than those of the controls. Relative right kidney, liver, and lung weights of males and females and relative right testis weights of males administered 1,100 ppm or greater were generally higher than those of the controls in each study. Leukopenia and lymphopenia were observed in rats receiving urethane in either drinking water or ethanol and occurred in males receiving 330 ppm or greater and females receiving 110 ppm or greater. Other differences in hematology and clinical chemistry variables were not considered to be biologically significant. Lymphoid depletion of the spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus was observed in male and female rats receiving 1,100, 3,300, or 10,000 ppm urethane in drinking water. Cellular depletion of the bone marrow occurred in males and females in the 10,000 ppm groups. Hepatocellular fatty changes and clear cell foci of alteration were noted in the liver of males and females that received 3,300 or 10,000 ppm. The incidences of nephropathy were significantly increased in female rats that received 1,100 ppm or greater; the severity of this lesion in exposed males and females was greater than that in the controls. Females that received 330 ppm or greater had higher incidences of cardiomyopathy than the controls; the severity of this lesion was greater in males in the 10,000 ppm group and females in the 3,300 and 10,000 ppm groups than in the controls. In rats that received urethane in 5% ethanol, lymphoid depletion occurred in males and females in the 3,300 and 10,000 ppm groups. Cellular depletion of the bone marrow was observed in males and females in the 10,000 ppm groups. Only males in the 10,000 ppm group had hepatocellular fatty change (8/10) and clear cell foci (1/10); the incidence and severity of nephropathy in males and females and cardiomyopathy in males were similar to those in rats administered urethane in drinking water; however, no cardiomyopathy was observed in females receiving urethane in ethanol. The estrous cycle length of females receiving urethane in ethanol appeared to be longer than that of females receiving urethane in drinking water. Because cycle length was longer in the 10,000 ppm groups than in the controls in both the drinking water and ethanol vehicle studies, this difference may represent an exacerbation of the toxicity of urethane. A longer estrous cycle may be a sign of reproductive impairment and correlates with a decrease in female fecundity. All mice administered 10,000 ppm urethane in either vehicle died. All mice that received 3,300 ppm urethane in drinking water died, while only one male and four females receiving 3,300 ppm urethane in 5% ethanol died. Body weight gains of males and females in all 1,100 ppm groups were less than those of the respective controls, but the weight gains of mice receiving 1,100 ppm urethane in 5% ethanol were greater than those of mice receiving urethane in drinking water. The mean body weights of the lower exposure groups were similar to those of the respective controls, and there were no other differences between the body weights of mice receiving urethane in drinking water and those receiving urethane in 5% ethanol. Fluid consumption, and therefore total urethane intake, appeared lower in mice receiving the 5% ethanol vehicle than in those receiving the water vehicle. The relative right kidney, liver, and lung weights of males and females administered urethane in drinking water or ethanol were generally greater than those of the controls. Clearance of urethane from the plasma of male mice was complete within 2 hours after urethane was administered in water, but urethane was not cleared 12 hours after administration in 5% ethanol. At the end of 13 weeks of urethane administration, the plasma urethane elimination half-life was 0.8 hours; the kinetics were similar for concentrations of 110, 330, and 1,100 ppm urethane in water and in ethanol. However, at each exposure level, the plasma urethane concentration was four times greater for urethane administered in 5% ethanol than for urethane administered in drinking water, indicating a possible inhibition of urethane metabolism by ethanol. Kinetic measurements for elimination by female mice could not be obtained from the data collected. In mice administered urethane in drinking water, lung inflammation occurred in males and females that received 1,100 ppm or greater. Alveolar epithelial hyperplasia occurred in the lungs of males in the 330 and 1,100 ppm groups and females in the 1,100 ppm group; one male mouse in the 330 ppm group had an alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma (see the following summary table). Mice receiving urethane in 5% ethanol had lower incidences and severity of lung inflammation but generally greater incidences and severity of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia than mice receiving the same concentrations of urethane in drinking water. Alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas occurred in four males and one female administered urethane in ethanol. [table: see text] Nephropathy was observed in males and females that received urethane in either vehicle, and the lesions in female mice were more severe than those in male mice; ethanol did not appear to increase the incidence or severity of nephropathy. Cardiomyopathy occurred in males and females that received 1,100 or 3,300 ppm urethane in drinking water and in females that received 3,300 ppm urethane in ethanol. Lymphoid depletion occurred in mice that received 3,300 or 10,000 ppm urethane; 5% ethanol did not appear to enhance these effects. However, urethane in 5% ethanol induced ovarian atrophy; the incidence of this lesion was lower in females receiving urethane in drinking water. A concentration of 1,100 ppm urethane in either drinking water or ethanol effectively stopped estrous cycling. Urethane is clearly genotoxic in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, urethane induced mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535 in the presence of liver S9 enzymes. Sister chromatid exchanges were induced in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with and without S9. However, no induction of chromosomal aberrations was observed in CHO cells treated with urethane, with or without S9. In vivo, urethane induced sex-linked recessive lethal mutations and reciprocal translocations in germ cells of adult male Drosophila melanogaster fed urethane. Significantly increased frequencies of micronucleated erythrocytes were observed in peripheral blood obtained from male and female mice after 45 days of exposure and in bone marrow and peripheral blood obtained after 13 weeks of exposure to urethane in drinking water. There appeared to be no significant difference in the magnitude of the response in the peripheral blood micronucleus test between mice administered urethane in drinking water and mice administered urethane in 5% ethanol. In summary, concentrations of 1,100 ppm urethane or greater in drinking water caused lymphoid and bone marrow cell depletion and hepatocellular lesions and increased the severity of nephropathy and cardiomyopathy in male and female rats. The lethal effects of 10,000 ppm urethane were slightly exacerbated by 5% ethanol in female rats. Urethane administered in drinking water induced lung inflammation, alveolar and bronchiolar hyperplasia, alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas, nephropathy, cardiomyopathy, lymphoid and bone marrow cell depletion, seminiferous tubule degeneration, and ovarian atrophy and follicular degeneration in mice. In female mice, 5% ethanol appeared to exacerbate ovarian atrophy. Mice administered urethane in 5% ethanol consumed less fluid, and therefore less urethane, than mice receiving urethane in drinking water. Coadministration of urethane and ethanol inhibited the clearance of urethane from plasma. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",Is urethane mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
645,"Ortho-, meta- and para-nitrobenzyl bromides, alcohols, ethers and esters were synthesised and tested for their mutagenicity toward Salmonella typhimurium TA100, TA100NR (nitroreductase deficient) and TA98 in absence of S9 mix and in TA100 with S9 mix. Compounds of the ortho- and meta-series were non mutagenic with and without S9 mix. Except for the alcohol and ether, the compounds of the para-series were mutagenic in TA100 with activity sequence propionate > butyrate > benzoate > acetate > bromide and this specific activity was reduced considerably by S9 mix. The Ames Salmonella test system does not seem to be an appropriate model to evaluate mutagenicity of o-nitrobenzyls. However, further work is in progress to test all the compounds for mutagenicity in mammalian system.",Is para-nitrobenzyl bromides mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
646,"Human hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase, human phenol-sulfating form of phenol sulfotransferase, rat hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase a and rat phenol sulfotransferase IV were expressed in Escherichia coli. Cytosol preparations of transformed bacteria were used as activating systems in mutagenicity tests with Salmonella typhimurium TA98. All test compounds, 1-hydroxymethylpyrene, 2-hydroxymethylpyrene, 1-(1-pyrenyl)ethanol, 9-hydroxymethylanthracene, 7-hydroxymethyl-12-methylbenz[a]anthracene and 4H-cyclopenta[def]chrysen-4-ol, were activated by both hydroxysteroid sulfotransferases investigated. However, 1-(1-pyrenyl)ethanol was 67-fold more efficiently activated by the human enzyme, whereas 7-hydroxymethyl-12-methylbenz[a]anthracene was 27-fold more efficiently activated by the rat enzyme. The phenol sulfotransferases showed relatively low activities with the benzylic alcohols investigated. The only exception was 4H-cyclopenta[def]chrysen-4-ol, which was activated efficiently by rat phenol sulfotransferase IV. We had previously tested the ability of rat and human hepatic cytosol preparations to activate the same compounds. The results of a statistical analysis suggest that the activities of human hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase, rat hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase a and phenol sulfotransferase IV can account for a substantial portion of the activation of benzylic alcohols in human, female rat and male rat liver, respectively.",Is 1-(1-pyrenyl)ethanol mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
647,"1-Hydroxymethylpyrene (HMP), a primary benzylic alcohol, and 4H-cyclopenta[def]chrysen-4-ol (OH-CPC), a secondary benzylic alcohol, were investigated for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium (reversion of the his- strain TA98) in the presence of various xenobiotic-metabolizing systems. In the direct test, HMP was inactive and OH-CPC was very weakly active. In the presence of NADPH-fortified postmitochondrial fraction from rat liver (S9/NADPH), no activation of OH-CPC was observed, whereas strong mutagenic effects were elicited by HMP. In the presence of cytosol and 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), both alcohols were activated to potent mutagens. For equal mutagenic effects, approximately 650-fold lower concentrations of HMP were required in the cytosol/PAPS-mediated assay than in the S9/NADPH-mediated assay. The cytosol/PAPS-mediated mutagenicity of both alcohols was 3- to 4-fold enhanced, when KCl (125 mM) was present during the exposure. The authentic chloromethylarenes, 1-chloromethylpyrene and 4-chloro-4H-cyclopenta[def]chrysene, showed very strong direct mutagenicity. These results, taken together with previous findings, indicate that both primary and secondary benzylic alcohols derived from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may be activated by sulfotransferases to electrophilic sulfuric acid esters, and by subsequent substitution reaction to further active species such as benzylic chlorides.",Is 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
648,"Fecapentaenes form a class of potent fecal mutagens and have been suggested to play an initiating role in colon carcinogenesis. Although several indications have been found that fecapentaenes may induce oxidative DNA damage as well as DNA alkylation, the mechanism of genotoxicity remains unknown. In this study, electron spin resonance spectroscopy with several spin traps has been used in order to determine whether reactive oxygen species can be formed by fecapentaene-12 (FP-12). No specific conditions could be defined that resulted in the direct formation of oxygen radicals from FP-12. However, peroxidation of FP-12 by various peroxidative enzymes has been shown to result in the formation of superoxide adducts of the spin traps alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-t-butylnitrone and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO). Addition of superoxide dismutase resulted in a decreased spectrum intensity, whereas the hydroxyl radical scavenger t-butyl alcohol (tBA) appeared of no influence on the signal, both confirming the formation of superoxide. The formation of hydroxyl radical spin adducts has been demonstrated after peroxidation of FP-12 in incubations with the spin-trapping agent 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine (TMP). Further, the effects of scavenging hydroxyl radicals with respect to the genotoxic potential of FP-12 in the Salmonella mutagenicity assay has been investigated. It was clearly shown that radical scavenging reduced the number of revertants in Salmonella strains TA100, TA102 and TA104. This mutagenicity-reducing effect was more convincing using both spin traps DMPO and TMP as compared to the effect of hydroxyl radical scavengers tBA and DMSO. Based on these findings, a reaction scheme is proposed that suggests the formation of superoxide after peroxidation of FP-12, which is subsequently converted to hydroxyl radicals by the iron-catalysed Haber-Weiss reaction.",Is FP-12 mutagenic for TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
649,"That enzyme fractions derived from animals chronically fed alcohol can alter the metabolism of carcinogenic xenobiotic compounds has been documented. To further understand this relationship the mutagenicity of 3 aromatic amines was determined in the Ames test, employing activation systems derived from rats maintained on an alcohol-containing liquid diet, an isocaloric control liquid diet or Aroclor 1254-pretreated animals fed standard laboratory chow. Depending upon protein and substrate concentrations, S9 from ethanol-fed rats was 30-50% less efficient than S9 from pair-fed rats in activating arylamines (2-aminofluorene, 2-aminoanthracene and 2-acetylaminofluorene) to mutagens in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100. Cytosolic fractions from ethanol-fed animals always resulted in greater arylamine activation than that of controls whereas the opposite was true of the microsomal compartment in which the ethanol-treated group was consistently less active than the controls. The cytosolic N-acetyltransferase activities with respect to 2 different substrates, isoniazid and 2-aminofluorene, were unaffected by ethanol consumption, indicating that this activity probably does not account for the different activation profiles exhibited by the ethanol and pair-fed cytosolic systems. Both the cytosolic and microsomal compartments are required for maximal expression of the mutagenicity of each arylamine however, each compartment can activate arylamines independently of the other. Reconstituting cytosol with microsomes from ethanol- and pair-fed rats, but not Aroclor-pretreated rats, resulted in a synergistic activation of the aromatic amines and displayed an effect similar to that of S9. Compared to Aroclor pretreatment and pair-fed controls, microsomes from ethanol-fed rats displayed the least capacity for activating any of the arylamines to mutagens. Microsomes from Aroclor-pretreated rats accounted for at least 80% of the S9-mediated activation of each of the arylamines to mutagenic metabolites which was in marked contrast to the contribution of the microsomal fractions to the S9 activity in the ethanol- (5-20% of S9 activity) and pair-fed systems (22-30% of S9 activity). The data indicate that 2 opposing reactions occur in S9, a cytosolic activity that augments and a microsomal activity that attenuates the mutagenicity of arylamines. Both activities are modified by ethanol consumption and Aroclor pretreatment.",Is arylamines mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
650,"The potent carcinogen N-nitrosodiethanolamine (NDELA) becomes mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 when activated by alcohol dehydrogenase from yeast or horse liver. Metabolic pathways different from alpha-oxidation might therefore be important for the activation of N-nitroso-2-hydroxyalkylamines such as NDELA. In an in-vitro test system (Namalva cells), neither NDELA nor N-nitrosoethyl-2-hydroxyethylamine was genotoxic, whereas the corresponding metabolites from alcohol dehydrogenase-mediated oxidation, N-nitroso-2-hydroxymorpholine and N-nitrosoethylethanalamine, induced single-strand breaks even at low doses. An immuno-slot-blot assay was used to study the formation of O6-2-hydroxyethyldeoxyguanosine in rat liver after oral administration of different N-nitroso-2-hydroxyalkylamines. When given at equimolar doses (0.375 mmol/kg), DNA hydroxyethylation was considerably lower (6.7 mumol/mol deoxyguanosine) with NDELA than with N-nitrosoethyl-2-hydroxyethylamine (48.7 mumol/mol deoxyguanosine) or N-nitrosomethyl-2-hydroxyethylamine (72.1 mumol/mol deoxyguanosine). N-Nitroso-2-hydroxymorpholine did not form detectable levels of O6-2-hydroxyethyldeoxyguanosine.",Is NDELA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
651,"Fly ash as a product of coal combustion is known to contain various mutagenic substances, but genotoxic properties, especially of the particular (larger-size) fly ash fraction which is electrostatically precipitated (ESP) in the energy plant, have hardly been investigated. While smaller-size fly ash particles escape through the stack during powder coal combustion, the ESP fraction is collected and used for the manufacturing, for instance according to the Lytag process, of secondary products which can serve several construction purposes. Since fly ash as well as fly ash products are generally introduced into the human environment, a study of possible genotoxic effects to human DNA is indicated. Mutagenic properties of ESP fly ash, as well as of the Lytag product, were investigated by means of the Salmonella microsome assay. The capacity to cause human chromosome damage of both ESP fly ash and Lytag dust was studied in vitro by application of the sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) test using human lymphocytes. Furthermore, effects of ESP fly ash/Lytag dust on the incidence of SCE in peripheral lymphocytes in vivo were measured in an occupationally exposed, male population, using individually matched employees from a flour-processing industry as the control population. It is demonstrated that ultrasonically treated DMSO extracts of ESP fly ash are slightly mutagenic to Salmonella tester strains TA97 and TA102. Lytag dust is effective in inducing reversions in all tester strains. Furthermore, it appeared that both compounds significantly increase the SCE frequency of human lymphocytes after incubation in vitro in comparison to non-exposed cells. Also, peripheral lymphocytes of the occupationally exposed population show a considerably higher incidence of SCE than the control population. Major disturbing factors in assessing the effects of occupational exposure to fly ash/Lytag dust on lymphocyte SCE frequency appeared to be smoking behavior and alcohol consumption. It is concluded that exposure to fly ash from powder coal combustion implies a moderate genotoxic risk to man.",Is ESP fly ash mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True
652,"Because both oxidative and reductive metabolism of the hepatocarcinogen 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) can occur in vivo, we have examined the mutagenicity of compounds which can be formed from 2,4-DNT in an attempt to establish which metabolic pathways contribute to the formation of genotoxic products. A quantitative reversion assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was used to evaluate the mutagenicity of these compounds. 2,4-Dinitrobenzyl alcohol, 2-amino-4-nitrotoluene and 2-nitroso-4-nitrotoluene were found to be more mutagenic to S. typhimurium than is 2,4-DNT and did not require metabolic activation by post-mitochondrial supernatants of Aroclor-induced rat liver homogenates (S9) for their effect. 2-Amino-4-nitrobenzoic acid was also mutagenic to S. typhimurium TA98 in the absence of S9, but its mutagenicity was enhanced when S9 was included in the incubation mixture. 2,4-Diaminotoluene required S9 for demonstration of mutagenicity and was approximately as effective, on a molar basis, as 2,4-DNT in inducing reversion to histidine prototrophy. These results suggest that both oxidative and reductive metabolism may be involved in production of mutagenic metabolites of 2,4-DNT.",Is 2-Amino-4-nitrobenzoic acid mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
653,"Phenylephrine hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine recommended for use as a nasal decongestant and as a mydriatic in ophthalmic applications. In 1977, total U.S. human exposure was estimated at 1.9 x 107 g per year. Phenylephrine hydrochloride was nominated for toxicology and carcinogenesis studies because of a lack of previous long-term studies and because two other sympathomimetic agents (soterenol hydrochloride and mesuprine hydrochloride) produced mesovarial leiomyomas in Sprague-Dawley rats. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of USP-grade phenylephrine hydrochloride were conducted by administering diets containing the chemical (99% pure) to F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex in studies of 14 days, 12 weeks, and 2 years. In the 14-day studies, no toxic effects were seen in rats or mice fed diets containing up to 2,000 ppm phenylephrine hydrochloride. Doses were increased in the 12-week studies, and deaths of male rats and male mice were observed in groups fed diets containing 10,000 or 20,000 ppm; 1/10 male rats in the 5,000-ppm group died. Other than inflammatory eye lesions (considered secondary to the pharmacologic drying action of the chemical), no specific organ toxicity was noted. Body weights decreased as concentrations of phenylephrine hydrochloride in the diet were increased, and feed consumption was lower in dosed rats. Doses of 0, 620, and 1,250 ppm for rats and 0, 1,250, and 2,500 ppm for mice were selected for the 2-year studies because of the decreased body weight gains in animals given higher doses in the 12-week studies. In the 2-year studies, the approximate amount of phenylephrine hydrochloride consumed per day was 24 mg/kg for low dose rats, 50 mg/kg for high dose rats, 133 mg/kg for low dose mice, and 270 mg/kg for high dose mice. Body weight differences in rats appeared to be dose related, and dosed animals were 3%-15% lighter than controls. Body weights of dosed mice averaged 3%-14% lower than those of controls throughout the 2-year studies. Survival of high dose male rats was greater than that of the controls (control, 30/50; low dose, 33/50; high dose, 42/50); differences in survival were not significant for female rats (42/50; 34/50; 36/50), male mice (35/50; 38/50; 43/50), or female mice (37/50; 34/50; 34/50). Few nonneoplastic lesions were related to phenylephrine hydrochloride dosing in rats or mice. Chronic focal inflammation of the liver was observed at increased incidences in dosed rats (male: 2/50; 13/50; 17/50; female:17/50; 28/50; 35/50). Inflammation of the prostate was seen more frequently in dosed than in control males (10/50; 24/50; 24/50). The incidence of focal cellular change in the liver was increased slightly in high dose male mice (0/50; 2/50; 7/50). In male rats, mononuclear cell leukemia (24/50; 9/50; 5/50) and pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland (14/49; 11/50; 2/50) occurred with negative trends, and the incidences in the high dose group were lower than those in the controls. No increases in neoplasia were seen in dosed male or female rats or mice. Phenylephrine hydrochloride was not mutagenic in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA98) with or without Aroclor 1254-induced liver S9 from male Sprague-Dawley rats or male Syrian hamsters. The results of mutagenicity studies of phenylephrine hydrochloride were equivocal in the mouse lymphoma L5178Y/TK+/- assay in the absence of S9; it was not tested in the presence of S9. Phenylephrine hydrochloride induced sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) but not chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The increase in SCEs was seen only in the absence of metabolic activation with S9. An audit of the experimental data was conducted for the 2-year studies of phenylephrine hydrochloride. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Under the conditions of these 2-year studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity of phenylephrine hydrochloride for male B6C3F1 mice given 1,250 or 2,500 ppm in feed. Survival of high dose male rats was greater than of high dose male rats was greater than that of controls, and the incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia and pheochromocytomas were lower in dosed than in control male rats. Inflammation was observed more frequently in the liver and prostate gland of dosed male rats than in controls.

654,"Studies were performed to determine the direct mutagenicity of the acetates and some bromides and sulfates of hydroxymethyl polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. Benzylic acetates, bromides and sulfates were synthesized and characterized. The compounds tested were benzyl alcohol, 5-hydroxymethylchrysene, 1-hydroxymethylpyrene, 6-hydroxymethylbenzo[a]pyrene, 6-(2-hydroxyethyl)benzo[a]pyrene, 6-hydroxymethylanthanthrene, 9-hydroxymethylanthracene, 9-hydroxymethyl-10-methylanthracene, 7-hydroxymethylbenz[a]anthracene, 7-(2-hydroxyethyl)benz[a]anthracene, 12-hydroxymethylbenz[a]anthracene, 7-hydroxymethyl-12-methylbenz[a]anthracene, 12-hydroxymethyl-7-methylbenz[a]anthracene, 1-hydroxy-3-methylcholanthrene, 2-hydroxy-3-methylcholanthrene, 3-hydroxy-3, 4-dihydrocyclopental[cd]pyrene and 4-hydroxy-3, 4-dihydrocyclopental[cd]pyrene. The benzylic sulfate esters of 6-hydroxymethylbenzo[a]pyrene and 7-hydroxymethylbenz[a]anthracene were the most mutagenic compounds, whereas the aliphatic sulfate ester of 7-hydroxyethylbenz[a]anthracene did not cause an increase in mutations above background. All meso-anthracenic benzylic acetate esters were mutagenic in both strains with various degrees of activity, whereas the corresponding non-benzylic esters were inactive, as expected. Of the non-meso-benzylic acetate esters, only the 3-acetoxy-3, 4-dihydrocyclopenta[cd]pyrene was mutagenic. In the benzylic bromide series, only the eight mesoanthracenic were mutagenic, whereas benzyl bromide and 5-bromomethylchrysene were inactive. The aliphatic bromides, 6-(2-bromoethyl)benzo[a]pyrene and 7-(2-bromoethyl)benz[a]anthracene did not display significant activity. The potencies of the acetate esters more accurately reflect the mutagenicity because the rate of solvolysis did not compete with the reactivity of the esters with bacterial DNA. In the case of benzylic sulfates and bromides, the rate of solvolysis was very rapid and could have diminished the level of mutagenicity, depending on the assay conditions. These results demonstrate that meso-anthracenic benzylic acetates, sulfates and bromides are mutagenic, whereas benzylic acetate esters attached to other carbon atoms are inactive.",Is 7-hydroxymethylbenz[a]anthracene mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
655,"Allyl isothiocyanate, a naturally occurring compound, component of oil of mustard and human food plants such as cabbage, cauliflower and horseradish, has up to now been regarded as nonmutagenic in bacterial mutagenicity testing systems. Recently, however, it was found to cause transitional-cell papillomas in the urinary bladder of male F344 rats. Contrary to earlier reports, in this study allyl isothiocyanate showed clear mutagenicity for Salmonella typhimurium TA100 in the preincubation assay after longer, non-standard preincubation times (greater than 20 min). The mutagenicity is expressed only in the presence of a rat-liver homogenate metabolising system, i.e. it is indirect. However, high concentrations of rat-liver homogenate suppress the mutagenicity of allyl isothiocyanate. SKF525, inhibitor of microsomal oxygenase, reduces the mutagenic potential which on the other hand is increased in the presence of 1,1,1-trichloropropene-2-oxide, inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase. This indicates the occurrence of an epoxide intermediate in allyl isothiocyanate metabolism. Another metabolic pathway, namely hydrolysis to allyl alcohol and oxidation to acrolein, a known mutagen, also seems possible as cyanamide, inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase, can slightly increase the mutagenic potential. The reason(s) for allyl isothiocyanate's requirement for long preincubation times to express mutagenicity still requires elucidation, and the question arises: is allyl isothiocyanate a single, exceptional case or not?",Is Allyl isothiocyanate mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
656,"Valepotriates are epoxide-bearing triesters of the monoterpene alcohol 4,7-dimethylcyclopenta-(c)-pyrane isolated from the roots of several Valerianacae species. They are regarded as the main tranquilizing constituents of these drugs. Although the valepotriates valtrate/isovaltrate (VAL) and dihydrovaltrate (DH-VAL) showed a strong alkylating activity against the nucleophilic agent 4-(p-nitrobenzyl)-pyridine (NBP), they were not clearly mutagenic for the strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 of Salmonella typhimurium or for the strains WP2 and WP2 uvrA- of Escherichia coli in the absence of a metabolic activation system (S9-mix). However, the valepotriates were mutagenic for TA100, WP2 and WP2 uvrA- at concentrations up to about 1.0 mumole/plate when S9-mix was added to the test system. With more than 1 mumole/plate the valepotriates were toxic in the presence of a metabolic activation system for all strains tested. The mutagenicity of the valepotriates was inversely related to the protein content of the S9-mix used. The mutagenicity and toxicity of the valepotriates could be inhibited when the S9-mix was preincubated with the esterase inhibitor paraoxon (1 mM) for 5 min before the test compounds and bacteria were added. Therefore, bioactivation of the valepotriates by an enzymatic hydrolysis of their ester groups is considered. This could be proven by activating the valepotriates with purified esterase.",Is Valepotriates mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
657,"The mutagenicity of 24 benzyl derivatives, containing a variety of substituents and leaving groups, were assayed in strain TA100 using the Ames plate-incorporation assay. p-Nitrobenzyl chloride (12 000 revertants/mumole), p-nitrobenzyl tosylate (6100 revertants/mumole), and p-acetoxybenzyl chloride (100 revertants/mumole) were mutagenic; none of the remaining 21 compounds were mutagenic. p-Nitrobenzyl chloride was also found to be mutagenic in strain TA98 (700 revertants/mumole), but not in strain TA98NR (a strain deficient in nitro reductase activity). p-Acetoxybenzyl chloride was nonenzymatically hydrolyzed to p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol and p-acetoxybenzyl alcohol. These findings suggest that nitrobenzyl derivatives were mutagenic due to nitro reductive metabolism and that p-acetoxybenzyl chloride was mutagenic due to the intermediate formation of p-hydroxybenzyl chloride during the hydrolysis of p-acetoxybenzyl chloride.",Is p-Nitrobenzyl chloride mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
658,"The Ames test was performed on Salmonella typhimurium, strain TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, to evaluate the mutagenic potential of a tar as well as its vapors and aerosols emitted at 250, 350 and 550 degrees C. Two chemical procedures were used: extractions of aromatics for DMSO; elimination of acids, alcohols and phenols. Weak mutagenic activity was demonstrated at each temperature. Then, using only Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100, a study was made on the effects of the mutagenic compounds, benzo[a]pyrene, 2-aminoanthracene, nitrofluorene, methyl methanesulfonate and on the vapors and aerosols emitted at 350 degrees C by road-coating tar.

659,"The activation of dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) to a bacterial mutagen in liver subcellular fraction and in intrasanguinous host-mediated assays was studied, in particular the effect of pretreatment of the animals with ethanol or acetone. Salmonella typhimurium TA 92 was much more sensitive to DMN mutagenicity than TA 100 and TA 1535 or Escherichia coli WP2uvrA and was used for the main part of the study. Noteworthy, in part already known, features of the in vitro activation are the relatively low pH optimum (pH 6-6.4), the non-linear dose-mutagenic response-relationship and the relatively high doses of DMN required for activation with control preparations. Pretreatment of mice with ethanol or acetone greatly reduced the minimal mutagenically effective concentration of DMN in the in vitro assay. Pretreatment with Aroclor 1254, an inducer frequently used in mutagenicity research, showed little effect when used alone, but reduced the potentiation by acetone. The results of the host-mediated assays substantially differed from those of the in vitro activation assays (a) in the relatively low dose of DMN required for mutagenicity to occur and (b) in the lack of potentiation by acetone-or ethanol-pretreatment. Acetone even led to a marginal decrease in mutagenicity. As a possible explantation for this apparent discrepancy were assume that with the in vitro system the activity of the dilute metabolizing system is limiting for the activation of DMN and induction therefore will increase the mutagenicity, whereas in vivo DMN is quantitatively metabolized in both induced and non-induced animals. The results show that caution has to be taken in the interpretation from in vitro results to the in vivo situation. In particular our in vivo experiments do not support the hypothesis that the induction by ethanol of an activating system with a low Km (which would strongly activate traces of DMN ingested with many foods) is one of the reasons for the increased risk of liver tumors in alcoholics.",Is ethanol mutagenic for WP2uvrA strain?,False
660,"Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading infectious causes of death due to single infectious agent after HIV/AIDS. Rifampicin (RIF), Isoniazid (INH), Ethambutol (EMB), Pyrazinamide (PZA) and/or their combinations are extensively prescribed to treat TB. Despite several therapeutic implications, these drugs also produce several toxic effects at cellular level. MTT assay and Ames test were adopted in this study for the determination of cytotoxic and mutagenic potential of these anti-TB drugs. Among all tested drugs, cytotoxic potential of RIF was strongest with highly significant decline (p<0.001) in cell numbers at the concentration of 250μg/ml with LC50 at 325μg/ml, while significant decline (p<0.01) in cell count was observed in INH treated group at the concentration 500μg/ml with LC50 at 1000μg/ml. Moreover, combination RIPE demonstrated significant reduction (p<0.01) in cell number at the concentration of 25-500-500-500μg/ml with LC50 at 60-1200-1200-1200μg/ml. It is apparent from the data that almost all drugs represented identical mutagenic pattern i.e., more significant results were achieved in TA100 with metabolic activation (+S9). RIF proved to be highly mutagenic of all tested drugs with significant mutagenicity (p<0.01) at 0.0525μg/plate against TA98 strain with S9. The combination RIPE exhibited highly significant mutagenic activity (p<0.01) at concentration 0.125-3-3-3μg/plate without S9, while addition of S9 resulted in similar activity at lower doses, i.e., 0.0525-1-1-1μg/plate. It was concluded from the data that all anti-TB drugs possess significant cytotoxic and mutagenic potential, especially in combination, making TB patient more vulnerable to cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of anti-TB drugs, which could produce further health complications in TB patients.

Hydrazine, an impurity of the INH sample, was also weakly mutagenic in strains TA100 and TA1535, but not in the extent that could account for the mutagenicity of the INH sample.

Moreover, combination RIPE demonstrated significant reduction (p<0.01) in cell number at the concentration of 25-500-500-500μg/ml with LC50 at 60-1200-1200-1200μg/ml. It is apparent from the data that almost all drugs represented identical mutagenic pattern i.e., more significant results were achieved in TA100 with metabolic activation (+S9). RIF proved to be highly mutagenic of all tested drugs with significant mutagenicity (p<0.01) at 0.0525μg/plate against TA98 strain with S9. The combination RIPE exhibited highly significant mutagenic activity (p<0.01) at concentration 0.125-3-3-3μg/plate without S9, while addition of S9 resulted in similar activity at lower doses, i.e., 0.0525-1-1-1μg/plate. It was concluded from the data that all anti-TB drugs possess significant cytotoxic and mutagenic potential, especially in combination, making TB patient more vulnerable to cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of anti-TB drugs, which could produce further health complications in TB patients.

663,"The mutagenic activity of isoniazid, N-acetyl-isoniazid and hydrazine dihydrochloride was investigated in S. typhimurium. Isoniazid was found to possess a weak mutagenic activity only in repair-deficient strains TA1535 and TA100 as well as in the plasmid-containing strain TA92 (10-30 mg/plate) in the Ames test without metabolic activation. Addition of microsomal enzymes by S9 mix decreased this direct mutagenic activity. In contrast, preincubation of isoniazid with crude liver homogenate from mice, rats or Syrian golden hamsters for 4 h prior to plating with bacteria liberated a mutagenic compound which is equally active in both repair-deficient and repair wild-type strains (0.5-5 mg/plate). This activation pathway is independent of NADPH, is heat-sensitive and is operative only in a total liver homogenate in suspension. The highest capacity for mutagenic activation was achieved with liver homogenate from hamsters, followed by that from mice and rats. Furthermore, this mutagenic activation is paralleled by formation of hydrazine, as demonstrated in colorimetric measurements with p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde. N-Acetyl-isoniazid is without mutagenic activity under similar conditions, and liberation of hydrazine was never detected. This means that, besides having a weak direct genetic activity, isoniazid is a promutagen, and formation of hydrazine is the first step in metabolic activation. It is concluded that the genotoxic properties of isoniazid in mammals are primarily determined by the pharmacokinetic behavior of the ultimate reactive metabolite. This result must be taken into consideration in risk assessment performed for mutagenic and carcinogenic properties of isoniazid in man.",Is Isoniazid mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
664,"Mutagenic and clastogenic effects of some DNA damaging agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) have been demonstrated to exhibit a nonlinear or even ""thresholded"" dose-response in vitro and in vivo. DNA repair seems to be mainly responsible for these thresholds. To this end, we assessed several mutagenic alkylators in the Ames test with four different strains of Salmonella typhimurium: the alkyl transferases proficient strain TA1535 (Ogt+/Ada+), as well as the alkyl transferases deficient strains YG7100 (Ogt+/Ada-), YG7104 (Ogt-/Ada+) and YG7108 (Ogt-/Ada-). The known genotoxins EMS, MMS, temozolomide (TMZ), ethylnitrosourea (ENU) and methylnitrosourea (MNU) were tested in as many as 22 concentration levels. Dose-response curves were statistically fitted by the PROAST benchmark dose model and the Lutz-Lutz ""hockeystick"" model. These dose-response curves suggest efficient DNA-repair for lesions inflicted by all agents in strain TA1535. In the absence of Ogt, Ada is predominantly repairing methylations but not ethylations. It is concluded that the capacity of alkyl-transferases to successfully repair DNA lesions up to certain dose levels contributes to genotoxicity thresholds.",Is MMS mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
665,"The ajowain (Carum copticum (L.)) is a popular spice and traditionally used in Indian system of medicine. Considering the importance of natural products in modern phytomedicine, the antioxidant and antimutagenic activities of C. copticum fruits extract and its fractions were evaluated. The methanol fraction showed highest antioxidant activity by phosphomolybdenum (2087.7 micromol) and DPPH assay (90.2%) followed by other fractions comparable to ascorbic acid and BHT. Based on antioxidant activity, methanol fraction was evaluated for antimutagenic potential against direct acting mutagens sodium azide (NaN(3)) and methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) and indirect acting mutagens 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) and benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), using Salmonella typhimurium (TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA102) tester strains. The methanolic fraction showed no sign of mutagenicity at tested concentrations (25-100 microg/plate). Antimutagenic activity was recorded with inhibition of mutagenicity ranging from 10.8% to 83.1% in a concentration dependent manner. The phytochemical analysis by IR, HPLC, GC-MS, and total phenolic assay revealed a high content of phenolic terpenoids. Further, characterization of active principle is needed to understand the mechanism of action and therapeutic efficacy in vivo.",Is ajowain mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
666,"The mutagenic and antimutagenic effects of linalool, linalyl acetate and beta-caryophyllene were evaluated by the bacterial reverse mutation assay on Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100, and on Escherichia coli WP2uvrA strains. Neither linalool nor beta-caryophyllene showed mutagenicity, but linalyl acetate induced a statistically significant increase in the number of revertant colonies in WP2uvrA, both with and without S9 mixture. Linalool was devoid of antimutagenic activity against 2-nitrofluorene (2NF), sodium azide (SA), methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) and 2-aminoanthracene (2AA). In contrast, beta-caryophyllene showed a strong antimutagenic activity against 2NF: at the maximum concentration tested (6.40mg/plate) the number of 2NF-induced revertant colonies was reduced by 83.9%. beta-Caryophyllene also showed to counteract the mutagenicity of SA (in TA 100), MMS and 2AA (in WP2uvrA): the effect was weak against SA (inhibition lower than 25%) and moderate against MMS and 2AA (up to 30.5%). The antimutagenic activity of beta-caryophyllene observed here suggests further studies to evaluate its possible chemopreventive properties.",Is linalool mutagenic for WP2uvrA strain?,False
667,"Antimutagenic, anticlastogenic, and bioprotective effect of polysaccharide glucomannan (GM) isolated from Candida utilis was evaluated in four model test systems. The antimutagenic effect of GM against 9-aminoacridine (9-AA)- and sodium azide (NaN3)-induced mutagenicity was revealed in the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97 and TA100, respectively. GM showed anticlastogenic effect against N-nitroso-N'-methylurea (NMU) induced chromosome aberrations in the Vicia sativa assay. The bioprotective effect of GM co-treated with methyl-methane-sulphonate (MMS) was also established in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii repair deficient strains uvs10 and uvs14. The statistically significant antimutagenic potential of GM was not proved against 4-nitro-quinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO)-induced mutagenicity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7 assay. It may be due to bioprotectivity of alpha-mannan and beta-glucan, which are integral part of S. cerevisiae cell walls. Due to the good water solubility, low molecular weight (30 kDa), antimutagenic/anticlastogenic, and bioprotective activity against chemical compounds differing in mode of action, GM appears to be a promising natural protective (antimutagenic) agent.",Is glucomannan mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
668,"The antimutagenic properties of South African herbal teas were investigated using the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay. Aqueous extracts of fermented and unfermented rooibos tea (Aspalathus linearis) and honeybush tea (Cyclopia intermedia) both possess antimutagenic activity against 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) and aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1))-induced mutagenesis using tester strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence of metabolic activation. A far less inhibitory effect was noticed against the direct acting mutagens, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), cumolhydroperoxide (CHP), and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) using TA102, a strain designed to detect oxidative mutagens and carcinogens. Depending on the mutagen used, the unfermented tea exhibited the highest protective effect. A similar response regarding the protection against mutagenesis was obtained when utilising different variations of the double layer Salmonella assay. The double layer technique proved to be more effective to detect the protective effect of the different tea preparations against the direct acting mutagens. With respect to indirect mutagens, the highest protection was noticed when the carcinogen was metabolically activated in the presence of the tea extract as compared with when the tea extract was incubated in a separate layer with the bacteria. The current data suggest that two mechanisms seem to be involved in the antimutagenicity of the tea extracts towards carcinogens that require metabolic activation: (i) the tea components may interfere with cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of these mutagens and (ii) the direct interaction between the tea constituents, presumably the polyphenolic compounds, with the promutagens and/or the active mutagenic metabolites. However, the mild and/or lack of protection and in some cases even enhancement of mutagenesis induced by direct acting or oxidative mutagens, provide new perspectives regarding the role of the polyphenolic compounds known to exhibit antioxidant properties, in the protection against mutagenesis in the Salmonella assay. The present study provides the first evidence on the antimutagenic activity of honeybush tea and further evidence on the antimutagenicity of rooibos tea.",Is Aspalathus linearis mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
669,"Reconstituted non-fat dry milk powder, fermented by a mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus CH3 and Lactobacillus bulgaricus 191R to produce yogurt, was freeze-dried and extracted in acetone. After evaporation of the acetone, the extract was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and tested for antimutagenicity. In the Ames test, significant dose-dependent activity was observed against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), 4-nitro-quinoline-N-oxide (4NQO), 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB), 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benz[a]anthracene (DMBA), and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole acetate (Trp-P-2). Weak activity was observed against 1,2,7,8-diepoxyoctane (DEO), and no activity was observed against methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), or aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). In a related assay (Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7), significant antimutagenic activity was detected against MNNG and 4NQO. Activity against the experimental colon carcinogens MNNG and DMAB was examined further, as assayed in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA100). Compounds responsible for both activities were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in DMSO. Adjustment of yogurt pH to 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the amount of anti-MNNG activity recovered. In contrast, extractability of anti-DMAB activity was significantly greater at acidic pH. Conjugated linoleic acid, a known dairy anticarcinogen, failed to inhibit mutagenesis caused by either mutagen, suggesting that other yogurt-derived compound(s) are responsible. Unfermented milk was treated with lactic acid, yogurt bacteria without subsequent growth, or both, to determine if formation of antimutagenic activity required bacterial growth. Extracts of the milk treatments exhibited the same weak antimutagenicity observed in unfermented milk, approximately 2.5-fold less than in the yogurt extracts, suggesting that antimutagenic activity is associated with bacterial growth.",Is non-fat dry milk mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
670,"Destruction procedures for dimethylsulfate (DMS), diethylsulfate (DES), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) have been investigated using treatment by 1 N NaOH, 1 N NH4OH, 1 M Na2CO3, and 1 M Na2S2O3. During the kinetic study of the destruction process, the determination of remaining concentrations of the alkylating agents was performed by the derivatization of p-nitrophenoxide to p-nitroanisole and p-nitrophenetole, which were separated by high performance liquid chromatography. The mutagenic activity of the destruction products was evaluated by the Ames test using Salmonella tester strains TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA102. The kinetics of destruction in every case followed a time-dependent exponential relationship. Solutions of 1 M Na2S2O3 showed the highest capacity for destruction of the four alkylating agents, half-lives of DMS, DES, MMS, and EMS being 0.14 min, 1.26 min, 0.60 min, and 5.26 min, respectively. No mutagenic activity was detected following complete destruction in 1 M Na2S2O3.",Is dimethylsulfate mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
671,"The influence of the O(6)-alkylation in Salmonella typhimurium cells by monofunctional methanesulphonates on their mutagenicity in strains TA1535 and TA100 was examined using a specially modified method that allows DNA-binding studies in bacteria. All the tested monofunctional compounds, methylmethanesulphonate (MMS; very strong Sn2 reactivity), ethylmethanesulphonate (EMS; moderate Sn1 and Sn2 reactivity) and isopropylmethanesulphonate (iPMS; strong Sn1 reactivity) formed significant amounts of O(6)-Palkylguanine. A comparison between the results in a pure in vitro system and the situation in the bacterial cells revealed significant differences. Despite having different alkylating reactivities, MMS and iPMS produced similar amounts of O(6)-adducts in bacterial DNA, probably owing to the much lower hydrolysis rate of MMS when compared with that of iPMS. The O(6):N7 ratio was, however, ten-fold higher in the case of iPMS, which reflects its clearly higher Sn1 reactivity. Owing to the formation of O(6)-adducts, all three test compounds induced back mutations in strain TA1535, which is not capable of performing error-prone repair. Whereas MMS showed a much higher mutagenic activity in strain TA100, because of the large amount of N-alkylation, iPMS induced practically identical mutagenicity in both strains, which indicates that the pkM101 plasmid is not significantly involved in iPMS mutagenicity. Evidently only strong Sn2-type monofunctional alkylating compounds induce back mutation in strain TA100 by the pkM101-mediated error-prone mechanism. This underlines the importance of the O(6)-alkylation as promutagenic lesion in strains containing the His G46 mutation. Surprisingly, EMS showed a higher mutagenicity in strain TA1535 than in TA100.",Is MMS mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
672,"No mutagenicity or an uncertain mutagenic response has been reported in the literature for methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) in S. typhimurium strain TA1535 when using the plate assay. In our studies we found a reproducible mutagenic activity of 62 revertants/mumole and plate for MMS in strain TA1535 when using the preincubation assay. A dose-dependent increase in revertants was, however, observed only at fairly high doses (exceeding 4 mumole). Two different slopes were observed in the dose-response curve when testing MMS with strain TA100. Slope A is dependent on the error-prone response, possible only in strain TA100 due to the pKm101 plasmid (R factor) but not possible in strain TA1535 due to its umuDC deficiency. Slope B observed at higher doses (as in strain TA1535) could be explained through a GC----AT transition initiated by the O6-methylation of guanine. Our findings demonstrate that MMS induces back mutation in S. typhimurium strains carrying the hisG46 missense mutation due to the formation of O6-methylguanine. In the case of strain TA100 the pKm101 plasmid-mediated error-prone mechanism is, however, the predominant process in MMS mutagenesis which leads to a higher mutagenic response at much lower doses than the GT----AT transition in strain TA1535.",Is MMS mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
673,"The S9 phenobarbital-induced preparations from Albino rats and 6 strains of inbred and outbred Pzh: SFISS mice were tested by an Ames test for their ability to metabolize the two promutagens 2-aminofluorene (2AF) and cyclophosphamide (CP), and to influence the mutagenic activity of the two directly acting mutagens methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). 2AF showed a mutagenic activity after incubation with all kinds of microsomal preparations. S9 from B10. mice (Ah+Ah+) was twice as active as that from D2.BN mice (Ah- Ah-). CP was mutagenic exclusively in the presence of S9 from Pzh: SFISS or B10. mice and from rats. Neither fraction deactivated significantly the mutagenicity of MMS.

674,"Many metals have been shown to alter the function of a wide range of enzyme systems, including those involved in DNA repair and replication. To assess the impact in vivo of such metal actions a ""Microtitre"" fluctuation assay was used to examine the ability of Ni(II) to act as a comutagen with simple alkylating agents. In E. coli, Ni(II) chloride potentiated the mutagenicity of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) in polymerase-proficient strains (WP2+ and WP2-), but not in polA- strains (WP6 and WP67) or in lexA- (CM561) or recA- (CM571) strains. The absence of UV excision repair (WP2- and WP67) had little, if any, effect. An extended lag phase was seen at 2-4 h in the polA- strains following treatment with Ni(II) chloride and MMS, but normal growth resumed thereafter. Results suggested that mutations induced by MMS were fixed during log phase growth and that more than 2 h of exposure were necessary for potentiation by Ni(II) to be observed. Thus, the extended lag phase probably cannot explain the lack of potentiation. RecA-dependence of the comutagenic effect was corroborated with S. typhimurium TA1535 and TA100. Only in the pKM101 containing strain, TA100, was potentiation of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and MMS by Ni(II) chloride evident. The mucAB genes carried on pKM101 increase the sensitivity of TA100 to a variety of mutagens, providing there is a functional recA gene product. Taken together, the data suggest that Ni(II) acts indirectly, as a comutagen, in bacterial systems, possibly affecting processes involving recA- and/or polA-dependent function(s).",Is MMS mutagenic for pKM101 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
675,"Several mutants with decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were isolated from the sensitive mutagen tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA100 after treatment with u.v. and selection for resistance to N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG) and its methyl analogue MNNG. Estimation of the GSH concentration and GSH S-transferase activity in extracts of these strains and of TA100 indicates that the GSH- derivatives contain 10-30% of the GSH level found in TA100, and that they exhibit normal GSH S-transferase activity. The mutagenic activities of 7 chemicals, namely, MNNG, ENNG, 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE), 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), styrene-7,8-oxide (STOX), N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) were compared in TA100 and in one representative GSH- strain, denominated NG-57. MNNG, ENNG, DBE and CDNB are potent to extremely potent mutagens in TA100, but induce very low levels of His+ mutants in NG-57. Pretreatment of NG-57 with 1 mM GSH (partially) restores the mutant yields to the levels usually found in TA100. The mutagenic activities of STOX, ENU and MMS are similar in both strains. These results support some previous findings, namely that ENNG, MNNG and DBE, but not ENU are activated to mutagens inside the test bacteria, and also suggest that CDNB is activated by bacterial GSH. The latter finding is in contrast with the current view that CDNB is detoxified by GSH, as is also presently evidenced by a strong reduction of the compound's mutagenicity in the presence of extracts of rat liver, which contains GSH and GSH S-transferase activity. The results with STOX indicate that GSH plays in bacteria a much less important role in the detoxification of xenobiotics than in mammalian tissue, presumably due to a much lower GSH S-transferase activity in the first organism.",Is MMS mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
676,"Mutagenicities of AF-2, MNNG, 4NQO, aflatoxin B1, benzo [a] pyrene and Trp-P-1, with or without metabolic activation, were inactivated by treatment with human saliva to a great extent in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium test strains TA98 and TA100. Mutagenic activities of quercetin, pyrolysates of beef, salmon and sodium glutamate, and condensate of cigarette smoke were also decreased to some extent by saliva treatment, but no significant effect was found on the activity of MMS and pyrolysate of polypeptone. These effects showed individual variations. The inhibition of AF-2 mutagenicity by saliva varied with temperature in TA100 but not in TA98 cultures. Boiled saliva inactivated AF-2 mutagenicity in TA98 to some extent but not in TA100 cultures. Inactivation of AF-2 mutagenicity by saliva treatment was completed within 30 sec. Complex mechanisms may be involved in the inactivation of mutagenicity of carcinogens by saliva, including biochemical reactions with enzymes, vitamins, etc. and/or adsorption with high molecular weight substances in saliva such as proteins, bacterial cells, mucous materials, etc.",Is MMS mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
677,"Four different model nucleophiles, 4-(p-nitrobenzyl)pyridine (NBP), N-methylmercaptoimidazole (MMI), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and H2O were tested with 22 methanesulphonates of widely varying structures for their suitability to predict mutagenic activities in S. typhimurium TA100. The soft nucleophiles NBP (N-alkylation) and MMI (S-alkylation) revealed as highly sensitive for SN2 reactivities whereas TFA (solvolysis at the O-atom) and H2O (hydrolysis) were very sensitive for SN1 reactivities. No correlation between the NBP or the MMI test and the Ames test was found. Quite good correlations could be demonstrated for the TFA test and the hydrolysis rates: with rising activities in the TFA solvolysis the mutagenic potencies were increasing up to a maximum at i-propyl methanesulphonate. After that due to the fast hydrolysis the mutagenicities were decreasing again despite increasing TFA solvolysis rates. In general the secondary methanesulphonates exerted high SN1 reactivities and distinct mutagenic activities, whereas the primary compounds showed no or very low SN1 reactivities and low mutagenic potentials. The ""activated"" compounds cyclopropylmethyl methanesulphonate, benzyl methanesulphonate and allyl methanesulphonate exerted high SN1 and SN2 reactivities. Methyl methanesulphonate displayed a high mutagenicity in spite of its lack in SN1 reactivity. This is probably due to the induction of the error prone repair (pkM 101 plasmid in TA100). The relation between the alkylating reactivities (SN1 and SN2) and the molecular mechanisms leading to back mutation is discussed.",Is Methyl methanesulphonate mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
678,"We have previously described a very sensitive and efficient bacterial test designed to detect chemical carcinogens as mutagens. Chloroacetaldehyde is mutagenic in this system and is of interest because it is a possible metabolite in mammals of the large volume industrial chemicals 1,2-dichloroethane (ethylene dichloride) (3.5 billion kg/yr, U.S.) and vinyl chloride (2.5 billion kg/yr, U.S.), and of the antineoplastic agent cyclophosphamide. Chloroacetaldehyde reverts a new Salmonella bacterial tester strain (TA100). Chloroacetaldehyde is shown to be hundreds of times more effective in reversion of TA100 than is chloroethanol (ethylene chlorohydrin), a known metabolic precursor of chloroacetaldehyde and a possible metabolite of dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, or than vinyl chloride, which is itself mutagenic for TA100. Chloroethanol is shown to be activated by rat (or human) liver homogenates to a more highly mutagenic form with reversion properties similar to chloroacetaldehyde. Reversion properties of cyclophosphamide after in vitro metabolic activation suggest that chloroacetaldehyde is not the active mutagenic form of this antineoplastic drug.",Is Chloroacetaldehyde mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
679,"The widely used agricultural antifungal agent aureofungin (ARF) was subjected to genotoxicity assessment using the Ames Salmonella assay as well as the in vivo micronucleus test and dominant lethal test in Swiss mice. In the Ames Salmonella spot test, ARF slightly elevated the number of histidine revertants after metabolic activation over a wide dose range (1-1000 micrograms/plate) in TA102 but not in TA97a, TA98 or TA100. In the preincubation plate incorporation assay with TA102, ARF increased the number of revertants in a dose-dependent manner only after metabolic activation. ARF failed to significantly elevate the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (PE) in the bone marrow of Swiss mice. It elevated the frequency of dominant lethal mutations in the 7th and 8th weeks at 30 mg/kg body weight, a concentration much higher than the actual concentration used in the field. We conclude that ARF is non-mutagenic in somatic cells in vivo at doses used in the present study, probably mutagenic in stem-cell spermatogonia and may be classified as an equivocal promutagen, possibly acting as a cross-linker.",Is ARF mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
680,"o-Nitroanisole is used as an intermediate for the preparation of o-anisidine and in the manufacture of azo dyes. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering o-nitroanisole (>99% pure) in the diet to groups of male and female F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice for 14 days, 13 weeks, and 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and mouse lymphoma cells. 14-DAY STUDIES: Groups of five male and five female F344 rats received diets containing 0, 583, 1,166, 2,332, 4,665, or 9,330 ppm o-nitroanisole. Mean body weight gains and final mean body weights of males in the 4,665 and 9,330 ppm groups were lower than those of the controls. Absolute liver weights were significantly increased in males receiving 1,166 ppm or more and in females receiving 583 ppm or more. Groups of five male and five female B6C3F1 mice received diets containing 0, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. Mean body weight gains and final mean body weights of males that received 250 ppm and females that received 4,000 ppm were significantly lower than those of the controls. No other chemical-associated effects were observed. 13-WEEK STUDIES: Groups of 10 male and 10 female F344 rats received diets containing 0, 200, 600, 2,000, 6,000, or 18,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. Final mean body weights and feed consumption by male and female rats receiving 6,000 and 18,000 ppm were lower than those of the controls. Hemoglobin and hematocrit values were significantly lower and methemoglobin levels significantly higher in males in the 6,000 and 18,000 ppm groups than in controls. Absolute liver weights were significantly increased in females that received 200, 600, 2,000, and 6,000 ppm, absolute kidney weights were significantly increased in males that received 600, 2,000, and 6,000 ppm, and absolute spleen weights were significantly increased in males and females that received 6,000 and 18,000 ppm. Groups of 10 male and 10 female B6C3F1 mice received diets containing 0, 60, 200, 600, 2,000, or 6,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. Final mean body weight gains, final mean body weights, and feed consumption by male and female mice receiving 6,000 ppm were lower than those of the controls. Hemoglobin and hematocrit values in males and females that received 2,000 or 6,000 ppm were significantly lower than those in the controls. The absolute and relative liver weights of females in the 600 ppm group and relative liver weights of males and females in the 2,000 and 6,000 ppm groups were significantly greater than those of controls. Lesions associated with exposure to o-nitroanisole were present in the urinary bladder, spleen, kidney, liver, testis, and uterus of rats. Diffuse hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder occurred in all male and female rats that received 6,000 and 18,000 ppm. A transitional cell papilloma occurred in one male and transitional cell carcinomas occurred in two males and three females receiving 18,000 ppm. Congestion of the red pulp and capsular hyperplasia of the spleen and hepatocellular hypertrophy of the liver were present in males and females from the 18,000 ppm groups. Multifocal degeneration and necrosis of the renal tubule epithelium with infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells were present in male rats that received 600, 2,000, and 6,000 ppm. At the 18,000 ppm level, degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium accompanied by loss of spermatogenic cells and decreased numbers of spermatozoa were observed in the testes of male rats, while uterine atrophy was observed in female rats. Hepatocyte hypertrophy of the centrilobular and midzonal regions of liver lobules was present in mice that received 200 ppm and increased in severity at higher exposure levels. 2-YEAR STUDIES: The doses selected for the 2-year study of o-nitroanisole in rats were based on lower mean body weights, reduced feed consumption, and increased severity of regenerative anemia in male and female rats receiving 6,000 and 18,000 ppm during the 13-week study. Groups of 6roups of 60 male and 60 female F344 rats received diets containing 0, 222, 666, or 2,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. Groups of 60 male and 60 female B6C3F1 mice received diets containing 0, 666, 2,000, or 6,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. After 15 months, up to 10 animals from each group were evaluated for chemical-related lesions. Survival, Body Weights, Feed Consumption, and Clinical Findings: Survival of male rats receiving 2,000 ppm was significantly lower than that of the controls due to increased severity of nephropathy. Survival of 222 and 666 ppm male rats and all exposed female rats was similar to that of the controls. Survival of groups of exposed male and female mice was similar to that of the controls. The final mean body weight of male rats receiving 2,000 ppm was lower than that of the controls. Final mean body weights of male and female mice that received 2,000 and 6,000 ppm were lower than those of the controls. Feed consumption by male and female rats was similar to that by the controls. The only clinical finding in male or female mice attributable to chemical administration was discolored urine. Neoplasms and Nonneoplastic Lesions: The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia was significantly increased in male rats that received 666 and 2,000 ppm and in female rats that received 2,000 ppm (males: 0 ppm, 26/50; 222 ppm, 25/50; 666 ppm, 42/50; 2,000 ppm, 34/50; females: 14/50, 11/50, 14/50, 26/50). Nephropathy occurred in all male rats; the severity increased with exposure level. Focal hyperplasia of the renal tubule epithelium was present in three males receiving 222 ppm and two males receiving 2,000 ppm. Renal tubule adenomas occurred in one male from each of the 222, 666, and 2,000 ppm groups, and renal tubule carcinomas occurred in two males from the 2,000 ppm group. Focal hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder was present in one female rat that received 222 ppm and two male rats and six female rats that received 2,000 ppm. A transitional cell papilloma occurred in the urinary bladder of one female rat from the 2,000 ppm group, and a transitional cell carcinoma occurred in another female from the 2,000 ppm group. The incidence of forestomach ulcers increased in male rats that received 2,000 ppm, and the incidence of focal hyperplasia of the forestomach increased with exposure level in male and female rats. In addition, squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach were present in one female receiving 222 ppm, one male receiving 666 ppm, and one male and one female receiving 2,000 ppm, while squamous cell carcinomas were present in one male receiving 666 ppm and one male and one female receiving 2,000 ppm. The incidences of pituitary gland adenomas in male rats and mammary gland fibroadenomas in female rats decreased with exposure level. The incidence of cellular alteration in the liver was significantly increased in exposed groups of male and female mice. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined), and hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma (combined) were significantly increased in male mice receiving 2,000 and 6,000 ppm. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma were significantly increased in female mice that received 2,000 ppm. STOP-EXPOSURE STUDY: Groups of 60 male and 60 female F344 rats received diets containing 0, 6,000, or 18,000 ppm o-nitroanisole for 27 weeks and were then maintained on control feed without further chemical exposure for up to an additional 77 weeks. Up to 10 rats from each group were evaluated for the presence of chemical-related lesions at 3, 6, 9, and 15 months. Survival and Body Weights: Survival of exposed male and female rats was significantly lower than that of the controls as a result of moribund deaths associated with significantly increased incidences of urinary bladder neoplasms, primarily transitional cell carcinomas. All male rats that received 18,000 ppm were dead by week 48 and all females that received 18,000 ppm were dead by week 61. Mean body weights of exposed male and female rats were lower than those of the controls throughout the study. Neoplasms and Nonneoplastic Lesions: Hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder was present in nearly all exposed male and female rats examined at the interim evaluations. A transitional cell carcinoma was first observed at the 3-month interim evaluation in a male rat that received 18,000 ppm. At the 6- and 9-month interim evaluations, transitional cell papillomas or carcinomas were observed in both exposed groups of male rats. Transitional cell carcinomas were observed at the 6-month interim evaluation in females receiving 18,000 ppm and at the 9-month interim evaluation in females receiving 6,000 and 18,000 ppm. Adenomatous polyps of the large intestine were observed in a small number of exposed rats at the 6-, 9-, and 15-month interim evaluations. At the end of the study, the incidence of adenomatous polyps of the large intestine was significantly increased in all exposed groups and carcinomas of the large intestine were present in four males and two females from the 18,000 ppm groups. The incidence of hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium of the kidney pelvis was significantly increased in exposed male and female rats and transitional cell papillomas were present in three males and one female that received 18,000 ppm. Transitional cell carcinomas of the kidney were present in one male receiving 6,000 ppm and six males and one female receiving 18,000 ppm. Transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder were seen in nearly all exposed male and female rats. Of the males and females receiving 6,000 ppm which were without carcinomas, three males and one female had transitional cell papillomas. Generalized centrilobular hypertrophy, focal hepatocellular necrosis, multifocal hepatocellular cytoplasmic vacuolation, and Kupffer cell pigmentation were observed in the livers of male and female rats at the 3- and 6-month interim evaluations; however, only Kupffer cell pigmentation was observed at the end of the study. Congestion of the red pulp of the spleen was observed in nearly all exposed male and female rats at the 3-, 6-, and 9-month interim evaluations but the incidence was only slightly increased in the 18,000 ppm groups at the end of the study. Degeneration and atrophy of the seminiferous tubule epithelium of the testes were observed at the 3- and 6-month interim evaluations in all male rats receiving 18,000 ppm. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: o-Nitroanisole was tested in two laboratories for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 with and without exogenous metabolic activation (S9). Positive responses were observed at both laboratories in TA100 with and without S9 activation. One laboratory found no increase in mutations, while the second laboratory detected a weakly positive response in TA1535 without S9. No mutagenic activity was observed in the other tester strains. o-Nitroanisole was positive in the mouse lymphoma assay for induction of trifluorothymidine resistance in L5178Y cells without S9 activation. In cytogenetic tests with Chinese hamster ovary cells, o-nitroanisole induced a significant increase in chromosomal aberrations at the highest dose tested in the presence of S9 activation; sister chromatid exchanges were induced both with and without S9. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these feed studies there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole in male and female F344 rats that received diets containing 6,000 or 18,000 ppm for 6 months based on overall increased incidences of benign and malignant neoplasms of the urinary bladder, transitional cell neoplasms of the kidney, and benign and malignant neoplasms of the large intestine. There was a chemical-related increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats receiving diets containing 222, 666, or 2,000 ppm o-nitroanisole for 2 years. Marginally increased incidences of uncommon renal tubule neoplasms in male rats and forestomach neoplasms in male and female rats were considered uncertain findings. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of benign and malignant hepatocellular neoplasms. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas. Increased severity of nephropathy in male rats, and increased incidences of focal hyperplasia of the renal tubule epithelium and forestomach ulcers in male rats, and of transitional cell hyperplasia of the urinary bladder, focal hyperplasia of the forestomach, and hyperplasia of transitional epithelium of the kidney pelvis in male and female rats were associated with exposure to o-nitroanisole.

None of the compounds was mutagenic without norharman. In the presence of norharman, however, nitrobenzene, nitrotoluene, nitroanisole, nitrochlorobenzene and nitrobenzaldehyde exhibited mutagenicity only to S. typhimurium TA98 with S9 mix. This induction of mutagenesis with norharman was strong for the ortho isomers of every nitro-compound, weak for the para isomers, and was not observed for the meta isomers.",Is 100-02-7 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False

The new Pt(II) complexes exhibited high in vitro cytotoxicity on cisplatin sensitive and resistant cell lines and showed negligible reactivity with nucleobases (Guo and 5'-GMP) but selective substitution of DMSO/DMS with soft biological nucleophiles, such as L-methionine. In order to assess the ability of the new complexes with respect to cisplatin to induce apoptosis by interaction with nongenomic targets, the Ames' test, a standard reverse mutation assay, was carried out on two Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA98 and TA100). Interestingly, the new complexes did not show the well-known mutagenic activity exhibited by cisplatin and are, therefore, able to activate apoptotic pathways without interacting with DNA.",Is New platinum(II) complexes mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
683,"In the previous study (Mutation Res., this issue), we showed that increased levels of dietary casein as the sole protein source for male F344 rats decreased the ability of the uninduced liver S9s to activate 2-aminoanthracene (2AN) to a mutagen in strain TA98 using the spiral Salmonella mutagenicity assay. No effects of dietary casein levels were noted for the ability of uninduced liver S9s to activate the promutagens aflatoxin B1 (AFB) and benzo[a]pyrene (BAP). In the present study, we have extended this study to include liver S9s induced with either Aroclor 1254, phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC). S9s were derived from individual male F344 rats fed for 6 weeks on semisynthetic diets containing 8%, 12% or 22% methionine-supplemented casein as the sole source of protein (diets were made isocaloric by adjusting the corn starch content). Rats were housed in large, raised-bed cages by groups of three/diet/inducing agent. S9 activation mixtures were prepared at 5 mg of S9 protein/ml of S9 mix. Slopes from the linear portions of the mutagenicity dose-response curves were analyzed by ANOVA comparisons. Assays used to elucidate the phase I activities of microsomal preparations were cytochrome P-450 content, cytochrome-c reductase activity, flavin-containing monooxygenase activity, 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation (EROD) activity, N-demethylation of benzphetamine, and para-nitrophenol O-deethylation. Phase II activities were assayed by estimating glutathione (GSH) content and measuring the metabolism of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) by glutathione S-transferase in cytosolic preparations. None of the phase I or phase II endpoints were significantly affected by dietary casein levels. In general, increasing levels of dietary casein resulted in increased body and liver wet weight and amount of S9 protein. Aroclor-induced S9s from rats fed the 22% or 12% casein diet were most effective at activating AFB, depending on the lot of Aroclor used for induction; these divergent results were replicated with two groups of rats for each lot of Aroclor. The observed differences between Aroclor lots are assumed to arise from variation in the mix of PCB isomers. The Aroclor-induced S9s did not exhibit any casein-related effects for the activation of BAP or 2AN. For 3MC-induced S9s, the 12% casein diets produced S9s with the highest ability to activate AFB and BAP when standardized for protein content. Phenobarbital-induced S9s did not demonstrate any dietary casein-related effects on the activation of the three model promutagens. These results illustrate the complex interaction between dietary levels of casein, enzyme inducing agent and promutagen.",Is 2-aminoanthracene mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
684,"There is a presumption that copper and anthracycline drugs will interact with DNA to produce genotoxicity. This is of concern because serum copper levels are increased in certain neoplastic diseases. To test the interaction, it was determined if the metal ion could alter the mutagenesis of doxorubicin and related drugs in the Salmonella microsome test. In the standard form of the test, doxorubicin was strongly mutagenic against frameshift-sensitive strain TA98. When cupric acetate was added with doxorubicin it amplified the mutagenesis of the antineoplastic with an increase of approximately 19% in peak mutagenic values. This apparent ""chemoactivation"" was evaluated by additional applications of the Salmonella test. Preincubation of cupric acetate, drug, and bacteria (+/- rat liver S9 fraction) also resulted in a copper-amplifying effect. In the preincubation method copper produced a drug concentration-related increase of more than 700% in the mutagenicity of doxorubicin. This large an increase occurred without S9 in the test. The effects observed in TA98 were not seen with TA102, a strain sensitive to oxidation mechanisms. Copper amplification in the mutagenicity of a positive control, aflatoxin B1, was also observed with TA98 but these effects were not seen with the chelator, EDTA, the antifolate antineoplastic drug, methotrexate, or a test negative amino acid, methionine. Results point to a direct frameshift mechanism to explain the increase in mutagenicity with copper. Amplification of mutagenicity found in this study provides initial experimental support that anthracycline-metal ion-DNA associations might contribute to genotoxicity as has been inferred in the literature.",Is copper mutagenic for TA98 or TA102 strain?,True
685,"Ten different amino acid-glucose Maillard browning products before and after reaction with nitrite were evaluated by the Ames mutagenicity assay. No mutagenic response was observed in the methylene chloride extracts of any browning products tested before nitrosation. However, mutagenicity was showed in most of the browning mixtures, e.g., glycine-glucose, lysine-glucose (I), arginine-glucose, phenylalanine-glucose (II), and methionine-glucose after nitrosation when examined by Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 either with or without S-9 metabolic activation. Among the browning mixtures, (I) and (II) showed the greatest mutagenic activity after reaction with nitrite. The mutagenicity of lysine-glucose with nitrite was dependent on browning intensity, nitrosation pH, nitrosation time, nitrite level and blocking agents.",Is phenylalanine-glucose mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
686,"Nitrosation of dietary components has been combined with the 4-(para-nitrobenzyl)pyridine (NBP) colorimetric test for screening alkylating agents and with the Ames test for the detection of mutagenic activity. This allowed the investigation of short-lived nitrosation products of dietary components which generate electrophilic degradation products requiring no metabolic activation (natural amino acids and some derivatives, ureas, guanidines, primary alkyl and aryl amines). In a first system, precursor, nitrous acid and NBP were present simultaneously. All amino acids tested, except glutamic acid and glutamine, gave positive results. The reactivities spanned more than three orders of magnitude, with the aromatic amino acids and methionine the most active; two primary amines, tryptamine and histamine, were also strongly reactive. All guanidines tested, except the amino acid arginine, gave negative results. A second system consisted of two phases: NBP was added only after destruction of residual nitrite and adjustment of the pH to neutrality. This system was useful for the study of ureas, which are stable in acid but not in neutral media. The range of responses covered more than two orders of magnitude. Most amino acids and primary amines also gave positive results, but could be assessed only after analysing the kinetics of the competing reactions and choosing appropriate reaction times. In a third system, Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 replaced NBP. Representatives of the class of amino acids, ureas, the primary amine tryptamine, and aniline became highly mutagenic upon nitrosation. Methylguanidine was only weakly mutagenic under the present assay conditions. The results indicate that further studies with unstable nitrosation products of dietary components are required to understand more thoroughly the role of endogenous nitrosation in gastric cancer.",Is Methylguanidine mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True

Five strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA97, TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1538) were utilized for this purpose. Dose-response effects producing a two-fold increase of revertants over spontaneous levels were not observed with either S9 preparation indicating that the amino acid conjugates are not promutagens in these assays.","Is 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?",False

689,"Antimutagenic, anticlastogenic, and bioprotective effect of polysaccharide glucomannan (GM) isolated from Candida utilis was evaluated in four model test systems. The antimutagenic effect of GM against 9-aminoacridine (9-AA)- and sodium azide (NaN3)-induced mutagenicity was revealed in the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97 and TA100, respectively. GM showed anticlastogenic effect against N-nitroso-N'-methylurea (NMU) induced chromosome aberrations in the Vicia sativa assay. The bioprotective effect of GM co-treated with methyl-methane-sulphonate (MMS) was also established in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii repair deficient strains uvs10 and uvs14. The statistically significant antimutagenic potential of GM was not proved against 4-nitro-quinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO)-induced mutagenicity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7 assay. It may be due to bioprotectivity of alpha-mannan and beta-glucan, which are integral part of S. cerevisiae cell walls. Due to the good water solubility, low molecular weight (30 kDa), antimutagenic/anticlastogenic, and bioprotective activity against chemical compounds differing in mode of action, GM appears to be a promising natural protective (antimutagenic) agent.",Is 9-aminoacridine mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
690,"DL-p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) and its derivatives were evaluated for genotoxic effects using Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis strains lacking various DNA-repair mechanisms in spottest and in suspension test. The mutagenic activity of studied compounds was determined by the Ames test. Reverse mutation test was performed with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537 without S9 mix. 0.02 M nitrosomethylurea (NMU) standard mutagen was used as a positive control. The results showed that the parent nonessential amino acid PCPA had no detectable genotoxic and mutagenic activities in bacteria. The methyl ester of this amino acid and its N-phenylacetyl derivative possessed weak genotoxicity. Meanwhile N-sec-butyloxycarbonyl, N-benzyloxycarbonyl, N-(p-nitrophenylacetyl) and N-(p-nitrophenoxyacetyl) derivatives of DL-p-chlorophenylalanine exhibited appreciable genotoxicity. Among the seven tested compounds only N-benzyloxycarbonyl and N-(p-nitrophenoxyacetyl) derivatives of DL-p-chlorophenylalanine have been found to be mutagenic. Only parent PCPA possessed antimutagenic properties in respect of nitrosomethylurea.

When using threshold concentrations of NMU the potentiation of mutagenesis reached 625.2%. The addition of 0.19 mg/ml of caffeine to the nutrient medium also led (though the action was less pronounced) to an increase in sensitivity of bacterial cells to the NMU mutagenic action.

In addition to direct plate tests with five tester strains (TA1535, TA100, TA1537, TA1538, TA98), the azo dyes were also assayed after chemical reduction to their component amines. Also, a selected group of azo dyes was subjected to liquid tests (both aerobic with microsomes and anaerobic) and to plate tests involving initial 16 h anaerobic incubations to facilitate microbial reduction of the azo bond. None of the presently listed FD and C colors was mutagenic in any of the test modifications. Among formerly listed colors only Butter Yellow (p-dimethylaminoazobenzene), a recognized animal carcinogen, was mutagenic in the aerobic liquid test.

693,"Retinol (vitamin A) has earlier been shown to inhibit the mutagenicity of o-aminoazotoluene (OAAT) in the Salmonella/microsome assay when OAAT is activated with S9 from Sprague-Dawley rats. The results presented in this paper confirm this and also show that S9 from mice, hamsters and gerbils activates OAAT to mutagenic metabolites detected by Salmonella typhimurium TA100. However, S9 from rabbits is inactive. The S9 fraction from rabbits also shows a low aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity. The AHH activity or protein content of the microsomal fraction cannot be used to predict the activating capacity of S9 from the other species. Retinol, added in vitro, inhibits the mutagenic effect of OAAT activated by mouse, gerbil or hamster S9.

694,"The mutagenicities of 15 naturally occurring anthraquinones were examined in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100 and TA2637 by the preincubation method. 7 of the 15 compounds tested, i.e., chrysazin, emodin, islandicin, alizarin, chrysophanol, 2-hydroxyanthraquinone and emodic acid, were strong mutagens in strain TA2637 with metabolic activation. All of these compounds contain 1-3 hydroxyl groups, and some also have methyl groups. Cynodontin, an anthraquinone with 4 hydroxyl groups and 1 methyl group, was only slightly mutagenic in strain TA2637. 2-Hydroxyanthraquinone, alizarin, emodin, islandicin and chrysazin were also mutagenic in strain TA100 with S9 mix. All the bisanthraquinones tested, i.e., skyrin, (+)rugulosin, (-)luteoskyrin, (-)rubroskyrin and sennoside A, were non-mutagenic in this test system with or without metabolic activation. Unsubstituted anthraquinone and anthrone were also non-mutagenic. These results show that hydroxyl substituents are necessary for the mutagenicity of anthraquinones, the optimal substitutions being 1-3 hydroxyl groups per molecule.

None of the compounds was mutagenic without norharman. In the presence of norharman, however, nitrobenzene, nitrotoluene, nitroanisole, nitrochlorobenzene and nitrobenzaldehyde exhibited mutagenicity only to S. typhimurium TA98 with S9 mix.

696,"This study investigated the mutagenic, anti-mutagenic and cytotoxic effects of acetone extract of raspberry, Rubus idaeus L. (v. Ottawa) Rosaceae, and the isolated and characterized ellagitannin and anthocyanin fractions thereof, suitable for food applications. The studied raspberry extract and fractions did not show any mutagenic effects determined in the miniaturized Ames test and were not cytotoxic to Caco-2 cells at the used concentrations. However, the anti-mutagenic properties were changed (i.e. decreased mutagenicity of 2-nitrofluorene in strain TA98, and slightly increased mutagenicity of 2-aminoanthracene in strain TA100) with metabolic activation. Further, their influence on the permeability of co-administered common drugs (ketoprofen, paracetamol, metoprolol and verapamil) across Caco-2 monolayers was evaluated. The apical-to-basolateral permeability of highly permeable verapamil was mostly affected (decreased) during co-administration of the raspberry extract or the ellagitannin fraction. Ketoprofen permeability was decreased by the ellagitannin fraction. Consumption of food rich in phytochemicals, as demonstrated here with chemically characterized raspberry extract and fractions, with well-absorbing drugs would seem to affect the permeability of some of these drugs depending on the components.

The pyrolyzates are potent mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines formed during cooking. Solution of these amines was mixed with aqueous suspension of bacterial cells or dietary fibers, and removal of these amines from the reaction mixture by centrifugation was defined as the binding. Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 were effectively bound to all gram-positive and some gram-negative bacterial cells, corn bran, apple pulp, and soy bean fiber. Binding of Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and cellulose was moderate, and to chitin and chitosan it was little. None but corn bran bound Glu-P-1 and Glu-P-2 effectively. Corn bran effectively bound all mutagens tested. The quantity of the binding of IQ, MeIQ, and MeIQx was dependent on the strain of bacteria and the kind of fiber. The mechanism of binding of Trp-P-2 to freeze-dried feces, Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC9018), and corn bran was investigated. The binding was pH dependent, occurred instantaneously, and was inhibited by the addition of metal salts. These results indicate that the binding was mostly due to a cation-exchange mechanism, but some irreversible binding of Trp-P-2 was observed, most notably to freeze-dried feces.

698,"It was previously reported that magnolol strongly inhibited the mutagenicity induced by the indirect mutagens [benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-aminodipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-2), 2-aminoanthracene (2AA), and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)] in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 in the Ames test, and that the mechanism of this anti-mutagenic effect may involve the inhibition of the metabolic activation of indirect mutagen enzymes. In this study, the in vivo anti-clastogenic effect of magnolol against clastogenicity induced by B(a)P was evaluated using the micronucleus test in mice. Animals were treated with an oral administration of magnolol (1, 10, and 100 mg/kg) at -24, 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h before a single intraperitoneal injection of B(a)P. Peripheral blood specimens were prepared 48 h after administration of B(a)P, and analyzed by the acridine orange (AO) technique. The results indicated that magnolol inhibited clastogenicity induced by B(a)P at various administration times. In order to elucidate the mechanism behind this effect, we measured the activity of the detoxifying enzymes [UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)] and antioxidative enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase] in the liver when treated with an oral administration of magnolol at various administration times. Its effect on clastogenicity created by exposure to oxidative DNA damage-inducing X-ray irradiation was also evaluated using the micronucleus test in mice. Results showed that magnolol increased the activity of both UGT and SOD enzymes, and also inhibited the clastogenicity induced by X-ray irradiation. Magnolol had an anti-clastogenic effect on B(a)P in the micronucleus test as well as an anti-mutagenic effect on indirect mutagens in the Ames test. The anti-clastogenic effect of magnolol was also suggested by the increases in UGT and SOD enzyme activity, and by the attenuation of oxidative damage induced by X-ray irradiation.",Is magnolol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
699,"Paper strips containing indicator dyes have been developed by defence scientists to change color upon exposure to certain agents but not to common solvents. As a preliminary step in studies on their possible genetic or carcinogenic hazard, 6 dyes used in these detection papers were tested with the Salmonella/mammalian-microsome assay. The 3 nitro arenes tested were found to be mutagenic. Two of them, Orasol Navy Blue 2RB (without metabolic activation) and Eastman Fast Blue B-GLF (with metabolic activation), induced higher yields of mutations in the frameshift revertible strains, but base substitution mutations also were found. The third nitro arene, ethyl-bis-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) acetate, induced only frameshift reversions, the greatest yields without metabolic activation. Because of weak but consistent mutagenic activation. Because of weak but consistent mutagenic effects with a fourth dye, thiodiphenyl-4,4'-diazo-bis-salicylic acid, fluctuation tests using Salmonella strain TA98 were performed, and dose-related, statistically-significant mutagenic responses were observed. Two remaining dyes, Fluorescent Brilliant Yellow R and 2,5,2',5'-tetramethyltriphenylmethane-4,4'-diazo-bis-beta-hydroxynaphthoic anilide, were not mutagenic in experiments using doses extending into the toxic range. Spot tests were performed on different paper strips containing the dyes. When the papers were eluted with dimethyl sulfoxide, responses were found to be qualitatively similar to those in the plate tests. Although microbial test results cannot be used to assess risk in man, these results indicate a potential mutagenic or carcinogenic hazard for individuals exposed to these dyes, especially the nitro aromatics.",Is Eastman Fast Blue B-GLF mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
700,"Benzophenone (BPs) and 4-Methylbenzylidene Camphor are used as ultraviolet (UV) filters to protect the skin and hair in personal care products. The discharging of the three chemicals may endanger the receiving water ecosystem. In the present study, the mutagenicity of BP-6, BP-8, and 4-Methylbenzylidene Camphor was tested using the Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation test (Ames test) in the system with and without rat liver microsomal preparations (S9). Four S.typhimurium strains, TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA102 were employed in the Ames tests. The mutagenicity was detected from all three chemicals. The addition of S9 increased the mutation ratios of three chemicals to four strains, except BP-6 to TA100 strain and 4-MBC to TA97 and TA98 strain. In the mixed experiment, all positive effects were detected in the absence of S9. However, the results all became negative in the presence of S9. For the mixture of BP-6 and 4-MBC, positive results were detected on four tester strains except for the TA100 strain. For the mixture of BP-6, BP-8, and 4-MBC, positive results were detected on four strains. The mixture test results showed antagonism in mutagenicity for the mixture of BP-6 and 4-MBC to TA98 and TA100 strains and the mixture of BP-6, BP-8, and 4-MBC to TA100 and TA102 strains.",Is Benzophenone mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
701,"Unpolymerized dental monomers can leach out into the oral biophase and are bioavailable for metabolism. We hypothesize that metabolites would be less toxic than parent monomers. We first identified the formation of metabolites from bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE) and Bisphenol A glycidyl methacrylate (BISGMA) after their exposure to liver S9 fractions. Then, the metabolites and parent compounds were subjected to in vitro cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and estrogenicity studies. Bisphenol A bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether and bisphenol F bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether were the hydroxylated metabolites of BISGMA and BFDGE, respectively. Cytotoxicity against L929 cells showed that the metabolites were significantly (p < 0.05) less cytotoxic than the parent monomers. Only BFDGE was mutagenic in the Ames assay with strain TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium. Parent and metabolite compounds did not stimulate estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cell proliferation above solvent controls. These results indicated that the hydroxylated metabolites were non-mutagenic, non-estrogenic, and less cytotoxic than their parent monomers.",Is bisphenol F diglycidyl ether mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
702,"Fifteen hospitalized, non-smoking, dermatological patients were treated with ointment containing 2% coal tar (CT) in order to assess the influence of metabolic genotype GSTM1 on urinary mutagen levels. Urinary 1-pyrenol, the main metabolite of pyrene, was used to check the high exposure to PAH of this population. The mean levels of urinary 1-pyrenol found in the 24-h urine of our patients were 467. 8+/-211.0 nmoles-24 h (range 94.6-890.1 nmoles-24 h). Mutagenicity was assessed on urine samples collected over a period of 24 h, after three consecutive days of topical application, using the bacterial mutagenesis test on Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and YG1024 in the presence of microsomal enzymes. The latter strain turned out to be more sensitive than the former in revealing urinary mutagens in these patients (42 693+/-30 867 vs. 6877+/-6040 net revertants-24 h). The mutagenicity on YG1024 strain and 1-pyrenol levels of urine samples were correlated (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient=0. 6678, P<0.01, z=2.795). The influence of genotype GSTM1 on urinary mutagen levels was assessed on strain YG1024. The values of urinary mutagenicity of subjects with genotype GSTM1-null (n=6) were on average higher than those of GSTM1-positive subjects (n=9) (55 498+/-45 957 vs. 34 156+/-11 933 net rev.-24 h), a non-significant statistical difference. The mean total excretion of mutagens corrected for PAH exposure (net rev./nmoles of urinary 1-pyrenol) in GSTM1-null patients was double that of GSTM1-positive ones (136. 8+/-34.7 vs. 70.8+/-23.3 net rev./nmoles of urinary 1-pyrenol; one-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test, U=11.5, P<0.05). These results indicate a greater body burden of promutagens, resulting from skin application of CT, in GSTM1-null subjects.",Is CT mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
703,"The response of mutagenicity to the stepwise replacement of chlorine atoms and the hydroxyl group by hydrogen in 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX, 1) was determined in several assays by using Salmonella typhimurium tester strain (TA100). In all, eight MX derivatives were assayed. Several were studied together in at least one assay. In addition to MX, the seven included 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (RMX, 2), 3-chloro-4-(chloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (3), 3-chloro-4-(chloromethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (4), 4-(chloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (5), 4-chloromethyl-2(5H)-furanone (6), and 4-(dichloromethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (8). Compounds 1-6 were mutagenic. Compound 8 gave erratic results. 4-(Acetoxymethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (11) was nonmutagenic. The largest drop in mutagenicity amounted to a factor of about 10(2) for the replacement of the hydroxyl group or a C-3 chlorine atom from 3. Other replacements of the hydroxyl group or a C-3 or C-6 chlorine atom amounted to mutagenicity diminished by a factor of only 10. On the basis of the rates of UV spectral changes under assay conditions, chemical half-life values (ct 1/2) for 1-6 and 8 were estimated as indicators of compound stability. However, mutagenicity differences were shown to result principally from the intrinsic mutagenicities of the six compounds 1-6 rather than from differences in stability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Is 3-chloro-4-(chloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
704,"7H-Dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (DBC) has carcinogenic effects on mouse subcutaneous fibroblasts and liver; the N-methyl derivative (N-MeDBC) induces only sarcomas; 3-methyl- and 5,9-dimethyldibenzo[c,g]carbazole (3-MeDBC and 5,9-DMeDBC) are specific, potent hepatocarcinogens in mice. The mutagenicity in S. typhimurium TA100 of these 4 compounds was evaluated in relation to the concentration of mouse liver 9000 X g supernatant (S9) and to the proportions of microsomes and cytosol in the medium. Optimal mutagenicity of N-MeDBC was seen with a low concentration of S9 or microsomes; a 5-10 times higher concentration of the subcellular fraction was necessary to induce optimal mutagenicity of the hepatocarcinogens 3-MeDBC and 5,9-DMeDBC. Intermediate quantities were needed in the case of DBC, which is carcinogenic in both cell types. Whereas the presence of cytosol had an inhibitory effect on the mutagenicity of the sarcomagenic N-MeDBC, the cytosolic fraction was essential for optimal mutagenic expression by the 2 hepatocarcinogenic derivatives. The activating cytosolic fraction is not inducible. These experiments show that programmed modulation of the metabolic activation system in the Ames test can be used to study organ-specific chemical carcinogenesis. The results suggest that differences in the enzymatic composition of target tissues are a determining factor in the organ specificity of carcinogens such as DBC.","Is 7H-Dibenzo[c,g]carbazole mutagenic for TA100 strain?",True
705,"7H-Dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (DBC) is a potent carcinogen of environmental import. Reverse-mutation plate-incorporation assays for mutagenicity were undertaken in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. Results were negative when no exogenous activation system was used, as well as when assays incorporated liver homogenates (S9) from rats, mice and rabbits. By contrast DBC was mutagenic in a forward mutation assay in Salmonella strain TM677 using resistance to 8-azaguanine for selection. Metabolites of DBC were generated by incubation with rat-liver microsomes and separated by HPLC. Two of these metabolites were directly mutagenic for Salmonella strain TM 677 while two others were mutagenic upon addition of S9. Synthetic phenolic derivatives of DBC were also mutagenic in this assay when further metabolized. It is likely that metabolites of DBC phenols constitute the biologically active forms.","Is 7H-Dibenzo[c,g]carbazole mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?",True
706,"The mutagenicity of the commonly used glutathione S-transferase substrates 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene (DCNB) was investigated in the Salmonella mutagenicity assay. CDNB induced a concentration-dependent mutagenic response in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98. Incorporation of an activation system derived from Aroclor 1254-induced rats did not influence mutagenic response. Under the same conditions DCNB failed to display mutagenic activity. The mutagenic activity of CDNB was attenuated in bacterial strains under-expressing nitroreductase or O-acetylase activity but, in contrast, it was exaggerated in an O-acetylase over-expressing strain. It is inferred that CDNB exhibits a mutagenic response following reduction of the nitro-group to the hydroxylamine, which is further acetylated to form the acetoxy derivative that presumably breaks down spontaneously to generate the nitrenium ion, the likely ultimate mutagen.",Is DCNB mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
707,"Elderberry (EDB) Sambucus nigra L. is one of the oldest medicinal plants which is useful for therapeutic and nutritional purposes due to a large amount of biologically active constituents, including compounds with a high antioxidant capacity. The present study focused on the antioxidant potential of the colon-available EDB fruit extract, derived from the artificial gastrointestinal tract, with regard to human colonic mucosa cells cultured in vitro. Despite the significant loss of EDB bioactive compounds due to the digestion process, the colon-digested extract was able to reduce the excessive intracellular ROS production (22%) and oxidative DNA damage (46%) in the colon cells at a dose of 1 mg of freeze-dried EDB powder/ml. Moreover, the colon-digested EDB extract inhibited oxidant-induced mutagenicity (26%) in the Salmonella typhimurium TA102 strain, as determined by the Ames test. In conclusion, the current in vitro study confirmed that the fruits of S. nigra are capable of protecting colonic cells against the detrimental effects of oxidative stress.",Is EDB mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False
708,"A total of 228 pesticides (88 insecticides, 60 fungicides, 62 herbicides, 12 plant-growth regulators, 3 metabolites and 3 other compounds) was tested for mutagenicity in bacterial reversion-assay systems with 5 strains (TA100, TA98, TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538) of Salmonella typhimurium and a strain (WP2 hcr) of Escherichia coli. 50 pesticides (25 insecticides, 20 fungicides, 3 herbicides, 1 plant-growth regulator and 1 other compound) were found to be mutagenic. 5 of them required metabolic activation (S9 mix) for their activities. Among various chemical groups, organic phosphates, halogenated alkanes and dithiocarbamates showed higher ratios of mutagens. Although 22 of the pesticides tested have been reported to be carcinogenic, 7 of them, i.e., captain, DBCP, EDB, EDC, ETU, HEH and nitrofen, were detected as mutagens in the present assay.

709,"The Escherichia coli mu operon was subcloned into a pKK233-2 vector containing rat glutathione S-transferase (GST) 5-5 cDNA and the plasmid thus obtained was introduced into Salmonella typhimurium TA1535. The newly developed strain S.typhimurium NM5004, was found to have 52-fold greater GST activity than the original umu strain S.typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. We compared sensitivities of these two tester strains, NM5004 and TA1535/pSK1002, for induction of umuC gene expression with several dihaloalkanes which are activated or inactivated by GST 5-5 activity. The induction of umuC gene expression by these chemicals was monitored by measuring the cellular beta-galactosidase activity produced by umuC""lacZ fusion gene in these two tester strains. Ethylene dibromide, 1-bromo-2-chloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and methylene dichloride induced umuC gene expression more strongly in the NM5004 strain than the original strain. 4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine were found to induce umuC gene expression to similar extents in both strains. In the case of 1-nitropyrene and 2-nitrofluorene, however, NM5004 strain showed weaker umuC gene expression responses than the original TA1535/pSK1002 strain. 1,2-Epoxy-3-(4'-nitrophenoxy)propane, a known substrate for GST 5-5, was found to inhibit umuC induction caused by 1-bromo-2-chloroethane.

712,"Synthetic dyes are released in wastewater from textile manufacturing plants, and many of these dyes are genotoxic. In the present study, the mutagenicity of azo, anthraquinone, and triphenyl methane dyes was investigated before and after successive biodegradation with activated sludge and the ligninolytic fungus, Irpex lacteus. Two biodegradation systems were used to reduce the genotoxicity of dyes that were not efficiently inactivated by activated sludge alone. Mutagenicity was monitored with the Salmonella reversion assay conducted with the base-pair substitution detector strains, TA100 and YG1042, and the frame-shift detector strains, TA98 and YG1041, with and without rat liver S9. All dyes except for Congo Red (CR) were mutagenic with S9 activation. Assays conducted with the dyes indicated that only the azo dye Reactive Orange 16 (RO16) was mutagenic in both TA98 and TA100. Methyl Red and Disperse Blue 3 (DB3) were mutagenic in TA98, YG1041 and YG1042, while Reactive Black 5 was mutagenic in YG1041 and YG1042. Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR), Crystal violet (CV) and Bromophenol Blue (BPB) were mutagenic only in TA98, but the toxicity of the latter two dyes complicated the evaluation of their mutagenicity. CR was not mutagenic in any of the tester strains. Biodegradation studies conducted with RO16 and DB3 indicated that the two-step biodegradation process reduced the mutagenic potential of RO16 and DB3 to a greater extent than activated sludge alone; the mutagenicity of the two dyes was reduced by 95.2% and 77.8%, respectively, by the two-step process.

Our of 48 species tested, 37 exhibited a significant but for the most part weak activity. The activity observed in the presence of S9 mix was typically between 0 and 50% of that without, and in no case was the activity increased in the presence of microsomal enzymes. Six metabolites reported to occur in some of the species included in this investigation were also tested. Significant mutagenic activity was found with isovelleral (5) from Lactarius sp., agaritine (3) from Agaricus bisporus and related sp. and beta-nitraminoalanine (7) from Agaricus silvaticus. Isovelleral may be a major mutagen in some of the sharp-tasting and mutagenic Russulaceae sp. A. bisporus (cultivated specimen) was weakly mutagenic toward all three strains of S. typhimurium, used, and agaritine was weakly active toward TA2637 alone. This implies that this fungus might contain other mutagenic material as well. beta-Nitraminoalanine was not found in the particular collection of A. silvaticus tested here. The mutagenicity observed for the fungus in this work may therefore be due to other metabolites. Even though many species found to be mutagenic are used as food, it seems premature to make specific recommendations about eventual health risks.

718,"Pleurotus cornucopiae (PC) mushroom with a brilliant yellow pileus is found in the field and known in Japan as Tamogi dake mushroom. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mechanism of the antimutagenic effect of PC mushroom using both the Ames test and Comet assay. We have found a strong inhibitory effect of both aqueous and organic PC extracts on the mutagenicity elicited by benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). This inhibition was dose-dependent in reaction mixtures containing cytosolic and microsomal fractions (S-9) from untreated rat liver as well as in those containing S-9 from aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ah) ligand of Sudan III-treated rats. Sudan III was a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) activity. We treated rats with Sudan III to enhance the metabolic activation of B[a]P by the S-9 fraction. To explain whether this antimutagenicity was due to the inhibition of CYP1A activity that metabolically activates B[a]P, we tested the effects of the extracts on activities of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, represented by ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and methoxyresorufin O-demethylase (MROD), respectively. Both aqueous and organic extracts inhibited EROD activity at all dose levels, while the inhibitory effect was only observed at high doses with regard to MROD activity. Furthermore, pre-treatment of Chinese hamster V79cells with PC extracts significantly reduced H2O2-induced-DNA damage, indicating that PC extracts provide a protective effect against oxidative DNA damage. These results indicate that whole-mushroom extracts contain compounds that may inhibit the metabolic activation of B[a]P by CYP1A1 as well as prevent oxidative DNA damage.",Is Pleurotus cornucopiae mutagenic for nan strain?,False

Because exposure to MEKP is typically through dermal contact, 2-week and 13-week toxicity studies were conducted by topical application of MEKP in DMP (45:55 w/w) to the clipped dorsal region of male and female Fischer 344/N rats and mice. Animals were evaluated for histopathology and for reproductive endpoints. In vitro genetic toxicity studies of MEKP included assessments of mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium and in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells and analysis of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In addition, the peripheral blood of mice from the 13-week study was evaluated in the micronucleus assay. In the 2-week studies, groups of 5 animals of each species and sex were administered MEKP in DMP for 5 days per week at doses of 50.6, 101.3, 202.5, 405, and 810 mg/kg body weight per day for rats and 112.5, 225, 450, 900, and 1800 mg/kg body weight per day for mice. Control groups received DMP or no treatment. No rats died during the studies, but at least 1 mouse in each group receiving MEKP died. Body weight gains of rats decreased with increasing doses of MEKP; body weight gains of mice were not affected by treatment. The primary effects of topical administration of MEKP in both rats and mice were an extensive coagulative necrosis of the epidermis and dermis, variable degrees of inflammation of the adnexa, and epidermal regeneration and hyperplasia at the application site. Lesions considered secondary to the dermal lesions included increased hematopoiesis in the spleen in rats and mice and increased myeloid hyperplasia of the bone marrow in mice, primarily at the higher doses. Mice showed a marked, dose-related increase in liver weight. In the 13-week dermal studies, groups of 10 rats and 10 mice of each sex were administered MEKP in DMP for 5 days per week at doses of 1.07, 3.57, 10.7, 35.7, and 107 mg/rat and 0.357, 1.19, 3.57, 11.9, and 35.7 mg/mouse. All high-dose mice, 3 high-dose female rats, and 1 female mouse in the 11.9 mg/animal group died or were sacrificed during the first week of the studies. Skin lesions similar to those seen in the 2-week studies were judged of sufficient severity to warrant early termination of surviving rats and mice in the 2 highest dose groups. All rats and mice in the remaining dose groups survived to the end of the studies, and weight gains were generally lower with increasing doses of MEKP. Skin lesions at the application site for the remaining animals (rats and mice) in the 10.7 mg/rat and 3.57 mg/mouse dose groups involved a spectrum of necrosis, inflammation, and acanthosis (epidermal hyperplasia). Lesions in the lower dose groups were limited to acanthosis and hyperkeratosis in rats (1.07 and 3.57 mg/rat) and acanthosis in mice (0.357 and 1.19 mg/mouse). While splenic and bone marrow lesions similar to those described in the 2-week studies were seen in animals that died early in the 13-week studies and in the rats and mice that showed ulcerative or necrotic injury, no other systemic changes were noted in animals that did not show ulcerative skin lesions. In genetic toxicity studies, MEKP in DMP (45:55 w/w) was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA1537, or TA98, with or without S9activation. A positive response was obtained in the mouse lymphoma assay for induction of trifluorothymidine resistance in L5178Y cells without S9. In cytogenetic tests with Chinese hamster ovary cells, MEKP induced sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations, with and without S9. No increase in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes was observed in peripheral blood samples obtained from male and female mice at the termination of the 13-week toxicity study. In summary, topical administration of MEKP in DM of MEKP in DMP resulted in a spectrum of necrotic, inflammatory, and regenerative skin lesions limited to the application site. Histopathologic changes in the spleen and bone marrow were also seen in rats and mice with ulcerative skin lesions, and were considered a secondary response. A no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for histopathologic skin lesions could not be determined from these studies, as lesions were observed with administration of daily doses as low as 1.07 mg for rats and 0.357 mg for mice.

723,"The anti-neoplastic agent procarbazine is genetically active in a variety of short term mutagenicity tests, and it also possesses carcinogenic and teratogenic potential. This compound has consistently yielded false negative results in in vitro microbial mutagenicity tests in the presence and absence of mammalian metabolic activation. In this study, procarbazine was not mutagenic in standard and preincubation Ames tests using large S9 concentrations and bacterial test strains devoid of the rfa mutation. The microtitre fluctuation test is a sensitive technique for the detection of bacterial mutagens. Using this assay, procarbazine proved to be a bacterial mutagen after in vitro metabolic activation at concentrations as low as 200 micrograms/ml. Activity was dependent upon liver S9-concentrations which were higher than those usually attained within agar assays, and was only observed when such fractions were derived from aroclor-treated or phenobarbitone plus beta-naphthoflavone treated rat livers. The excision-repair proficient strain E. coli WP2 was equally, if not more, sensitive than the repair deficient strain E. coli WP2 uvrA. Furthermore, the differential mutagenic effects obtained using S. typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1530 and his G46 indicated that the absence of an rfa mutation was essential for procarbazine mutagenesis. Procarbazine was also mutagenic for E. coli D494 in a forward mutation fluctuation assay measuring resistance to ampicillin. In this assay lower concentrations of S9-fraction were sufficient, reflecting the increased sensitivity of the test strain towards the mutagenic metabolites of the drug. In conclusion, the results suggest that rat liver S9-fraction contains only low levels of enzymes capable of activating procarbazine to a mutagen. This may be a result of rapid breakdown during storage, or due to intrinsically low levels in rat liver extracts. Inducing agents appear to increase these levels. The low concentrations of mutagenic species formed in vitro, may only be detectable using a highly sensitive assay such as the microtitre fluctuation test.",Is Procarbazin mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
724,"14 pesticides were tested as pure compounds for the induction of point mutations in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium--TA1535, TA1536, TA1537 and TA1538--in the presence and in the absence of rat-liver microsomal fractions and for the induction of resistance to low concentrations of streptomycin in the filamentous bacterium, Streptomyces coelicolor. The technique used was essentially the so-called ""spot test"". The pesticides investigated were: aminotriazole, Benomyl, Captafol, Captan, Dichlorvos, Dalapon-Na, Dinobuton, Dodine, Ioxynil, Mecoprop, Neburon, Picloram, Triallate and Trichlorphon. In Salmonella, Captan and Triallate were mutagenic on the TA1535 strain; Dichlorvos and Trichlorphon were negative in the spot test but mutagenic after incubation in liquid cultures of strain TA1535. By using the S. coelicolor forward-mutation test, aminotriazole, Dichlorvos, Picloram, Trichlorphon and Triallate were mutagenic with the ""spot test"" technique; Captan showed a weak mutagenic activity with a ""plate-incorporated"" technique.",Is Dichlorvos mutagenic for TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
725,"Previously, Alternaria extract and metabolite mutagenicities+/-nitrosylation were characterized using Ames Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100, which are both reverted at GC sites. To examine other targets for mutation, the metabolites Altertoxin I (ATX I), Altenuene (ALT), Alternariol (AOH), Alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), Tentoxin (TENT), Tenuazonic acid (TA) and Radicinin (RAD) were reexamined+/-nitrosylation, using Ames Salmonella strain TA97, sensitive to frameshift mutations at a run of C's, as well as strains TA102 and TA104, reverted by base pair mutations at AT sites and more sensitive to oxidative damage. ATX I was also assessed for mammalian mutagenicity at the Hprt gene locus in Chinese hamster V79 lung fibroblasts and rat hepatoma H4IIE cells. When tested from 1 to 100 microg/plate without nitrosylation, ATX I was mutagenic in TA102+/-rat liver S9 for activation and weakly mutagenic in TA104+/-S9, demonstrating direct-acting AT base pair mutagenicity. AOH was also directly mutagenic at AT sites in TA102+/-S9 while AME was weakly mutagenic in TA102+/-S9 and TA104+S9. Nitrosylation of ATX I enhanced mutagenicity at AT sites in TA104+/-S9 but produced little change in TA102+/-S9 compared to native ATX I. However, nitrosylated ATX I generated a potent direct-acting frameshift mutagen at C sites in TA97+/-S9. While ATX I was not mutagenic in either V79 cells or H4IIE cells, 5 and 10 microg/ml nitrosylated ATX I produced a doubling of 6-thioguanine resistant V79 colonies and 0.5 and 1 microg/ml were mutagenic to H4IIE cells, becoming toxic at higher concentrations. These results suggest ATX I, AME and AOH induce mutations at AT sites, possibly through oxidative damage, with nitrosylation enhancing ATX I frameshift mutagenicity at runs of C's. Nitrosylated ATX I was also directly mutagenic in mammalian test systems.",Is Altertoxin I mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
726,"Molds of the genus Alternaria are common food pathogens responsible for the spoilage of fruits, vegetables, grains, and nuts. Although consumption of Alternaria alternata-contaminated foodstuffs has been implicated in an elevated incidence of esophageal carcinogenesis, the mutagenic potencies of several A. alternata toxins seem unable to account for the levels of activity found using crude mycelial extracts. In this study, the mutagenic effects of nitrosylation were examined with the major Alternaria metabolites Altenuene (ALT), Alternariol (AOH), Alternariol Monomethyl Ether (AME), Altertoxin I (ATX I), Tentoxin (TENT), Tenuazonic Acid (TA), and Radicinin (RAD) using the Ames Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100. In the absence of nitrosylation, ATX I was mutagenic when tested from 1 to 100 microg/plate in TA98 with rat liver S9 for activation, while AOH and ATX I were weakly mutagenic +/- S9 in TA100. Incubation with nitrite generally increased mutagenic potencies with ATX I strongly mutagenic +/- S9 in both TA98 and TA100, while ALT, AOH, AME, and RAD responses were enhanced in TA100 + S9. However, subsequent examination of three extracts made from A. alternata culture broth, acetone-washed mycelia, and the acetone washes showed a different mutagenic response with both broth and acetone washes directly mutagenic in TA98 and TA100 but with a reduced response + S9. The acetone-washed mycelial extract was found to have the lowest mutagenic activity of the three extracts tested. Nitrosylation had little effect on the mutagenicity of any of the extracts. Thus, while nitrosylation increases the mutagenicity of ATX I, and to a lesser extent that of several other Alternaria toxins, the results demonstrate that Alternaria produces a major mutagenic activity with a S. typhimurium response different from that found with the purified toxins. Efforts are currently underway to chemically identify this mutagenic species. Published 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Is ATX I mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
727,"The mutagenicity of three propionic acid derivatives, namely ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen, was tested in the Ames mutagenicity assay (in strains TA97a, TA100 and TA102) and in vivo genotoxicity was tested by sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in bone marrow cells of mice. These are the anti-inflammatory drugs frequently used in different parts of the world. Mutagenicity results showed no mutagenic effects in strains TA97a, TA100 and TA102 for all three drugs. Results of in vivo SCE assays indicate that these three drugs are weakly genoxic in bone marrow cells of mice. This is the first report of the Ames mutagenicity assay for ketoprofen and in vivo SCE assay for three drugs.",Is ketoprofen mutagenic for TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
728,"The antimutagenic effect of dialysed cell extracts of 4 strains of propionic acid bacteria was examined against the mutagenicity of sodium azide in the TA1535 tester strain of Salmonella typhimurium using the Ames test. It was noted that dialysates of 2 strains of Propionibacterium shermanii, P. pentosaceum and P. acnes, significantly reduced sodium azide-induced revertants. The dialysate of propionic acid cocci did not show an antimutagenic effect. The inhibitory activity was enhanced if the mutagen and extract were coincubated for 20 min prior to performing the mutagenicity assay. Antimutagenicity of dialysates from P. shermanii VKM-103 against MNNG and 9-aminoacridine was shown in S. typhimurium strains TA1535 and TA97. The antimutagenic activity was found in the protein fraction of the cell extract of P. shermanii. The proteins of the dialysate of P. shermanii were separated using a Toyopearl gel column into 3 main peaks according to their molecular weights. The antimutagenic activity towards sodium azide was found in the second and the third peaks. We suggest that dialysates of the cells of propionic acid bacteria contain several kinds of antimutagenic substances with different molecular weights.",Is propionic acid mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,False
729,"Thalomid is the FDA-approved commercial formulation of thalidomide currently used in the US to treat erythema nodosum leprosum, a complication of leprosy. The genotoxicity of Thalomid thalidomide was assessed in the Ames reverse mutation, AS52/XPRT mammalian cell forward gene mutation, and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assays. The Ames and AS52 assays were performed with and without S9. In the Ames, Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, 1537, 98, 100, and 102 and Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA were used. Assays were performed by using plate incorporation and liquid pre-incubation systems at thalidomide doses of 50-10,000 microg/plate. In the AS52 assay, Chinese hamster ovary cells were plated with fortified Ham's F12 medium and incubated overnight. The medium was then incubated with 1-1000 microg/ml thalidomide. After a series of aspirations, washings, reconstitutions, and incubations, mutant AS52 cells were fixed and stained. Colonies were then counted and the relative survival frequencies compared to negative controls. In the mouse micronucleus assay, Crl:CD-1 albino mice were dosed with 500, 2,500, and 5,000 mg/kg thalidomide and sacrificed over 72 h. Femurs were flushed with fetal bovine serum and the suspensions centrifuged. The supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet resuspended and stained. Polychromatic erythrocytes were scored for micronucleated polychromatic and normochromatic erythrocytes. Thalidomide did not increase revertant frequencies in all bacterial strains.

730,"The human and rabbit teratogen thalidomide has been tested for mutagenicity in a wide range of assays, ranging from bacterial gene mutation assays conducted in vitro to in vivo cytogenetic assays conducted using rabbits, and including a variety of human-derived tissues. Thalidomide was not mutagenic to 6 strains of Salmonella when tested both in the presence and absence of Aroclor-induced rat liver S9 mix. This inactivity was confirmed in strains TA98 and TA100 using a 1-h pre-incubation assay protocol with the same S9 mix (10% S9), and additionally, in strain TA98 using 3 concentrations of S9 (4%, 10% and 30% S9 in S9 mix). Thalidomide was not clastogenic either to cultured human lymphocytes (whole blood cultures, minus S9 mix) or to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells treated in vitro. Further, no cytotoxicity was observed in purified human lymphocytes when exposed to thalidomide up to the limit of its solubility in the medium in the presence and absence of liver S9 from Aroclor-induced pregnant rabbit. The CHO assays were conducted without metabolic activation and in the presence of a variety of sources of auxiliary metabolic activation (PB/beta NP-induced rat liver S9 mix, pooled male and female human liver S9 mix, uninduced and Aroclor-induced pregnant rabbit liver S9 mix and foetal rabbit S9 mix). Thalidomide did not induce micronuclei in isolated human lymphocytes (minus S9 mix) and it was non-mutagenic to mouse lymphoma L5178Y TK+/- cells when tested to the limits of its solubility in the culture medium (+/- S9 mix). No indication of recombinogenic or clastogenic activity was observed for thalidomide when tested in Drosophila. In addition, it failed to induce chromosome aberrations in grasshopper neuroblasts when tested in the presence and absence of Aroclor-induced rat liver S9 mix. Some unusual chromosome morphologies were observed in the grasshopper cytogenetic preparations indicating a potential of thalidomide to interact with chromosomal proteins. However, this potential was not evident in the human lymphocyte micronucleus assay, and thalidomide was apparently not reactive to the proteins of the mouse skin, as it gave negative results in a mouse local lymph node assay for skin sensitizing agents. Thalidomide was inactive in bone marrow micronucleus assays conducted using males and females from two strains of mice, and female New Zealand white rabbits. It is concluded that thalidomide is neither a mutagen nor an aneugen. This conclusion is discussed within the context of the results of earlier mutagenicity studies, the recent claim that thalidomide may be a heritable germ cell mutagen to humans, and the current interest in thalidomide for the treatment of immune system-related diseases.",Is Thalidomide mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False

732,"Phenylephrine hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine recommended for use as a nasal decongestant and as a mydriatic in ophthalmic applications. In 1977, total U.S. human exposure was estimated at 1.9 x 107 g per year. Phenylephrine hydrochloride was nominated for toxicology and carcinogenesis studies because of a lack of previous long-term studies and because two other sympathomimetic agents (soterenol hydrochloride and mesuprine hydrochloride) produced mesovarial leiomyomas in Sprague-Dawley rats. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of USP-grade phenylephrine hydrochloride were conducted by administering diets containing the chemical (99% pure) to F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex in studies of 14 days, 12 weeks, and 2 years. In the 14-day studies, no toxic effects were seen in rats or mice fed diets containing up to 2,000 ppm phenylephrine hydrochloride. Doses were increased in the 12-week studies, and deaths of male rats and male mice were observed in groups fed diets containing 10,000 or 20,000 ppm; 1/10 male rats in the 5,000-ppm group died. Other than inflammatory eye lesions (considered secondary to the pharmacologic drying action of the chemical), no specific organ toxicity was noted. Body weights decreased as concentrations of phenylephrine hydrochloride in the diet were increased, and feed consumption was lower in dosed rats. Doses of 0, 620, and 1,250 ppm for rats and 0, 1,250, and 2,500 ppm for mice were selected for the 2-year studies because of the decreased body weight gains in animals given higher doses in the 12-week studies. In the 2-year studies, the approximate amount of phenylephrine hydrochloride consumed per day was 24 mg/kg for low dose rats, 50 mg/kg for high dose rats, 133 mg/kg for low dose mice, and 270 mg/kg for high dose mice. Body weight differences in rats appeared to be dose related, and dosed animals were 3%-15% lighter than controls. Body weights of dosed mice averaged 3%-14% lower than those of controls throughout the 2-year studies. Survival of high dose male rats was greater than that of the controls (control, 30/50; low dose, 33/50; high dose, 42/50); differences in survival were not significant for female rats (42/50; 34/50; 36/50), male mice (35/50; 38/50; 43/50), or female mice (37/50; 34/50; 34/50). Few nonneoplastic lesions were related to phenylephrine hydrochloride dosing in rats or mice. Chronic focal inflammation of the liver was observed at increased incidences in dosed rats (male: 2/50; 13/50; 17/50; female:17/50; 28/50; 35/50). Inflammation of the prostate was seen more frequently in dosed than in control males (10/50; 24/50; 24/50). The incidence of focal cellular change in the liver was increased slightly in high dose male mice (0/50; 2/50; 7/50). In male rats, mononuclear cell leukemia (24/50; 9/50; 5/50) and pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland (14/49; 11/50; 2/50) occurred with negative trends, and the incidences in the high dose group were lower than those in the controls. No increases in neoplasia were seen in dosed male or female rats or mice. Phenylephrine hydrochloride was not mutagenic in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA98) with or without Aroclor 1254-induced liver S9 from male Sprague-Dawley rats or male Syrian hamsters. The results of mutagenicity studies of phenylephrine hydrochloride were equivocal in the mouse lymphoma L5178Y/TK+/- assay in the absence of S9; it was not tested in the presence of S9. Phenylephrine hydrochloride induced sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) but not chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The increase in SCEs was seen only in the absence of metabolic activation with S9. An audit of the experimental data was conducted for the 2-year studies of phenylephrine hydrochloride. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Under the conditions of these 2-year studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity of phenylephrine hydrochloride for male B6C3F1 mice given 1,250 or 2,500 ppm in feed. Survival of high dose male rats was greater than of high dose male rats was greater than that of controls, and the incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia and pheochromocytomas were lower in dosed than in control male rats. Inflammation was observed more frequently in the liver and prostate gland of dosed male rats than in controls.

None of the compounds was mutagenic without norharman. In the presence of norharman, however, nitrobenzene, nitrotoluene, nitroanisole, nitrochlorobenzene and nitrobenzaldehyde exhibited mutagenicity only to S. typhimurium TA98 with S9 mix.

In 2014, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) delivered an opinion on the safety and efficacy of cassia gum in cats and dogs. The Panel concluded, based on positive findings observed in a bacterial reverse mutation test with a semi-refined cassia gum (about 70 mg anthraquinones/kg) but not with purified semi-refined cassia gum that meets the specification as a food additive (< 0.5 mg anthraquinones/kg), that only purified semi-refined cassia gum that meets the specifications of cassia gum as a food additive can be considered safe for cats and dogs, at a maximum content of 1.5% cassia gum (15,000 mg/kg feed) in dry matter, corresponding to 1.32% (13,200 mg/kg feed) in a standardised complete feed with 12% water content. The conclusion was confirmed in an opinion delivered by the Panel in 2017. Following this opinion, the European Commission gave the possibility to the applicant to submit complementary information on the safety for cats and dogs. The semi-refined cassia gum under application was mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation test in  Salmonella  Typhimurium strain TA100. Positive results were also observed after heat sterilisation of the test item. Isopropanol purified semi-refined cassia gum did not show mutagenic effect. Examination of various other cassia gum extracts did not identify any source of mutagenicity. The mutagenicity of the semi-refined cassia gum under application cannot be excluded. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel cannot establish the safety of semi-refined cassia gum for cats and dogs.",Is Isopropanol mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False

In this study, we selected 13 main DBPs found in drinking water to quantitatively analyse their cytotoxicity and genotoxicity using a microplate-based cytotoxicity assay and a developed SOS/umu assay in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. With the developed SOS/umu test, eight DBPs: 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2[5H]-fura3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2-[5H]-furanone (MX), dibromoacetonitrile (DBN), iodoacetic acid (IA), bromochloroacetonitrile (BCN), bromoacetic acid (BA), trichloroacetonitrile (TCN), dibromoacetic acid (DBA) and dichloroacetic acid (DCA) were significantly genotoxic to S. typhimurium. Three DBPs: chloroacetic acid (CA), trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and dichloroacetonitrile (DCN) were weakly genotoxic, whereas the remaining DBPs: chloroacetonitrile (CN) and chloral hydrate (CH) were negative. The rank order in decreasing genotoxicity was as follows: MX > DBN > IA > BCN > BA > TCN > DBA > DCA > CA, TCA, DCN > CN, CH. MX was approximately 370 000 times more genotoxic than DCA. In the microplate-based cytotoxicity assay, cytotoxic potencies of the 13 DBPs were compared and ranked in decreasing order as follows: MX > IA > DBN > BCN > BA > TCN > DCN > CA > DCA > DBA > CN > TCA > CH. MX was approximately 19 200 times more cytotoxic than CH. A statistically significant correlation was found between cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the 13 DBPs in S. typhimurium.

736,"Three short-term assays (SOS chromotest, Ames fluctuation test and newt micronucleus test) were performed to detect the genotoxic activity of organohalides, compounds likely to be found in chlorinated and/or ozonated drinking water: monochloro-, dichloro- and trichloroacetic acids and monobromo-, dibromo- and tribromoacetic acids. With the SOS chromotest, only three of the chemicals studied (dichloroacetic acid, dibromo- and tribromoacetic acids) were found to induce primary DNA damage in Escherichia coli PQ 37. In the Ames fluctuation test, all the compounds except monochloroacetic acid showed mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100. In these two in vitro tests, a good correlation between increasing number of substituents and decreasing mutagenicity was observed. Namely, the toxicity of brominated and chlorinated acetic acids decreased when the number of substituents increased. The newt micronucleus test detected a weak clastogenic effect on the peripheral blood erythrocytes of Pleurodeles waltl larvae for trichloroacetic acid only.",Is dichloroacetic acid mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
737,"A collaborative study of chemically-induced mutagenicity was performed using the four bacterial strains Salmonella typhimurium TA102 and TA2638 and Escherichia coli WP2/pKM101 and WP2 uvrA/pKM101 in order to compare the specific spectrum of response to chemicals among the four strains and to determine the usefulness (sensitivity) of each strain. Twenty laboratories participated in this study. As the first step, 29 compounds were tested for mutagenicity using the plate incorporation method with or without metabolic activation. The compounds consisted of 12 chemicals judged previously positive only in E. coli WP2 uvrA/pKM101, 15 of their derivatives, and the 2 well-known mutagens hydrazine and formaldehyde. The strains and the chemicals were sent from a central source to each laboratory. The tests were performed in two laboratories per chemical. Concerning the result with each strain, the number of chemicals which showed mutagenic activity were 10, 7, 9 and 17 in TA102, TA2638, WP2/pKM101 and WP2 uvrA/pKM101, respectively. Among these 29 compounds tested, no qualitative difference in the response to chemicals among the four strains was observed with 17 compounds, being 12 negative chemicals and 5 positive chemicals. The remaining 12 compounds showed varying results among the four strains. On the comparison of TA102 and WP2 uvrA/pKM101, the same qualitative response to chemicals was observed with 22 compounds. Thus, although compounds tested in this study were selected, partly based on a previously-judged positive response only in E. coli WP2 uvrA/pKM101, 76% of test chemicals showed the same sensitivity in TA102, 7 chemicals (24%) were only positive in the E. coli strains. Of these 7 chemicals, 5 were the acrylic acid ester derivatives and the chloroacetic acid ester derivatives possessing a common structure of a functional group esterized between acid and alcohol with two or more carbon radicals.",Is chloroacetic acid mutagenic for pKM101 or TA102 strain?,True
738,"Among the drugs that induce base-pair substitution mutations in the Salmonella reversion assay are the nitric oxide (NO)-delivery drug, diethylamine NONOate (DeaNO), and the ovarian cancer chemotherapeutic drug, treosulphan (TE). The present study compared the mutation spectra generated by DeaNO and TE in the hisG46 strains, TA1535 and TA100, the hisG428 strain, TA102, and the six Ames II 7000 series strains. Using these strains, it was feasible to conduct rapid analysis of the type and magnitude of induced mutation without resorting to DNA amplification and sequencing. A putative hydrolysis product of TE, 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB), and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) were included in the study to allow for further comparisons between epoxide-induced damage and that induced by the hydroxyl radical. TE (0.93 micromole/pl) induced 16. 8-fold-over-background reversion or a mutagenicity ratio (MR) of 16. 8 in TA1535. The response was weaker in TA100 (MR of 3), and negative in strain TA102. Only two Ames II strains demonstrated sensitivity to TE, and they were TA7004 (CG:AT) and TA7005 (GC:AT). Like TE, DeaNO (33 micromole/pl) was mutagenic in TA1535 (MR of 24.6), TA100 (MR of 5.3), TA7004 (MR of 13.7), and TA7005 (MR of 7.7), and non-mutagenic in TA102. These results showed a preferential sensitivity to reversion of the -CCC-target in TA100 and TA1535, and a lack of sensitivity to reversion of the -TAA-target in TA102. In addition, they elucidated the selectivity of the Ames II strains, with AT targets showing little or no sensitivity to reversion. The TE-epoxide derivative DEB was mutagenic in TA1535 and TA7004, but in contrast to TE, DEB was mutagenic in TA102. Interestingly, TA102 was reverted by DEB and H(2)O(2) but not by TE or DeaNO. This study showed that analysis of mutations is achievable using the battery of strains listed above. The fact that DNA damage can be detected by reversion at specific bases offers a tool for understanding the mechanisms through which drugs may exert their DNA and cellular damage.",Is treosulphan mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 strain?,True
739,"Non-genotoxic carcinogens may play a significant role in development of cancer. Currently short-term assays for mutagenicity classify genotoxic carcinogens and lack the abilities to detect epigenetic carcinogens. The need to develop an endpoint always remains to recognize potentially carcinogenic agents employing rapid and practical bioassays. For this, the present study utilized TA98 and TA1537 tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium to evaluate four non-genotoxic carcinogenic agents (Coumarin, β-Myrcene, Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and trans-anethole). These chemicals were tested individually and in combination with promutagens 2-aminoanthracene (2AA) and benzo(a)pyrene (BP) in presence of metabolic activation system (S9) by plate incorporation method. Exposure to all four test chemicals revealed marked increase of revertant colonies in promutagen combined groups as compared to promutagens alone. However significantly greater fold responses were observed with 2AA combination groups (Coumarin +2AA, β-Myrcene +2AA, Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate +2AA and trans-anethole +2AA) with TA98 strain as compared with TA1537, which seems to have enhanced the mutagenic response of 2AA in metabolically activated conditions. It is concluded that out of both tester strains TA98 strain of Salmonella typhimurium has the potential to detect non-genotoxic carcinogens when combined with potent promutgens either by inhibiting or modulating activities of liver microsomal enzymes biochemically which may indirectly contribute to neoplastic alterations. Further this simple, short-term alternative assay may provide rapid information during extrapolative toxicology for differentiating genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogens.",Is Coumarin mutagenic for TA98 or TA1537 strain?,True
740,"Mutagenicity induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (BHP) or cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) in Salmonella typhimurium TA102 was effectively reduced by flavonols with 3',4'-hydroxyl groups such as fisetin, quercetin, rutin, isoquercitrin, hyperoxide, myricetin, myricitrin, robinetin, and to a lesser extent also by morin and kaempferol (ID50=0.25-1.05 micromol per plate). With the exception of isorhamnetin, rhamnetin, morin, and kaempferol, closely similar results were obtained with both peroxides. Hydrogenation of the double bond between carbons 2 and 3 (dihydroquercetin, dihydrorobinetin) as well as the additional elimination of the carbonyl function at carbon 4 (catechins) resulted in a loss of antimutagenicity with the notable exception of catechin itself. Again, all flavones and flavanones tested were inactive except luteolin, luteolin-7-glucoside, diosmetin, and naringenin. The typical radical scavenger butylated hydroxytoluene also showed strong antimutagenicity against CHP (ID50=5.4 micromol per plate) and BHP (ID50=11.4 micromol per plate). Other lipophilic scavengers such as alpha-tocopherol and N,N'-diphenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine exerted only moderate effects, the hydrophilic scavenger trolox was inactive. The metal chelating agent 1,10-phenanthroline strongly reduced mutagenicities induced by CHP and BHP (ID50=2.75 and 2.5 micromol per plate) at low concentrations but induced mutagenic activities at higher concentrations. The iron chelator deferoxamine mesylate, however, was less effective in both respects. The copper chelator neocuproine effectively inhibited mutagenicity induced by BHP (ID50=39.7 micromol per plate) and CHP (ID50=25.9 micrommol per plate), the iron chelator 2,2'-dipyridyl was less potent (ID50=6.25 mmol per plate against BHP, 0.42 mmol per plate against CHP). In the absence of BHP and CHP, yet not in the presence of these hydroperoxides, quercetin, rutin, catechin, epicatechin, and naringenin induced strong mutagenic activities in S. typhimurium TA102. Radical scavenging activities of flavonoids against peroxyl radicals generated from 2,2'-azo-bis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH) as measured in the haemolysis test, confirmed that in general flavonoids with di- or trihydroxy hydroxyl functions especially in positions 3', 4', 5' are effective radical scavengers. In this test system, however, luteolin was the most potent compound, followed by epicatechin and eriodictyol. Again, isorhamnetin was a potent inhibitor of lysis of red blood cells despite the presence of a 3'-OCH3 function. Radical scavenging activities of flavonoids against the stable radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in principle obeyed the rules outlined above. Flavanones, tamarixetin, and rhamnetin, however, were only weakly active against DPPH, while isorhamnetin was again a potent compound. From these results we conclude that in the Salmonella/reversion assay with strain TA102 antimutagenic activities of flavonoids against the peroxide mutagens CHP and BHP are mainly caused by radical scavenging effects.","Is 1,10-phenanthroline mutagenic for TA102 strain?",False
741,"Two pesticides, the fungicide Endodan (ethylene thiuram monosulphide) and the insecticide-acaricide Kilacar (bis(parachlorophenyl)cyclopropyl methanol), produced or used in the neighbouring countries of Bulgaria and Greece were investigated in a coordinated research programme for their genotoxic effects in a variety of test systems. This included the Ames test, Aspergillus nidulans for mitotic segregation, in vitro human lymphocyte cell cultures for SCE and chromosomal aberrations, in vivo bone marrow cells in hamsters and rats and the dominant lethal test in rats. The genotoxicity of Endodan was found to range from negative to slightly positive in different test systems. At concentrations of 7.5 and 12.0 micrograms/plate together with S9 mix it induced base-pair substitutions in the TA100 strain of Salmonella typhimurium at a rather low level. At a dose of 93 mg/kg b.w. it also caused chromosomal aberrations in acutely treated hamster bone marrow cells. A significant increase of SCE was also found in human lymphocyte cultures at a concentration of 20.0 micrograms/ml. Endodan was found to be negative in A. nidulans for somatic segregation, lymphocyte cultures for chromosomal aberrations and mitotic activity and in rats for dominant lethals and chromosomal aberrations. Kilacar was found to be a weak mutagen in the TA97 strain of S. typhimurium at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 micrograms/plate together with S9 mix. At concentrations of 1.0, 1.5 and 2 micrograms/ml Kilacar increased the number of mitotic segregants in A. nidulans by 160%, 220% and 156% respectively over the control. In Syrian hamster bone marrow cells after acute administration at concentrations of 0, 40, 80 and 160 mg/kg, the MI was 5.50, 4.30, 3.10 and 1.30 respectively, and an increase in chromosomal aberrations of about 300% over the control was observed with a concentration of 80 mg/kg. In human lymphocytes no significant changes were observed in either MI or SCE. In the dominant lethal test after chronic treatment of male rats at doses of 5.1, 10.2 and 102.0 mg/kg b.w. no significant mutagenic effect was found although a decrease was shown in the percentage of females with implants mated with treated males in the first week.",Is Kilacar mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
742,"Mutagenicity of 102 aliphatic and aromatic nitro compounds, industrial materials and related chemicals were tested by pre-incubation method using Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98 strains with and without S9 mix. Escherichia coli WP2uvrA/pKM101 was also used in the mutagenicity assay of aliphatic nitro compounds. Four chemicals out of 8 aliphatic nitro compounds tested were mutagenic to TA100, TA98 and/or WP2 strains. Sixty-one out of 94 nitrobenzene derivatives were mutagenic to TA100 and/or TA98 strains. Thirty-seven chemicals among the 65 mutagens showed higher mutagenic activity than 1,000 rev./mg. The following 15 chemicals showed higher activity than 10,000 rev./mg: tetranitromethane, chloropicrin, 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene, 2,3-dinitrophenol, 2,6-dinitroaniline, 3,5-dinitroaniline, 2-bromo-4,6-dinitroaniline, 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene, p-nitrobenzylchloride, 3,5-dinitrobenzylchloride, p-nitrophenylhydrazine, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, 2,4-dinitrophenylthiocyanate and nitramine. Nitrobenzene was not mutagenic, but mono-substituted nitrobenzenes having-CH2Cl, -COCl, -NO2, -NH-NH2, -COOH, -OCH3, -NH2, -Br, -OH, -NH-NH2HCl, -OP(OC2H5)2S or -CHO group showed mutagenic. Introduction of-Cl, -CH3, -C2H5 or -SO3H group to nitrobenzene did not contribute to mutagenicity. Mutagenicity of dinitrobenzene was enhanced by the introduction of -F, -SCN, -NH2, -Cl, -CH2Cl, -NO2, -NH-NH2 or -COCl group, and suppressed by the introduction of -COOH or -CH3 group. Twenty-three out of 45 chemicals for which ""exposure limits"" are established from the stand point of industrial hygiene in many countries in the world, were mutagenic to TA100, TA98 and/or WP2 strains. Furthermore, 42 out of 57 chemicals for which ""exposure limits"" are not established were also mutagenic. The following three carcinogens, that is, 2-nitropropane, 2,4-dinitrotoluene and 2,6-dinitrotoluene, were all mutagenic, but their mutagenic activity was weak. Many chemicals were found to have a stronger mutagenic activity and a chemical structure similar to carcinogenic dinitrotoluenes.

None of the compounds was mutagenic without norharman. In the presence of norharman, however, nitrobenzene, nitrotoluene, nitroanisole, nitrochlorobenzene and nitrobenzaldehyde exhibited mutagenicity only to S. typhimurium TA98 with S9 mix.

All compounds tested showed greatest mutagenic activities toward strains YG1041 and YG1042, which possess high levels of NR and OAT activities. The relative mutagenic activities of 2,4-DNT and its related compounds toward YG1041 and YG1042 were aminonitrotoluenes<2,4-DNT<2,2'-dimethyl-5, 5'-dinitroazoxybenzene (2,2'-DM-5, 5'-DNAOB)4-hydroxylamino-2-nitrotoluene (4HA2NT)<<4, 4'-dimethyl-3,3'-dinitroazoxybenzene (4,4'-DM-3,3'-DNAOB), and aminonitrotoluenes (2A4AT, 4A2NT)<2,4-DNT<4HA2NT4,4'-dimethyl-3, 3'-dinitroazoxybenzene (4,4'-DM-3,3'-DNAOB)<2HA4NT, respectively.

The mixture and the individual isomers of DNT were found to be mutagenic in the Ames' Salmonella/microsome test, particularly in strains responding to frame-shift mutagens; 3,5-DNT was found to be the most effective isomer in inducing reversion to histidine prototrophy in S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA1538. Similar results were obtained with a quantitative reversion assay using strain TA98; 3,5-DNT was the most mutagenic of the compounds examined, particularly in the absence of post-mitochondrial supernants of rat-liver homogenates. While all isomers and the mixture of DNTs increased the 8-azaguanine-resistant fraction of S. typhimurium TM677 to some degree, the greater mutagenicity of 3,5-DNT compared to other isomers was not evident in the forward mutational assay.","Is 2,6-DNT mutagenic for TA98 strain?",True
746,"Synthetic dyes are released in wastewater from textile manufacturing plants, and many of these dyes are genotoxic. In the present study, the mutagenicity of azo, anthraquinone, and triphenyl methane dyes was investigated before and after successive biodegradation with activated sludge and the ligninolytic fungus, Irpex lacteus. Two biodegradation systems were used to reduce the genotoxicity of dyes that were not efficiently inactivated by activated sludge alone. Mutagenicity was monitored with the Salmonella reversion assay conducted with the base-pair substitution detector strains, TA100 and YG1042, and the frame-shift detector strains, TA98 and YG1041, with and without rat liver S9. All dyes except for Congo Red (CR) were mutagenic with S9 activation. Assays conducted with the dyes indicated that only the azo dye Reactive Orange 16 (RO16) was mutagenic in both TA98 and TA100. Methyl Red and Disperse Blue 3 (DB3) were mutagenic in TA98, YG1041 and YG1042, while Reactive Black 5 was mutagenic in YG1041 and YG1042. Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR), Crystal violet (CV) and Bromophenol Blue (BPB) were mutagenic only in TA98, but the toxicity of the latter two dyes complicated the evaluation of their mutagenicity. CR was not mutagenic in any of the tester strains. Biodegradation studies conducted with RO16 and DB3 indicated that the two-step biodegradation process reduced the mutagenic potential of RO16 and DB3 to a greater extent than activated sludge alone; the mutagenicity of the two dyes was reduced by 95.2% and 77.8%, respectively, by the two-step process.

In this paper, the desmutagenic effect of NAC on a complex mixture, such as diesel extract, has been analyzed. Studies have been carried out in vitro with the Ames test (reverse mutations on TA98, TA100, and TA104 strains) and sister chromatid exchanges assay (SCE) in human lymphocytes. NAC inhibits diesel genotoxicity in both assays. NAC also inhibits the mutagenicity of 1,8-dinitropyrene (1,8-DNP) and 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) known to be present in diesel exhaust and to be activated by cellular O-transacetylases and nitropyrene reductases.

The mutagenic response in S. typhimurium strains (TA1535, TA98, TA100, TA102) and the levels of enzyme activities, responsible for NADP+ or GSSG reduction and for the utilization of NADPH or GSH in rat liver S-9 fractions, were investigated following in vitro preincubation of NAC with four direct-acting mutagens and six procarcinogens. Treatment with this nucleophilic and reducing compound resulted in a dose-related decrease of the direct mutagenicity of epichlorohydrin, hydrogen peroxide and, sharply, of 4-nitroquinolino-N-oxide and sodium dichromate. The mutagenicity of these compounds, both in the absence and in the presence of NAC, was decreased by rat liver S-9 fractions and to some extent by lung S-9 fractions. A diphasic effect was observed in the case of procarcinogens (cyclophosphamide, 2-aminofluorene, cigarette smoke condensate, Trp-P-2, aflatoxin B1 and benzo[a]pyrene), i.e., an enhancement of S-9 requiring mutagenicity at intermediate NAC doses, which could be ascribed to metabolic factors acting in vitro, and a loss of mutagenicity at high NAC doses, which could be ascribed to trapping of electrophilic metabolites.

MTBE did not show any mutagenic potential in the Ames assay (TA98, TA100 strains) with or without rat liver-derived metabolic activation system (S-9). In rat primary hepatocyte UDS assay, a dose-response relationship was observed, which meant that MTBE might damage normal DNA and induce unscheduled DNA synthesis.

But it is the potential for MTBE to enter drinking water supplies that has become an area of public concern. MTBE has been shown to induce liver and kidney tumors in rodents but the biochemical process leading to carcinogenesis is unknown. MTBE was previously shown to be non-mutagenic in the standard Ames plate incorporation test with tester strains that detect frame shift (TA98) and point mutations (TA100) and in a suspension assay using TA104, a strain that detects oxidative damage, suggesting a non-genotoxic mechanism accounts for its carcinogenic potential. These strains are deficient in excision repair due to deletion of the uvrB gene. We hypothesized that the carcinogenic activity of MTBE may be dependent upon a functional excision repair system that attempts to remove alkyl adducts and/or oxidative base damage caused by direct interaction of MTBE with DNA or by its metabolites, formaldehyde and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), established carcinogens that are mutagenic in some Ames strains. To test our hypothesis, the genotoxicity of MTBE-induced DNA alterations was assayed using the standard Ames test with TA102, a strain similar to TA104 in the damage it detects but uvrB + and, therefore, excision repair proficient. The assay was performed (1) with and without Aroclor-induced rat S-9, (2) with and without the addition of formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH), and (3) with human S-9 homogenate. MTBE was weakly mutagenic when tested directly and moderately mutagenic with S-9 activation producing between 80 and 200 TA102 revertants/mg of compound. Mutagenicity was inhibited 25%-30% by FDH. TA102 revertants were also induced by TBA and by MTBE when human S-9 was substituted for rat S-9.

For the microsuspension assay, MTBE was tested at 7 dose levels of 30 to 7400 micrograms/tube in tester strain TA98, TA100, TA104, and TA1535, with and without the addition of metabolic enzymes (S9) at 4 concentration (0, 300, 600, and 1200 micrograms S9/ml final concentration). A closed system was used to minimize loss of MTBE. The response was not significant. However, a high degree of toxicity was observed at the highest doses in all tester strains. MTBE was also tested for clastogenicity i the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test using both male and female Swiss-Webster mice. Mice were administered single intraperitoneal injections of MTBE in olive oil at 5 doses ranging from 0.25 to 1.75 g/kg. There were no significant increases in micronucleus formation at any dose of MTBE when compared with the negative control animals receiving only olive oil. MTBE was not positive when tested for point mutations and clastogenicity, using respectively, a Salmonella microsuspension assay and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test.",Is Methyl tertiary-butyl ether mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
754,"Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is a synthetic compound that is used as a technological solution to problems created by air pollution from vehicle emissions. An important source of MTBE in the environment is leakage from underground storage tanks at gasoline stations or accidents during gasoline transport. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of MTBE leakage for the environment using the Microtox (Vibrio fischeri) toxicity test, Lactuca sativa seed germination test, and Ames bacterial mutagenicity test with Salmonella typhimurium his(-) strains TA98, TA100, YG1041, and YG1042, using both standard plate and preincubation protocols. The result of Microtox expressed as EC(50) was 33 mg (MTBE)/L. The effect of all tested MTBE concentration (0.05, 0.50, and 1.00% v/v) on Lactuca sativa roots elongation was negative and proved its toxicity. The highest tested concentration of MTBE that could be tested in Ames test was 3 mg (MTBE)/plate, because of cytotoxicity. No mutagenic response was observed at this or lower concentrations in any of the four strains used.",Is Methyl tert-butyl ether mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
755,"In Taiwan, betel quid is a natural masticatory, which is composed of fresh green areca fruit, Piper betle and slaked lime paste. Areca fruit contains some alkaloids, of which arecoline is the major one. N-Nitrosoguvacoline (NG), one of the N-nitrosation products of arecoline, is the only one N-nitrosamine found in Taiwanese betel quid chewing saliva. The mutagenic studies in Ames Salmonella microsome test showed that crude alkaloid extracts of areca fruit and arecoline were active in Salmonella typhimurium TA100, and NG was weakly active in TA98 and TA100. The activities in both arecoline and NG decreased further in the presence of rat liver S9 mix. Nitrite was significantly consumed during the N-nitrosation of arecoline and sodium nitrite at acidic condition (pH 3), whereas the formation of NG was favored at neutral condition (pH 7). Crude phenolic extracts of leaf and inflorescence of Piper betle inhibited the formation of NG by blocking the nitrite. However, a high amount of crude phenolic extracts of areca fruit enhanced the formation of NG.",Is NG mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
756,"Several mutants with decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were isolated from the sensitive mutagen tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA100 after treatment with u.v. and selection for resistance to N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG) and its methyl analogue MNNG. Estimation of the GSH concentration and GSH S-transferase activity in extracts of these strains and of TA100 indicates that the GSH- derivatives contain 10-30% of the GSH level found in TA100, and that they exhibit normal GSH S-transferase activity. The mutagenic activities of 7 chemicals, namely, MNNG, ENNG, 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE), 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), styrene-7,8-oxide (STOX), N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) were compared in TA100 and in one representative GSH- strain, denominated NG-57. MNNG, ENNG, DBE and CDNB are potent to extremely potent mutagens in TA100, but induce very low levels of His+ mutants in NG-57. Pretreatment of NG-57 with 1 mM GSH (partially) restores the mutant yields to the levels usually found in TA100. The mutagenic activities of STOX, ENU and MMS are similar in both strains. These results support some previous findings, namely that ENNG, MNNG and DBE, but not ENU are activated to mutagens inside the test bacteria, and also suggest that CDNB is activated by bacterial GSH. The latter finding is in contrast with the current view that CDNB is detoxified by GSH, as is also presently evidenced by a strong reduction of the compound's mutagenicity in the presence of extracts of rat liver, which contains GSH and GSH S-transferase activity. The results with STOX indicate that GSH plays in bacteria a much less important role in the detoxification of xenobiotics than in mammalian tissue, presumably due to a much lower GSH S-transferase activity in the first organism.",Is ENNG mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
757,"Acetaminophen (APAP), aspirin (ASA), phenacetin (PA) and ibuprofen (IB) were tested for mutagenic activity in the Ames Salmonella plate incorporation assay using strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538. These analgesics were tested in four separate tests: without metabolic activation, and in the presence of a rat, hamster or mouse liver post-mitochondrial supernatant (S-9, Aroclor 1254-induced). Treatment of all five strains of Salmonella with APAP, ASA or IB under all four metabolic conditions did not induce any appreciable increases in revertant colony counts, as compared to the negative controls. A dose-related increase in revertant colony counts, reaching levels twice the negative control values, were seen with PA at doses greater than or equal to 500 micrograms per plate. This response was only seen in strain TA100 in the presence of hamster S-9. Therefore, these findings constitute a positive result for PA in the Ames test. APAP, ASA and IB did not show any mutagenic potential under these conditions of testing. These findings are discussed along with previously published results concerning the genotoxicity of these analgesics.",Is Acetaminophen mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False

759,"Benorylate and its two major hydrolysis products, paracetamol and aspirin were examined for mutagenicity in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome screening test. The compounds were tested in 6 strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA100, TA97 and TA98) in the presence and absence of a rat-liver microsome activation system. Benorylate did not show evidence of mutagenic activity in the 6 strains tested with or without metabolic activation at concentrations ranging from 0.006 to 3 mg per plate. Paracetamol and aspirin likewise did not show any evidence of mutagenic activity at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50 mg per plate for the former and 0.01 to 50 mg per plate for the latter.",Is Paracetamol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
760,"The nitrosating agent tetranitromethane (TNM) and the nitrosation product 3-nitro-L-tyrosine (NT) were tested for mutagenic activity in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome assay. TNM showed strong genotoxic activity: it was mutagenic in all tester strains used (TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA102). The maximum mutagenic activity was reached between 16 and 32 micrograms/plate using the standard plate test; higher amounts led to distinct bactericidal effects. The mutagenicity was independent of an in vitro activation system. In the preincubation assay an increased bactericidal effect was observed. In contrast to TNM, NT, the nitrosation product, was non-mutagenic and non-toxic in the standard plate test and with the preincubation method up to 5000 micrograms/plate with and without S9 mix and with all tester strains used. Although TNM is a strong direct-acting mutagen, its nitrosating effect on proteins does lead to nongenotoxic nitro products of tyrosine in proteins.",Is TNM mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
761,"The mutagenicity of prulifloxacin, a new antibacterial agent, was investigated by the reverse mutation test in bacteria, the chromosomal aberration test in cultured cells, and the micronucleus test in mice. In addition, NM394, an active metabolite of prulifloxacin, was examined for mutagenicity in the chromosomal aberration test in cultured cells. The reverse mutation test was performed at dose range of 0.0078-0.25 micrograms/plate using Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA100, TA1535, TA98, and TA1537), and Escherichia coli (WP2uvrA). Prulifloxacin did not increase revertant colonies significantly in any of the test strains with or without metabolic activation system (S9 mix). The chromosomal aberration tests were carried out in cultured Chinese hamster lung cells (CHL/IU). Prulifloxacin increased aberrant cells without S9 mix, and NM394 also induced chromosomal aberrations. In human lymphocytes, no significant increases of the frequencies of cells with chromosomal aberrations were observed at dose range of 5-320 micrograms/ml with or without S9 mix. The micronucleus test was conducted at doses of 625-5000 mg/kg in the bone marrow cells of Slc : ddY male mice. There were no significant increases in the frequencies of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes.",Is Prulifloxacin mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or WP2uvrA or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
762,"Halonitromethanes (HNMs) are a recently identified class of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking water. They include chloronitromethane (CHN), dichloronitromethane (DCNM), trichloronitromethane (TCNM), bromonitromethane (BNM), dibromonitromethane (DBNM), tribromonitromethane (TBNM), bromochloronitromethane (BCNM),dibromochloronitromethane (DBCNM), and bromodichloronitromethane (BDCNM). Previous studies of TCNM, DCNM, CNM, and TBNM found that all four were mutagenic in bacteria, and a recent study showed that all nine induced DNA damage in CHO cells. Here, all nine HNMs were evaluated in the Salmonella plate-incorporation assay +/- S9 using strains TA98, TA100, TA104, TPT100, and the glutathione transferase theta (GSTT1-1)-expressing strain RSJ100. All were mutagenic, most with and without S9. In the absence of S9, six were mutagenic in TA98, six in TA100, and three in TA104; in the presence of S9, these numbers were five, seven, and three, respectively. Thus, the HNMs-induced base substitutions primarily at GC sites as well as frameshifts. Although five HNMs were activated to mutagens in RSJ100 -S9, they produced < or =2-fold increases in revertants and potencies <506 rev/micromol. The rank order of the HNMs by mutagenic potency in TA100 +S9 was (BCNM DBNM) > (TBNM CNM > BNM DCNM BDCNM) > (TCNM = DBCNM). The mean rev/micromol for the three groupings, respectively, were 1423, 498, and 0, which classifies the HNMs as weak mutagens in Salmonella. Reaction of the dihalo and monohalo HNMs with GSH, possibly GSTT1-1, is a possible mechanism for formation of ultimate mutagenic products. Because the HNMs are mutagenic in Salmonella (present study) and potent clastogens in mammalian cells [Environ. Sci. Technol. 38 (2004) 62], their presence in drinking water warrants further research on their potential health effects.",Is CNM mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
763,"Heat treatment of foods containing reducing sugars and amino acids during cooking or sterilization triggers a sequence of non-enzymatic reactions collectively known as the Maillard reaction. 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), one of the major intermediate products in the Maillard reaction, has been found to possess cytotoxic, genotoxic and tumorigenic activities, but the mechanisms of its toxic actions remain unclear. Formation of an electrophilic allylic ester bearing a good leaving group such as sulfate has been proposed as a possible metabolic activation pathway for HMF. In order to further test this possibility, we compared the mutagenic and carcinogenic activities of HMF and its chemically synthesized sulfuric acid ester, 5-sulfooxymethylfurfural (SMF). SMF induced dose-dependent increases in the number of His+ revertants in Salmonella typhimurium TA100. This intrinsic mutagenicity of SMF was significantly inhibited by ascorbic acid added to the assay media. In the presence of chloride ions, the bacterial mutagenicity of the highly polar sulfuric acid ester of HMF may also be mediated by formation of a lipophilic chloromethyl derivative. When topically applied to mouse skin, both sulfooxymethyl and chloromethyl derivatives of HMF exhibited higher skin tumor initiating activity than the parent hydroxymethyl compound. 5-Chloromethylfurfural was found to be a strong hepatocarcinogen in infant male B6C3F1 mice.",Is SMF mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
764,"Soybean acid hydrolyzed extracts are raw-materials widely used for manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics products due to their high content of isoflavone aglycones. In the present study, the main sugar degradation products 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (HMF) and 5-ethoxymethyl-2-furfural (EMF) were quantitatively determined after acid hydrolysis of extracts from different soybean cultivars by a validated liquid chromatography method. The furanic compounds determined in samples cover the range of 0.16-0.21mg/mL and 0.22-0.33mg/mL for HMF and EMF, respectively. Complementarily, due to the scarce literature regarding the EMF toxicology, this study also assessed the EMF mutagenicity by the Salmonella/microsome test and genotoxicity by the comet assay. The results revealed that EMF did not show mutagenicity at the range of 50-5000μg/plate in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA97a, TA100, TA102 and TA1535, but induced DNA damage in HepG2 cells at non-cytotoxic doses of 0.1-1.3mg/mL, mainly by oxidative stress mechanisms. Based on literature of HMF genotoxicity, and considering the EMF genotoxicity results herein shown, purification procedures to remove these impurities from extracts are recommended during healthcare products development to ensure the security of the products.

765,"Dietary casein cooked at 180 degrees C promotes the growth of aberrant crypt foci and colon cancer in rats initiated with azoxymethane. We speculated that promotion was due to a product that could be extracted by a solvent, such as 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF), with tumor- promoting activity or the carcinogenic heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAA). This hypothesis was tested by extracting cooked casein with solvents and water. The extracts were then 1) assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography for HMF and HAA, 2) measured for mutagenicity on a frame-shift-sensitive strain of Salmonella typhimurium, and 3) fed for 100 days to azoxymethane-initiated rats to test the promoting effect on aberrant crypt foci. Data show that 1) no HMF or HAA was detected in cooked casein, 2) no mutagenicity was detected on strain TA98, with or without metabolic activation, and 3) promotion was not associated with the extracts but with the cooked casein residue. Therefore the promotion by cooked casein would not appear to be associated with a product that can be extracted by solvents.",Is HMF mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
766,"The mutagenicity patterns and the metabolic behaviour of 4 structurally related ICR compounds were investigated using the Salmonella/microsome test. ICR 191 and ICR 170 reverted 4 his- strains (TA1537 greater than TA100 greater than TA98 and TA1538), while ICR 191-OH and ICR 170-OH reverted TA1537 only, with a narrow range of mutagenic activity. Although all the products tested were shown to contain a common mutagenic impurity, analysis of chemicals fractionated by h.p.l.c. provided evidence that pure ICR 191-OH and ICR 170-OH also induce frameshift errors. The mutagenic activity of all the 4 ICR compounds, as well as of their common impurity, was decreased in the presence of S-9 mix containing rat liver S-9 fractions, a trend confirmed by h.p.l.c. of ICR/S-9 mixtures. Despite the greater mutagenic potency in the absence of metabolic systems, ICR 191 was deactivated far more efficiently and rapidly than ICR 170 by a variety of mouse (liver greater than lung) and rat (liver greater than testis greater than kidney greater than lung greater than striated muscle greater than spleen) S-9 fractions. Mouse preparations were more effective than the corresponding rat preparations. Aroclor 1254 strongly stimulated tha activity of th NADPH-requiring enzymes responsible for ICR deactivation. H.p.l.c. analyses ruled out interconversion among the 4 ICR compounds in the presence of liver S-9 fractions, while revealing the appearance of new distinct peaks for ICR 191, ICR 170 and ICR 170-OH. The selective metabolic deactivation of ICR compounds may be related to the findings of previous carcinogenicity studies (1-3) which showed the induction of lung adenomas following i.v. but not i.p. administration of ICR 170. Conversely, ICR 191 and ICR 191-OH showed no activity even when administered i.v. Since intercalation of ICR compounds into DNA is the molecular basis for both mutagenic and antitumor activities (4), their distinctive metabolic reactivity may be also responsible for the differential efficacy in pharmacological assays.",Is ICR 170 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1537 strain?,True
767,"Flavonoids such as quercetin and its glucosides, especially isoquercitrin are well known as anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, and anti-carcinogenic, etc. The safety of isoquercitrin formulations needs to be established prior to their use in functional food applications. The mutagenicity and genotoxicity of the IQC-γCD inclusion complex were assessed with three standard assays of the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) and using a combined in-vivo micronucleus and comet assay under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines. In combined rat bone marrow micronucleus and rat liver comet assay performed in male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, the various doses of IQC-γCD inclusion complex (max. 2000 mg/kg bw) and positive controls ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and mitomycin C (MMC), respectively, and negative control (vehicle) were administrated. The results of the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay (strains TA100, TA1535, WP2uvrA, TA98, and TA1537) after exposure to the IQC-γCD inclusion complex with the absence and presence of the metabolic activation system (S9 fraction from rat liver) revealed a weakly positive response but with no biologically relevant mutagenicity at the conditions examined according to recommended regulatory guidelines. The combined micronucleus and comet assay results reveal that the IQC-γCD inclusion complex did not induce in-vivo genotoxic potential or indication of any oxidative DNA damage in rat liver tissues. Altogether, considering the results of the study, it is unlikely that the consumption of IQC-γCD inclusion complex as food or supplement would present any concern for humans regarding the mutagenicity and genotoxicity.",Is isoquercitrin mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or WP2uvrA or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
768,"In spite of its considerable value as a predictor of in vivo genotoxicity and even for carcinogenicity, false positive cases were reported for the Ames test, e.g., with a number of natural food constituents. Here we analyzed the effects of juice of Allium cepa, the common onion, a staple food and traditional remedy used in many civilizations, in the Ames fluctuation assay. We could find mild mutagenicity with an onion juice extract in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100, the latter being less sensitive towards the extract. Mutagenicity was not influenced markedly by the presence of rat liver S9 mix. Onion juice also exerted some toxicity to the bacteria in the same concentration range. Comparative studies with quercetin and rutin, major flavonoid glycosides in onions, revealed a mutagenic potency of quercetin with an EC 50 -value of 4 μM in TA98. The contents of quercetin and rutin in onion juice were determined as 0.71 ± 0.20, and 0.71 ± 0.21 mg/kg. Calculations of quercetin and rutin concentrations in mutagenic dilutions revealed that both compounds are highly unlikely to cause the mutagenic effects of onion juice and that other yet undefined constituents must be responsible for these effects.",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
769,"It has previously been demonstrated by others that acetone extracts of Senecio jacobaea (syn. Jacobaea vulgaris, common or tansy ragwort) test positive in the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test (Ames test). Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are thought to be responsible for these mutagenic effects. However, it was also observed that the major PA present in common ragwort, jacobine, produced a negative response (with and without the addition of rat liver S9) in Salmonella test strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537. To investigate which compounds in the plant extracts were responsible for the positive outcome, the present study investigated the contents and mutagenic effects of methanol and acetone extracts prepared from dried ground S. jacobaea and Senecio inaequidens (narrow-leafed ragwort). Subsequently, a fractionation approach was set up in combination with LC-MS/MS analysis of the fractions. It was shown that the positive Ames test outcomes of S. jacobaea extracts are unlikely to be caused by PAs, but rather by the flavonoid quercetin. This study also demonstrates the importance of identifying compounds responsible for positive test results in bioassays. ",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True

771,"The antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects of Heterotheca inuloides have been reported before, nevertheless its use as a possible chemopreventive agent has not been documented. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mutagenic and antimutagenic activities of H. inuloides extracts using the Ames test. Both, the methanolic and acetonic extracts, were mutagenic in the TA98 but not in TA100 or TA102 strains. On the other hand, the methanolic extract reduced the mutagenicity of norfloxacin, benzo[a]pyrene and 2-aminoanthracene. Quercetin, one of the main components in the methanolic extract, also presented a mutagenic/antimutagenic dual effect and is an inhibitor of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A. The antigenotoxic properties of H. inuloides could be due to the antioxidant properties previously reported and to its CYP inhibitory effect mediated by quercetin. Further studies with in vivo systems will afford information about H. inuloides beneficial and detrimental properties. ",Is H. inuloides extracts mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True

The flavonoids tested were: quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, fisetin, chrysin, galangin, flavone, 3-hydroxyflavone, 5-hydroxyflavone and 7-hydroxyflavone. In these tests, all compounds were shown to be antimutagenic in more than one strain and various mechanisms of action were demonstrated. The results suggested that the number and position of hydroxyl groups may increase or decrease the protective effect, depending on the type and concentration of flavonoids and mutagen used. These studies contribute to clarifying the mechanisms by which these flavonoids act in protecting DNA from damage. This is required before they can be widely used.

773,"The mutagenicity of ten flavonoids was assayed by the Ames test, in <em>Salmonella typhimurium</em> strains TA98, TA100 and TA102, with the aim of establishing hydroxylation pattern-mutagenicity relationship profiles. The compounds assessed were: quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, fisetin, chrysin, galangin, flavone, 3-hydroxyflavone, 5-hydroxyflavone and 7-hydroxyflavone. In the Ames assay, quercetin acted directly and its mutagenicity increased with metabolic activation. In the presence of S9 mix, kaempferol and galangin were mutagenic in the TA98 strain and kaempferol showed signs of mutagenicity in the other strains. The absence of hydroxyl groups, as in flavone, only signs of mutagenicity were shown in strain TA102, after metabolization and, among monohydroxylated flavones (3-hydroxyflavone, 5-hydroxyflavone and 7-hydroxyflavone), the presence of hydroxyl groups only resulted in minor changes. Luteolin and fisetin also showed signs of mutagenicity in strain TA102. Finally, chrysin, which has only two hydroxy groups, at the 5-OH and 7-OH positions, also did not induce mutagenic activity in any of the bacterial strains used, under either activation condition. All the flavonoids were tested at concentrations varying from 2.6 to 30.7 nmol/plate for galangin and 12.1 to 225.0 nmol/plate for other flavonoids. In light of the above, it is necessary to clarify the conditions and the mechanisms that mediate the biological effects of flavonoids before treating them as therapeutical agents, since some compounds can be biotransformed into more genotoxic products; as is the case for galangin, kaempferol and quercetin.",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True

The structures were established through interpretation of their spectroscopic data, the stereochemistry of compounds (1) and (2) were resolved by experimental and computational experiments and their antioxidant activities were measured using the DPPH, ABTS and TEAC assays. The antioxidant results showed that metabolites 1, 4 and 5 had a better antioxidant activity than the reference compound quercetin. In addition, we evaluate the mutagenicity and antimutagenicity of the CH2Cl2 extract as well as of the free radical scavenger compounds 1, 4 and 5 by the AMES Salmonella/microsomal test. No mutagenicity was found in the CH2Cl2 extract using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA102, TA1537 and TA1538, with or without S9 metabolic activation. The pure compounds neither showed mutagenicity in TA 102 strain and the most important result was the strong reduction of mutagenic effect induced by hydrogen peroxide in S. typhimurium TA102, with or without S9, showed by the compounds 1 (more than 93%) and 4 (more than 88%) at 0.02 microg/plate.",Is acuminophenone A mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 or TA1537 strain?,False
775,"Davilla nitida and Davilla elliptica (Dilleniaceae) are plants that occur predominantly in the cerrado region of South America. They are used in popular medicine to treat stomach diseases, diarrhea and swelling, particularly of the lymph nodes and testicles. Chemical investigation of these two plant species led to the identification of the compounds myricetin-3-O-α-l-rhamnoside (myricitrin), quercetin-3-O-α-l-rhamnoside (quercitrin), myricetin, quercetin and gallic acid derivatives in the leaves of D. nitida and D. elliptica. Therefore, it was concluded that the two species of Davilla possess qualitatively similar chemical profiles. In the present study, the mutagenic and genotoxic potential of these plants and of their isolated compounds was tested in the Salmonella typhimurium assay (Ames test) with strains TA100, TA98, TA102 and TA97a, in the micronucleus test with peripheral blood cells of mice treated in vivo, and in plasmid DNA to analyze DNA strand-breaks. In the assessment of mutagenic potential by the Ames test, extracts from both plant species and a D. nitida ethyl-acetate fraction induced positive responses. On the other hand, none of the extracts showed genotoxic activity in the mouse cells.

776,"Euphorbia hirta (E. hirta) is a weed commonly found in tropical countries and has been used traditionally for asthma, bronchitis and conjunctivitis. However, one of the constituents in this plant, quercetin, was previously reported to be mutagenic. This work aimed to determine the level of quercetin in the aqueous and methanol plant extracts and to investigate the mutagenic effects of quercetin and the extracts in the Ames test utilising the mutant Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains. The antimutagenic activity of Euphorbia hirta aqueous and methanol extracts was also studied in Salmonella typhimurium TA98. HPLC analyses showed that quercetin and rutin, a glycosidic form of quercetin, were present in the acid-hydrolysed methanol extract and non-hydrolysed methanol extract respectively. The quercetin concentration was negligible in both non-hydrolysed and acid-hydrolysed aqueous extracts. The total phenolic contents in Euphorbia hirta were determined to be 268 and 93 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram of aqueous and methanol extracts, respectively. Quercetin (25 microg/mL) was found to be strongly mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the absence and presence of S-9 metabolic activation. However, both the aqueous and methanol extracts did not demonstrate any mutagenic properties when tested with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains at concentrations up to 100 microg/mL in the absence and presence of S-9 metabolic activation. In the absence of S-9 metabolic activation, both the extracts were unable to inhibit the mutagenicity of the known mutagen, 2-nitrofluorene, in Salmonella typhimurium TA98. On the other hand, the aqueous extracts at 100 microg/mL and methanol extracts at 10 and 100 microg/mL exhibited strong antimutagenic activity against the mutagenicity of 2-aminoanthracene, a known mutagen, in the presence of S-9 metabolic activating enzymes. The results indicated that these extracts could modulate the xenobiotic metabolising enzymes in the liver at the higher concentrations.",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
777,"Mouriri pusa Gardner and Mouriri elliptica Martius are fruit-bearing plants of the Melastomataceae family, popularly known in Brazil as puçá-preto or jaboticaba-do-cerrado, and they are used in folk medicine for the treatment of gastric ulcers. In this study, we employ the Ames test to assess the mutagenicity of compounds obtained from the leaves of these species. The methanol extract of the M. pusa was mutagenic to the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA97a and TA100, with or without metabolic activation. The methanol extract of M. elliptica induced mutagenic activity in TA98 when metabolized with S9 fraction and TA97a with and without S9, but with lower mutagenicity index (MI) and potencies values than those for M. pusa. Enriched fractions of flavonoids and tannins of M. pusa were also evaluated and they demonstrated positive mutagenicity. The highest values of MI and potency were obtained with the flavonoid fraction, which contains large amounts of quercetin, quercetin glycosides and myricetin. These compounds are probably related to the mutagenicity observed in the Ames test. The dichloromethane extract was not mutagenic in any of the test conditions employed.",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
778,"Byrsonima basiloba A. Juss. species is a native arboreal type from the Brazilian ""cerrado"" (tropical American savanna), and the local population uses it to treat diseases, such as diarrhea and gastric ulcer. It belongs to the Malpighiaceae family, and it is commonly known as ""murici."" Considering the popular use of B. basiloba derivatives and the lack of pharmacological potential studies regarding this vegetal species, the mutagenic and antimutagenic effect of methanol (MeOH) and chloroform extracts were evaluated by the Ames test, using strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA102 of Salmonella typhimurium. No mutagenic activity was observed in any of the extracts. To evaluate the antimutagenic potential, direct and indirect mutagenic agents were used: 4 nitro-o-phenylenediamine, sodium azide, mitomycin C, aflatoxin B(1), benzo[a]pyrene, and hydrogen peroxide. Both the extracts evaluated showed antimutagenic activity, but the highest value of inhibition level (89%) was obtained with the MeOH extract and strain TA100 in the presence of aflatoxin B(1). Phytochemical analysis of the extracts revealed the presence of n-alkanes, lupeol, ursolic and oleanolic acid, (+)-catechin, quercetin-3-O-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside, gallic acid, methyl gallate, amentoflavone, quercetin, quercetin-3-O-(2""-O-galloyl)-beta-D-galactopyranoside, and quercetin-3-O-(2""-O-galloyl)-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside.",Is Byrsonima basiloba A.

779,"Benzidine (Bz), a human bladder carcinogen, was strongly mutagenic to Salmonella TA102 tester strain in the Ames Salmonella microsome/mutagenicity assay in the presence of rat liver S9 mix. Various non-mutagenic plant polyphenols were included in the assay to test their inhibitory effects on the Bz-induced mutations. Coumestrol, ellagic acid (EA), (-)-epicatechin (EC), (-)-epichatechingallate (ECG), gallic acid (GA), (-)-gallocatechin (GC), plumbagin, propyl gallate (PG), taxifolin, and 2,2',4'-trihydroxychalcone were found to have a strong inhibitory effect on Bz-induced mutations. (-)-Epigallo-catechingallate (EGCG), fisetin, (-)-gallocatechingallate (GCG), and piceatannol were moderately inhibitory to the mutations; whereas, (-)-catechin, (-)-catechingallate (CG), and reseveratrol were weakly inhibitory to the mutations. (-)-Epigallocatechin (EGC) and 7,3',4'-trihydroxy isoflavon were not inhibitory to the Bz-induced mutations. Isoliquirtigenin, quercetin dihydrate, and rhein were found to be mutagenic in tester strain TA102. Benzidine mediated lipid peroxidation was conducted employing the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay using linoleic acid as a substrate. In the presence of rat liver S9 mix, Bz could cause lipid peroxidation as an outcome of production of oxygen free radicals. Incorporation of the above mentioned non-mutagenic plant polyphenols significantly inhibited benzidine mediated lipid peroxidation in a time dependent manner. These polyphenols also effectively reduced the iron mediated lipid peroxidation. Thus, it is concluded that the inhibition of oxidative mutagenicity of Bz by plant polyphenols could be due to an inhibitory effect of plant polyphenols on the bioactivating enzymes such as cytochrome P-450 and peroxidase and the chelation of iron present in the cytochrome P-450 in the S9 mix. Thus, these plant polyphenols play a significant inhibitory role on Bz-induced mutagenicity.",Is Benzidine mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True
780,"The antimutagenic properties of the most prevalent flavonoids in rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) were compared in the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay using tester strains TA98 and TA100 with, respectively, 2-acetamido-fluorene (2-AAF) and aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) as mutagens in the presence of metabolic activation. The flavonoids included the dihydrochalcones aspalathin and nothofagin and their flavone analogues, orientin and isoorientin, and vitexin and isovitexin, respectively, as well as luteolin, chrysoeriol, (+)-catechin, quercetin, isoquercitrin, hyperoside and rutin. Flavonoid-mutagen interactions ranged from antimutagenic, comutagenic and promutagenic to mutagenic, while dose-response effects were mutagen-specific and ranged from typical to atypical including biphasic and threshold effects. Aspalathin and nothofagin and their structural flavonoid analogues displayed moderate antimutagenic properties while luteolin and to some extent, chrysoeriol, showed activities comparable to those of the green tea flavonoid (-) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Apart from their mutagenic and promutagenic properties, quercetin and isoquercitrin exhibited concentration-dependent comutagenic and/or antimutagenic effects against 2-AAF- and AFB(1)-induced mutagenesis. Different structural parameters known to affect the antimutagenic properties of flavonoids include their hydrophilic or lipophilic nature due to the extent of hydroxylation and O-methylation, glycosylation on the A and B rings, the C4-keto group and the C2-C3 double bond. The C ring does not appear to be a prerequisite when comparing for the antimutagenic activity of the dihydrochalcones when compared of the dihydrochalcones with the structural flavone analogues.",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
781,"Byrsonima intermedia is a native species of the cerrado formation (tropical American savannah). In Brazil, this plant has been used for the treatment of fever, in ulcers, as a diuretic, as antiasthmatics and in skin infections. Members of the genus Byrsonima (Malpighiaceae) are employed not only in the folk medicine but also as food to make juice, jellies and liquor. The aim of this work was to evaluate the mutagenic effects of Byrsonima intermedia, common name 'murici'. Phytochemical analysis of methanol extract furnished (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, quercetin-3-O-beta-d-galactopyranoside, methyl gallate, gallic acid, quercetin-3-O-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside, amentoflavone, quercetin, quercetin-3-O-(2''-O-galloyl)-beta-galactopyranoside and quercetin-3-O-(2''-O-galloyl)-alpha-arabinopyranoside. Methanol, hydromethanol and chloroform extracts were evaluated in mutagenic assay with Salmonella typhimurium (Ames test) and mice (Micronucleus test). The methanolic extract presented signs of mutagenic activity for the strains TA98 and TA100 in the Ames assay. Mutagenicity was not observed in vivo.",Is Byrsonima mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
782,"The hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) occurs when intrapulmonary dilatation causes hypoxemia in cirrhosis. The free radicals may play a significant contributory role in the progression of HPS, and flavonoid agents could protect against deleterious effects of free radicals. The flavonoid quercetin was evaluated in an experimental model of biliary cirrhosis induced by bile duct ligation (BDL) in rats. Quercetin was administered at 50mg/kg for 14 days to cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic rats. Bone marrow was extracted from animals to analyze micronuclei. Lung, liver and blood were extracted to detect DNA damage using the comet assay. The results showed that the micronuclei and DNA damages to lung and liver were increased in BDL rats. Quercetin caused no damage to the DNA while decreasing the occurrence of micronucleated cells in bone marrow as well as DNA damage to lung and liver in cirrhotic rats. Quercetin showed antimutagenic activity against hydroperoxides as evaluated by the oxidative stress sensitive bacterial strains TA102 Salmonella typhimurium and IC203 Escherichia coli, suggesting protection by free radical scavenging. In Saccharomyces cerevisie yeast strains lacking mitochondrial or cytosolic superoxide dismutase, these results indicate that quercetin protects cells by induction of antioxidant enzymes. The present study is the first report of genotoxic/antigenotoxic effects of quercetin in a model of animal cirrhosis. In this model, quercetin was not able to induce genotoxicity and, conversely, it increased the genomic stability in the cirrhotic rats, suggesting beneficial effects, probably by its antioxidant properties.",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False
783,"Several in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that grape extracts could prevent certain steps in carcinogenesis and a few mechanisms have been proposed for this activity. In this study, the potential antimutagenic activity of methanolic and aqueous extracts from two Greek grape varieties of Vitis vinifera against DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed as a potential novel chemopreventive mechanism, using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA102. The two grape varieties were Assyrtiko (white grapes) and Mandilaria (red grapes), while the oxidant mutagens used were bleomycin (BLM) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Since it has been considered that polyphenols present in grapes are their most potent biologically active compounds, we also tested the effects of polyphenol-rich fractions as well as some of the more common grape polyphenols on the activity of the two test mutagens. These polyphenols were quercetin, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, trans-resveratrol, gallic acid and protocatechuic acid. Almost all extracts showed inhibitory activity against both mutagens. On the other hand, polyphenol-rich fractions as well as individual polyphenols at concentrations found in the extracts either did not diminish or did enhance the activity of the mutagens. These results suggest that the protection of DNA from mutations induced by ROS may be one of the mechanisms accounting for the chemopreventive activity of grape extracts. However, it seems that this protective activity may not be attributed to polyphenols but rather to a synergism of many compounds in the grapes.",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False
784,"The present study has been performed to evaluate the antimutagenic activity of quercetin, ascorbic acid and their combination against an oxidative mutagen. An effort was also made to correlate this activity to the in vitro antioxidant activity of these agents. Antimutagenicity testing was done in Ames Salmonella Assay system using Salmonella typhimurium TA102 against t-butylhydroperoxide as an oxidative mutagen. In vitro antioxidant scavenging activity was tested for DPPH free radical, superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical in their specific test systems. Quercetin (0.5-8 nmole/plate) and ascorbic acid (0.1-100 micromole/plate) showed significant effect. Quercetin (4 and 8 nmole/plate) when combined with ascorbic acid (500 nmole/plate) showed an increase in the antimutagenic activity. In vitro antioxidant activity of quercetin was better than ascorbic acid in all the test systems used. The study indicated that the antimutagenic activity of quercetin was not solely accountable by its antioxidant nature. However, in vitro free radical scavenging activity of quercetin correlated well with the antimutagenic activity.",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False
785,"A methanol extract from the flower heads of Chrysanthemum morifolium showed a suppressive effect on umu gene expression of the SOS response in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 against the mutagen 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (furylfuramide). The methanol extract was re-extracted with hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol, and water. The ethyl acetate fraction showed a suppressive effect. Suppressive compounds in the ethyl acetate fraction were isolated by silica gel column chromatography and identified as the flavonoids acacetin (1), apigenin (2), luteolin (3), and quercetin (4) by EI-MS, IR, and (1)H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Compounds 1-4 suppressed the furylfuramide-induced SOS response in the umu test. Compounds 1-4 suppressed 60.2, 75.7, 90.0, and 66.6% of the SOS-inducing activity at a concentration of 0.70 micromol/ml. The ID50 (50% inhibitory dose) values of 1-4 were 0.62, 0.55, 0.44, and 0.59 micromol/ml. These compounds had the suppressive effects on umu gene expression of the SOS response against other mutagens, 4-nitroquinolin 1-oxide (4NQO) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), which do not require liver-metabolizing enzymes. These compounds also showed the suppression of SOS-inducing activity against the other mutagens aflatoxin B1 (AfB1) and 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), which require liver-metabolizing enzymes, and UV irradiation. In addition to the antimutagenic activities of these compounds against furylfuramide, Trp-P-1 and activated Trp-P-1 were also assayed by the Ames test using S. typhimurium TA100.",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
786,"Mutagenicity induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (BHP) or cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) in Salmonella typhimurium TA102 was effectively reduced by flavonols with 3',4'-hydroxyl groups such as fisetin, quercetin, rutin, isoquercitrin, hyperoxide, myricetin, myricitrin, robinetin, and to a lesser extent also by morin and kaempferol (ID50=0.25-1.05 micromol per plate). With the exception of isorhamnetin, rhamnetin, morin, and kaempferol, closely similar results were obtained with both peroxides. Hydrogenation of the double bond between carbons 2 and 3 (dihydroquercetin, dihydrorobinetin) as well as the additional elimination of the carbonyl function at carbon 4 (catechins) resulted in a loss of antimutagenicity with the notable exception of catechin itself. Again, all flavones and flavanones tested were inactive except luteolin, luteolin-7-glucoside, diosmetin, and naringenin. The typical radical scavenger butylated hydroxytoluene also showed strong antimutagenicity against CHP (ID50=5.4 micromol per plate) and BHP (ID50=11.4 micromol per plate). Other lipophilic scavengers such as alpha-tocopherol and N,N'-diphenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine exerted only moderate effects, the hydrophilic scavenger trolox was inactive. The metal chelating agent 1,10-phenanthroline strongly reduced mutagenicities induced by CHP and BHP (ID50=2.75 and 2.5 micromol per plate) at low concentrations but induced mutagenic activities at higher concentrations. The iron chelator deferoxamine mesylate, however, was less effective in both respects. The copper chelator neocuproine effectively inhibited mutagenicity induced by BHP (ID50=39.7 micromol per plate) and CHP (ID50=25.9 micrommol per plate), the iron chelator 2,2'-dipyridyl was less potent (ID50=6.25 mmol per plate against BHP, 0.42 mmol per plate against CHP). In the absence of BHP and CHP, yet not in the presence of these hydroperoxides, quercetin, rutin, catechin, epicatechin, and naringenin induced strong mutagenic activities in S. typhimurium TA102. Radical scavenging activities of flavonoids against peroxyl radicals generated from 2,2'-azo-bis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH) as measured in the haemolysis test, confirmed that in general flavonoids with di- or trihydroxy hydroxyl functions especially in positions 3', 4', 5' are effective radical scavengers. In this test system, however, luteolin was the most potent compound, followed by epicatechin and eriodictyol. Again, isorhamnetin was a potent inhibitor of lysis of red blood cells despite the presence of a 3'-OCH3 function. Radical scavenging activities of flavonoids against the stable radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in principle obeyed the rules outlined above. Flavanones, tamarixetin, and rhamnetin, however, were only weakly active against DPPH, while isorhamnetin was again a potent compound. From these results we conclude that in the Salmonella/reversion assay with strain TA102 antimutagenic activities of flavonoids against the peroxide mutagens CHP and BHP are mainly caused by radical scavenging effects.",Is cumene hydroperoxide mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True
787,"An assay for the ability of antioxidants to prevent mutations induced by various oxidants in Salmonella typhimurium TA102 cells was developed. Protection against hydrogen-peroxide-induced mutagenicity was observed for quercetin, caffeic acid, ascorbic acid and dimethyl sulfoxide (used as a solvent for water-insoluble antioxidants). No protective effect was observed for green tea extract (weakly pro-oxidative), catechin, rutin, sinigrin, ferulic acid and alpha-tocopherol. Mutagenicity caused by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH) was prevented most effectively by quercetin and ascorbic acid, whereas weaker effects were observed for green tea extract and for rutin, and no effect being observed for the other antioxidants tested. The results for hydrogen peroxide indicate iron chelation to be the most important protective mechanism. Radical scavenging appeared to be effective only with dimethyl sulfoxide and ascorbic acid, which are effective scavengers of hydroxyl radicals and were used here in high concentrations. It is proposed that the hydrogen-peroxide-induced mutations in the Salmonella cells are caused by hydroxyl radicals generated by iron ions closely associated with DNA. Protection against mutagenicity caused by tert-butyl hydroperoxide appears to occur mainly through the scavenging of alkoxyl and possibly of alkyl radicals.",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False
788,"Rhoeo discolor is a legendary plant used for treatment of superficial mycoses in Mexican traditional medicine. Despite its extended use, it is not known whether it has side-effects. An ethanolic crude extract from Rhoeo discolor was prepared, its mutagenic capacity was investigated by the Ames test, and its genotoxic activity in primary liver cell cultures using the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay. This extract was not mutagenic when tested with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98 and TA100, and it did not elicit unscheduled DNA synthesis in hepatocyte cultures. In addition, we explored the antimutagenic and antigenotoxic activities of the extract and its ROS scavenger behaviour. Our results show that Rhoeo extract is antimutagenic for S. typhimurium strain TA102 pretreated with ROS-generating mutagen norfloxacin in the Ames test, and protects liver cell cultures against diethylnitrosamine induction of unscheduled DNA synthesis even at 1.9 ng per dish, which was the lowest dose tested. A free radical scavenging test was used in order to explore the antioxidant capacity of Rhoeo extract, as compared with three commercial well-known antioxidants quercetin, ascorbic acid and tocopherol. Rhoeo extract showed less radical scavenging effect than quercetin, but similar to that of alpha-tocopherol and more than ascorbic acid. It is important to note that this extract was neither mutagenic in S. typhimurium nor genotoxic in liver cell culture, even at concentrations as high as four- and 166-fold of those needed for maximal antimutagenic or chemoprotective activities, respectively.",Is Rhoeo mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
789,"55 commercial phytopharmaceuticals (extracts and tinctures) from 44 plant species were evaluated for mutagenic potential in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity test (Ames assay), utilizing tester strains TA98 and TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium with and without S9 mix from induced rat liver microsomes. Weak activities were detected after exposure of the bacteria to Alchemillae tinctura, Centaurii extractum, Hippocastani extractum and Myrtilli extractum. Moderate effects were observed with Crataegi extractum, Echinaceae angustifoliae extractum, Hyperici tinctura, Rutae tinctura and Trifolii fibrini extractum and tinctura. Quercetin was detected by TLC in all extracts with mutagenic activity except in Echinaceae angustifoliae and Centaurii extractum. From this study and earlier results we suggest that quercetin is possibly the main mutagenic principle in the following phytopharmaceuticals: Alchemillae tinctura, Cratagei extractum, Hippocastani extractum, Hyperici tinctura, Myrtilli extractum, Trifolii fibrini extractum and Trifolii fibrini tinctura.",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
790,"Various studies have shown the mutagenicity of red wine. The major mutagens identified in red wine have been flavonoids, i.e. rutin and its aglycone quercetin. Besides flavonoids, however, it has recently been reported that H2O2 may account for the mutagenicity of red wine in the L-Arabinose resistance test. In the present study we report on the role of flavonoids in the mutagenicity of red wine in the Ames assay. Different wines from Portugal and Spain have been tested after concentration in XAD-2 columns in strains TA98 and TA104 of Salmonella typhimurium concurrently with the determination of the respective content of quercetin by HPLC. A similar approach was used for pilot scale productions of red wines. In all cases quercetin could be demonstrated as the major mutagen in red wines. The levels of quercetin in finished wines and during the wine-making process showed a good fit with the levels of mutagenicity detected. Catalase had no effect whatsoever on the mutagenicity of wines in both TA98 and TA104. These results do not rule out a role for H2O2 in the mutagenicity of wines, detected in other genetic end-points, because H2O2 can be formed from the auto-oxidation of quercetin.",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
791,"The mutagenicity of senna glycosides and extracts of senna folium and senna fructus was investigated in the Salmonella typhimurium reversion assay. Senna glycosides were inactive in all strains, except for a slight, but significant increase in mutant frequency in TA102 in the absence and presence of liver microsomes. Extracts of senna fructus and senna folium demonstrated weak activity in TA97a, TA100 and TA102 in the presence of liver microsomes, and in TA97a and TA102 in the absence of liver microsomes. A strong increase in mutant frequency (3- to 5-fold above background frequency) was observed with all extracts in TA98 in the presence of liver microsomes. This activity increased further following enzymatic hydrolysis with hesperidinase of extracts of senna fructus from one source, and could be correlated to the release of the flavonol aglycones kaempferol and quercetin. The weak or lacking activity of anthraquinone aglycones in the tested strains of Salmonella typhimurium indicates that mutagenicity can not be attributed solely to the anthraquinone content of these plant materials. The chemical nature of other mutagenic components has not been elucidated.",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
792,"Quercetin, rhamnetin, isohamnetin, apigenin and luteolin were isolated from medicinal herbs: Erigeron canadensis L., Anthyllis vulneraria L. and Pyrola chloranta L. The mutagenicity of these naturally occurring flavonoids was tested by the Ames method with S. typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1538, TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102 in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Of the above flavonoids only quercetin and rhamnetin revealed mutagenic activity in the Ames test. Quercetin induced point mutations in strains TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102 of S. typhimurium. The presence of S9 rat liver microsome fraction markedly enhanced the mutagenic activity of quercetin in these strains. Rhamnetin appeared to be a much weaker mutagen in the Ames test. The compound induced mutations in strains TA97, TA98 and TA100 of S. typhimurium but only in the presence of metabolic activation. Comparison of the structure of the studied flavonoids with their mutagenic activity indicates that the mutagenicity of flavonoids is dependent on the presence of hydroxyl groups in the 3' and 4' positions of the B ring, and that the presence of a free hydroxy or methoxy group in the 7 position of the A ring also probably contributes to the appearance of mutagenic activity of flavonoids in the Ames test. It also appeared that the presence of methoxy groups, particularly in the B ring of the flavonoid molecule, markedly decreases the mutagenic activity of the compound.",Is rhamnetin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 strain?,True

794,"The forward mutation assay to L-arabinose resistance (Ara test) in Salmonella typhimurium detected a Spanish red table wine (Rioja) as a direct-acting mutagen. The best mutagenic response was obtained by preincubating strain BA13 with the wine sample in the presence of sodium phosphate buffer and in the absence of any external metabolic activation. In fact, the S9 mixture abolished most of the mutagenic activity of red wine in the Ara test. Such an inactivating capacity seems to be independent of microsomal enzymes and mediated through some kind of heat-stable component(s) in the S9 fraction. Both regular wine (directly from the bottle) and lyophilized wine were strong mutagens in the Ara test, inducing 4914 and 2739 AraR mutants/ml. Both pKM101 and delta uvrB were critical factors in the detection of the mutagenicity of wine, exhibiting a synergic effect in strain BA13. The mutagenicity of red wine was somehow pH-dependent, increasing with the pH value of the preincubation mixture. In comparison with the Ara test, the His reverse mutation assay (Ames test) was much less sensitive to the mutagenicity of lyophilized red wine, TA102 being the most (448 His+/ml) and TA98 the least (38 His+/ml) sensitive strain. TA100, TA104 and TA97 manifested intermediate mutagenicities to red wine. Previous reports have identified strain TA98 as the His strain most sensitive to the apolar fraction (e.g. XAD-2-bound) of red wine. Based on these results we propose that TA98 mainly detects glycosides of mutagenic flavonols present in red wine (quercetin, rutin, etc.), which do not constitute the major direct-acting mutagens detected with the Ara test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 or pKM101 strain?,True
795,"Four commercial ethanolic plant extracts, Tinctura Alchemillae, Extractum Crataegi, Extractum Myrtilli and Tinctura Hyperici, were tested for their mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 with and without S9 mix obtained from rats pretreated with phenobarbital. The extracts studied differed greatly in their mutagenic potencies but exhibited a very similar mutation pattern in which the strongest effect was always seen in tester strain TA98 with S9 mix. Simultaneously we investigated the extracts for the presence of quercetin and kaempferol. Only quercetin was detected in small amounts by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The fractions containing quercetin were separated and collected using a Sephadex LH-20 column. Two different methods were employed to estimate the amount of quercetin in the extracts: a colorimetric assay developed by Christ and Müller, and a complexometric method by Belikov. The quercetin concentrations ranged between 2 mg (Tinctura Alchemilla) and 89 mg (Tinctura Hyperici) per 100 g of extract. We suggest that the mutagenicity of the 4 plant extracts is mainly due to the presence of quercetin for the following reasons: (1) all the plant extracts exhibit a mutation pattern which is very similar to that of quercetin, (2) the mutagenic potential of the extracts correlates well with their quercetin content, considering the fact that plant extracts are very complex mixtures often containing toxic or antimutagenic compounds.",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
796,"Human fecal cultures, induced with either of the flavonols, quercitrin or rutin, were grown in the presence of various concentrations of chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid or cholic acid. Cell-free preparations (fecal preparations) from these cultures were then incubated with rutin or quercitrin. The formation of the aglycone, quercetin, was monitored by the Ames assay using tester strain TA98. The presence of chenodeoxycholic or deoxycholic acids in the quercitrin-induced culture resulted in a fecal preparation which enhanced the mutagenesis of quercitrin approximately two-fold at optimal concentrations of 0.6 mM and 0.8 mM respectively. Higher concentrations of these bile acids decreased the activity of the fecal preparations. Cholic acid gave similar results except a much higher concentration (3.0 mM) was required to achieve this effect. Analogous results with rutin-induced cultures were less clear cut: considerable variation in bile acid effect was noted among volunteers. The authors propose that bile acid in the medium may enhance the ability of rutin- and quercitrin-glycosidase elaborating organisms to successfully compete with other microbial populations. Additionally, the greater variation in results using rutin as inducer may reflect more heterogeneous populations of organisms active against this substrate. The possible role of bile acids and flavonols in bowel cancer is discussed.",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
797,"Mutagenicities of AF-2, MNNG, 4NQO, aflatoxin B1, benzo [a] pyrene and Trp-P-1, with or without metabolic activation, were inactivated by treatment with human saliva to a great extent in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium test strains TA98 and TA100. Mutagenic activities of quercetin, pyrolysates of beef, salmon and sodium glutamate, and condensate of cigarette smoke were also decreased to some extent by saliva treatment, but no significant effect was found on the activity of MMS and pyrolysate of polypeptone. These effects showed individual variations. The inhibition of AF-2 mutagenicity by saliva varied with temperature in TA100 but not in TA98 cultures. Boiled saliva inactivated AF-2 mutagenicity in TA98 to some extent but not in TA100 cultures. Inactivation of AF-2 mutagenicity by saliva treatment was completed within 30 sec. Complex mechanisms may be involved in the inactivation of mutagenicity of carcinogens by saliva, including biochemical reactions with enzymes, vitamins, etc. and/or adsorption with high molecular weight substances in saliva such as proteins, bacterial cells, mucous materials, etc.",Is pyrolysates of beef mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

The mutagenicities of the extracts were assayed by the Ames test, and the mutagens were analysed by GC-MS. The ether extracts of the hydrolysates of infusions of both green tea and black tea were mutagenic of TA98 and TA100 with or without S9 mix. The most common mutagenic flavonols, kaempferol, quercetin and myricetin, were detected in the extract by GC-MS, and their combined mutagenicity represented about 70% of the whole mutagenic activity in the extract.",Is hydrolysates mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
799,"Among the various kinds of spices tested, the aqueous extracts of dill weed from Anethum graveolens L. and dill seeds from A. sowa D.C. (Umbelliferae), exhibited a mutagenicity to Salmonella typhimurium, strains TA98 and TA100. The aqueous methanol extracts were fractionated by the mutation assay using the strain TA98 with S-9 Mix. Isorhamnetin 3-sulfate (persicarin) and quercetin 3-sulfate were characterized as the mutagenic principles. Carcinogenicity was not observed for dill weed and seeds when the diets containing these in 33% were administered for 450 and 410 days, respectively, to the inbred strain ACI rats.",Is dill weed mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
800,"The charred surface of fish and beef showed strong mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium test strains when activated by S-9 mix of rat liver. The pyrolysis products of proteins and amino acids were also highly mutagenic. Among the pyrolysis products of amino acids, those of tryptophan, serine, and glutamic acid were most active. The new gamma-carboline derivatives, 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole, were purified from the pyrolysis products of tryptophan. These new compounds were stronger mutagens than aflatoxin B1 towards S. typhimurium TA98, a frameshift type mutant, and they also transformed cryopreserved Syrian hamster embryo cells in vitro. Tryptophan pyrolysate also contained the beta-carboline derivatives, norharman and harman, which are not mutagenic alone, but act as comutagens. A mixture of norharman or harman and nonmutagenic aniline or o-toluidine was strongly mutagenic. The mutagenicities of charred products of other foods, such as seaweed and garlic, are reviewed in this article. Flavonoids, such as kaempferol and quercetin, and glycosides of these flavonoles were mutagenic. The mutagenicity of cooked vegetables depends partly on these flavonoid derivatives. The already-known existence of benzol[a]pyrene and nitroso compounds in cooked food is also reviewed.","Is 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole mutagenic for TA98 strain?",True
801,"Over 70 naturally occurring and synthetic flavonoids were screened for mutagenicity with 5 tester strains in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome assay: TA1535, TA100, TA1537, TA1538 and TA98. Frameshift mutagenicity was confined to the flavonols (flavon-3-ols) in strain TA98, TA1537 and TA100. The two most mutagenic falvonols, namely, quercetin (3,3',4',5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) and kaempferol (3,4',5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone), exhibiting 12 and 7 revertants/nmol in TA98 respectively, are also the most common flavonols occurring in plants. Other flavonols exhibited less activity (revertants/nmol): galangin (2.0), rhamnetin (0.45), kaempferide (0.24), fisetin (0.14), myricetin (0.12), robinetin (0.06) and morin (0.05). All of these flavonols apparently exhibited significant activation by Aroclor 1254 induced rat-liver microsome preparations (S9). However, subsequent study revealed that only those flavonols either lacking or possessing one B ring hydroxyl group had an absolute requirement for microsomal activation. Alternatively, quercetin with two B-ring OH groups is not activated by microsomal enzymes, but by soluble (S100) enzymes from liver which are apparently constitutive and not subject to the usual chemical induction. 3 flavonol glycosides, namely, quercetrin (quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside), rutin (quercetin-3-O-rutinoside) and robinin (kaempferol-3-O-galactosido-rhamnoside-7-O-rhamnoside), were found to be nonmutagenic. They could, however, be activated by a variety of mixed glycosidases incorporated in the usual pour plate procedure. The most effective enzyme mixtures were obtained from rat cecal bacteria and from the snail Helix pomatia.",Is quercetin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
802,"Benzidine (Bz), a human bladder carcinogen, was strongly mutagenic to Salmonella TA102 tester strain in the Ames Salmonella microsome/mutagenicity assay in the presence of rat liver S9 mix. Various non-mutagenic plant polyphenols were included in the assay to test their inhibitory effects on the Bz-induced mutations. Coumestrol, ellagic acid (EA), (-)-epicatechin (EC), (-)-epichatechingallate (ECG), gallic acid (GA), (-)-gallocatechin (GC), plumbagin, propyl gallate (PG), taxifolin, and 2,2',4'-trihydroxychalcone were found to have a strong inhibitory effect on Bz-induced mutations. (-)-Epigallo-catechingallate (EGCG), fisetin, (-)-gallocatechingallate (GCG), and piceatannol were moderately inhibitory to the mutations; whereas, (-)-catechin, (-)-catechingallate (CG), and reseveratrol were weakly inhibitory to the mutations. (-)-Epigallocatechin (EGC) and 7,3',4'-trihydroxy isoflavon were not inhibitory to the Bz-induced mutations. Isoliquirtigenin, quercetin dihydrate, and rhein were found to be mutagenic in tester strain TA102. Benzidine mediated lipid peroxidation was conducted employing the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay using linoleic acid as a substrate. In the presence of rat liver S9 mix, Bz could cause lipid peroxidation as an outcome of production of oxygen free radicals. Incorporation of the above mentioned non-mutagenic plant polyphenols significantly inhibited benzidine mediated lipid peroxidation in a time dependent manner. These polyphenols also effectively reduced the iron mediated lipid peroxidation. Thus, it is concluded that the inhibition of oxidative mutagenicity of Bz by plant polyphenols could be due to an inhibitory effect of plant polyphenols on the bioactivating enzymes such as cytochrome P-450 and peroxidase and the chelation of iron present in the cytochrome P-450 in the S9 mix. Thus, these plant polyphenols play a significant inhibitory role on Bz-induced mutagenicity.",Is Coumestrol mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False
803,"Ellagic acid (EA) is a phenolic compound that exhibits both antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic activity in a wide range of assays in vitro and in vivo. It occurs naturally in some foods such as strawberries, raspberries, and grapes. In the previous work, we used the Salmonella microsuspension assay to examine the antimutagenicity of EA against the potent mutagen aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) using tester strains TA98 and TA100. Briefly, the microsuspension assay was approximately 10 times more sensitive than the standard Salmonella/microsome (Ames) test in detecting AFB1 mutagenicity, and EA significantly inhibited mutagenicity of all AFB1 doses in both tester strains with the addition of S9. The greatest inhibitory effect of EA on AFB1 mutagenicity occurred when EA and AFB1 were incubated together (with metabolic enzymes). Lower inhibition was apparent when the cells were first incubated with EA followed by a second incubation with AFB1, or when the cells were first incubated with AFB1 followed by a second incubation with EA alone, all with metabolic enzymes. The result of these sequential incubation studies indicates that one mechanism of inhibition could involve the formation of an AFB1-EA chemical complex. In the present study, we further examine the effect of EA on AFB1 mutagenicity, but without the addition of exogenous metabolic enzymes. We report the mutagenicity of AFB1 in the microsuspension assay using TA98 and TA100 without the addition of S9. Neither the concentrations of AFB1 (0.6, 1.2, and 2.4 microg/tube) nor the concentrations of EA (0.3, 1.5, 3, 10, and 20 microg/tube) were toxic to the bacteria. The results indicate that AFB1 is a direct-acting mutagen, and that EA inhibits AFB1 direct-acting mutagenicity.",Is Ellagic acid mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
804,"Ellagic acid (EA) is a phenolic compound with antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic properties. It occurs naturally in some foods such as strawberries, raspberries, grapes, black currants and walnuts. In the present study, we used the Salmonella microsuspension assay to examine the antimutagenicity of EA against the potent mutagen aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) using tester strains TA98 and TA100. Further, we used a two-stage incubation procedure that incorporates washing the bacterial cells free of the incubation mixture after the first incubation to investigate EA and AFB1 interaction. Three different concentrations of AFB1 (2.5, 5 and 10 ng/tube) were tested against five different concentrations of EA for TA98 and TA100. EA significantly inhibited mutagenicity of all doses of AFB1 in both tester strains with the addition of S9. EA alone was not mutagenic at the concentrations tested. The greatest inhibitory effect of EA on AFB1 mutagenicity occurred when EA and AFB1 were incubated together. Lower inhibition was apparent when the cells were first incubated with EA followed by a second incubation with AFB1, and also when the cells were first incubated with AFB1 followed by a second incubation with EA alone. The results of the sequential incubation studies support the hypothesis that one mechanism of inhibition could involve the formation of a chemical complex between EA and AFB1.",Is Ellagic acid mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
805,"The ability of the plant phenol ellagic acid to inhibit the mutagenicity of the food mutagen IQ was evaluated using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the Ames mutagenicity test. Ellagic acid caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the S-9- and microsome-mediated mutagenicity of IQ. The plant phenol did not interact directly with the IQ-derived mutagenic species and did not modify the cytosol-mediated activation of the promutagen. At the concentrations used in the mutagenicity studies, ellagic acid failed to inhibit microsomal mixed-function oxidase activity, including that mediated by the P450I family responsible for the bioactivation of IQ, despite being an essentially planar molecule as indicated by computer-graphic analysis. The inhibitory effect of ellagic acid was independent of its ability to chelate Mg2+. However, pre-incubation of ellagic acid with the bacteria, followed by removal of the plant phenol, did not completely prevent the inhibitory effect of the phenol on the mutagenicity of IQ. Intraperitoneal administration of ellagic acid to rats caused a decrease in total cytochrome P-450 levels and related activities as well as in cytosolic glutathione S-transferase activity. Finally, the possibility that the reported anticarcinogenic action of ellagic acid reflects nothing more than non-selective destruction of hepatic cytochromes P-450, and thus reduced chemical activation, is considered.",Is Ellagic acid mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
806,"Dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) is activated to mutagenic species in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100) by hamster hepatic S9 preparation. This S9 activity is induced by administration of ethanol to the animals. The organic solvents dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (MP) inhibit this mutagenicity, apparently because they inhibit DMN demethylase activity (assayed as formaldehyde production). Ellagic acid, dissolved in DMSO or MP, had no inhibitory effect on DMN mutagenicity, beyond the effect of the solvent vehicle.",Is N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
807,"Ferulic, caffeic, chlorogenic, and ellagic acids, four naturally occurring plant phenols, inhibit the mutagenicity and cytotoxicity of (+/-)-7beta,8alpha-dihydroxy-9alpha, 10alpha-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2), the only known ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of benzo[a]pyrene. The mutagenicity of 0.05 nmol of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2 in strain TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium is inhibited 50% by incubation of the bacteria and the diol epoxide with 150 nmol of ferulic acid, 75 nmol of caffeic acid, 50 nmol of chlorogenic acid or, most strikingly, 1 nmol of ellagic acid in the 0.5-ml incubation mixture. A 3-nmol dose of ellagic acid inhibits mutation induction by 90%. Ellagic acid is also a potent antagonist of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2 in Chinese hamster V79 cells. Mutations to 8-azaguanine resistance induced by 0.2 muM diol epoxide are reduced by 50% when tissue culture media also contains 2 muM ellagic acid. Similar to results obtained with the bacteria, ferulic, caffeic, and chlorogenic acids are approximately two orders of magnitude less active than ellagic acid in the mammalian cell assay. The antimutagenic effects of the plant phenols result from their direct interaction with B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2, because a concentration-dependent increase in the rate of diol epoxide disappearance in cell-free solutions of 1:9 dioxane/water, pH 7.0, is observed with all four phenols. In parallel with the mutagenicity studies, ellagic acid is 80-300 times more effective than the other phenols in accelerating the disappearance of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2. Ellagic acid at 10 muM increases the disappearance of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2 by approximately 20-fold relative to the spontaneous and hydronium ion-catalyzed hydrolysis of the diol epoxide at pH 7.0. Ellagic acid is a highly potent inhibitor of the mutagenic activity of bay-region diol epoxides of benzo[a]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, and dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, but higher concentrations of ellagic acid are needed to inhibit the mutagenic activity of the chemically less reactive bay-region diol epoxides of benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, and benzo[c]phenanthrene. These studies demonstrate that ellagic acid is a potent antagonist of the adverse biological effects of the ultimate carcinogenic metabolites of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and suggest that this naturally occurring plant phenol, normally ingested by humans, may inhibit the carcinogenicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.",Is Ellagic acid mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
808,"In a previous report we described the ability of cyclohexanol to induce CYP activity. In order to characterize this induction we tested the capacity of liver S9 from rats orally treated with cyclohexanol for 5 days, to activate several carcinogenic nitrosamines into mutagens in the Salmonella typhimurium TA100 test system. Additionally, Western blot analysis of hepatic microsomes from the same treated animals were analysed with specific antibodies against P450 protein families 1A1/A2, 2B1/B2 and 2E1. Cyclohexanol-S9 mixture was more efficient in activating the following nitrosamines: N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodipropylamine (NDPA), N-nitrosomethylpropylamine (NMPA), N-nitrosodibutylamine (NDBA), and N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) into bacterial mutagens than S9 from non-treated animals. The mutagenicity of N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) was not modified in the presence of S9 from cyclohexanol-treated animals. Since the main metabolic pathway leading to the production of mutagenic intermediates of NDMA and NPYR is catalysed by isozyme CYP2E1 and that of NDPA, NMPA and NDBA by CYP2B1/B2, mutagenicity experiments predicted that cyclohexanol induces these two P450 isozyme families. Western blot analysis confirmed the results of the mutagenicity assay, showing an increase in the intensity of CYP2E1 and CYP2B1/B2 protein bands in hepatic microsomes from cyclohexanol treated rats in comparison with non-treated controls. Bacterial mutagenicity tests with specific pro-mutagens were good predictors of the P450 induction properties of cyclohexanol.",Is Cyclohexanol mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
809,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ is a potential pharmacological target for disease-modification in Parkinson's disease (PD), mainly acting by modulating the neuroinflammatory response. However, currently available agonists thiazolidinediones (TZDs) present limitations due to safety concerns. We evaluated a novel thiobarbituric-like compound MDG548, which acts as a functional PPARγ agonist displaying higher and selective binding affinity as compared to TZDs. Neuroprotection by MDG548 was tested in vitro and in a mouse MPTP model of PD, and neuroinflammation was investigated as a putative underlying mechanism. Viability assay on rat cortical neurons showed lack of cytotoxic effect in the dose-range of 100 nM-10 μM, which was therefore used for testing in vitro protection against H2O2 and MPP+ neurotoxicity. MDG548 dose-dependently increased cell viability of rat cortical neurons co-treated with H2O2 or pre-exposed to MDG548 prior to H2O2. Moreover, MDG548 induced neuroprotection in MPP+-treated PC12 cells. NF-kB activation was investigated to assess anti-inflammatory activity. MDG548 dose-dependently decreased NF-kB activation induced by LPS (100 ng/100ml) in HEK-Blue-hTLR4 cells. Given the supposed cancer risk of other PPARγ agonists, Ames test for genotoxicity was performed in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98 strains, showing that MDG548 was not genotoxic. In vivo, BL/6J mice were treated with MPTP (20mg/kg i.p. once/day for 4 days) in association with saline or MDG548 (2, 5, 10 mg/kg i.p.). Stereological counting showed that MDG548 prevented the MPTP-induced reduction in TH-positive cells in the substantia nigra compacta (SNc) at all doses tested. Moreover, MDG548 reduced reactive microglia and iNOS induction in the SNc. MDG548, being a non-TZD compound with high PPARγ affinity, void of genotoxicity, and with in vitro as well as in vivo neuroprotective properties, provides a promising alternative in the search for safer PPARγ agonists to be tested as potential disease-modifying drugs in PD.",Is MDG548 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
810,"Non-genotoxic carcinogens may play a significant role in development of cancer. Currently short-term assays for mutagenicity classify genotoxic carcinogens and lack the abilities to detect epigenetic carcinogens. The need to develop an endpoint always remains to recognize potentially carcinogenic agents employing rapid and practical bioassays. For this, the present study utilized TA98 and TA1537 tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium to evaluate four non-genotoxic carcinogenic agents (Coumarin, β-Myrcene, Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and trans-anethole). These chemicals were tested individually and in combination with promutagens 2-aminoanthracene (2AA) and benzo(a)pyrene (BP) in presence of metabolic activation system (S9) by plate incorporation method. Exposure to all four test chemicals revealed marked increase of revertant colonies in promutagen combined groups as compared to promutagens alone. However significantly greater fold responses were observed with 2AA combination groups (Coumarin +2AA, β-Myrcene +2AA, Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate +2AA and trans-anethole +2AA) with TA98 strain as compared with TA1537, which seems to have enhanced the mutagenic response of 2AA in metabolically activated conditions. It is concluded that out of both tester strains TA98 strain of Salmonella typhimurium has the potential to detect non-genotoxic carcinogens when combined with potent promutgens either by inhibiting or modulating activities of liver microsomal enzymes biochemically which may indirectly contribute to neoplastic alterations. Further this simple, short-term alternative assay may provide rapid information during extrapolative toxicology for differentiating genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogens.",Is β-Myrcene mutagenic for TA98 or TA1537 strain?,True
811,"The mutagenic activities of the chlorinated butenoic acids recently identified in chlorinated drinking waters were determined by the Salmonella microsome assay and by the SOS chromotest. The Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA97, TA98 and TA100 were used without and with S9 mix. In the SOS chromotest Escherichia coli PQ37 was used as an indicator organism with and without metabolic activation. In addition, the extremely potent Ames test mutagen (Z)-2-chloro-3-(dichloromethyl)-4-oxobutenoic acid (MX, in the open form), was studied by the micronucleus test with mice using intraperitoneal treatment. The results of the Salmonella assay and the SOS chromotest showed that MX was by far the most potent mutagen of the compounds tested. Mutations were also induced by the reduced form of MX, (Z)-2-chloro-3-(dichloromethyl)-4-hydroxybut-2-enoic acid (red-MX), and by the geometric isomer of MX, (E)-2-chloro-3-(dichloromethyl)-4-oxobutenoic acid (EMX). However, since the solution of EMX contained approximately 5% MX, most of its activity might be attributable to MX. The oxidised form of EMX, (E)-2-chloro-3-(dichloromethyl)-butenedioic acid (ox-EMX), was marginally active in the SOS chromotest only. All these compounds were directly acting mutagens and in the presence of metabolic activation (S9 mix) they did not generate mutagenicity. The oxidised form of MX, (Z)-2-chloro-3-(dichloromethyl)-butenedioic acid (ox-MX), was not mutagenic at the dose levels tested. MX did not induce micronuclei in the bone marrow of mice.",Is (Z)-2-chloro-3-(dichloromethyl)-butenedioic acid mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
812,"Aloe-emodin (AE) and derivatives may be present as undesired components co-extracted during extraction of plants containing anthraquinonic derivatives for preparation of diacetylrhein. AE is a well-known in vitro mutagen, but up to now it failed to induce any clear in vivo genotoxic activity in the chromosome aberration assay in rat bone marrow or the in vivo/in vitro UDS test in liver. However, the two target organs noted during rodent carcinogenicity studies with danthron and emodin, two other well-known anthraquinone derivatives, are the colon and the kidney. Therefore, the choice of the organs for testing the genotoxicity of AE, i.e. bone marrow and liver, may be considered inadequate to demonstrate a possible in vivo genotoxic activity. In this context, the in vivo mouse comet assay was performed on both isolated kidney and colon cells in order to demonstrate a possible organospecific genotoxicity after oral administration of AE. Concurrently, the Ames test and the in vitro micronucleus assay with TK6 human lymphoblastoid cells were performed in their microscale version both with S9 from Aroclor 1254-induced liver or kidney, and without S9. AE induced primary DNA damage in the liver and in the kidney as observed between 3 and 6h after two oral administrations at 500, 1000 and 2000mg/kg bw, underlining an in vivo genotoxic mechanism of action. Furthermore, AE induced a clear genotoxic activity both in the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1537 and TA98 and in the in vitro micronucleus assay in the absence as well as in the presence of metabolic activation. As no significant variation in the genotoxic activity of AE was noted when using either liver or kidney S9-mix, it seems that no quantitatively and/or qualitatively specific renal metabolism occurs. The kidney may be a target organ of AE as it is the major route of excretion. Under such conditions the separation of AE components should take place and the residual content of undesired AE derivatives should be made as low as reasonably achievable. AE present in plant extracts should be considered as an in vivo genotoxin and this property should be taken into account in the risk assessment for human exposure.",Is Aloe-emodin mutagenic for TA98 or TA1537 strain?,True
813,"Benzothiazole and benzothiazole derivatives (BTs) have been detected in various environmental matrices as well as in human beings, but little is currently available regarding their toxicities.

The cytotoxicity of BTs on both bacteria and two human cells was also evaluated. Except for the cytotoxic effect of MBT on MGC-803 and A549, the other tested BTs showed more than 50% cytotoxicity at their highest concentrations in a dose-dependent manner, and their LC50s ranged from 19 (MBT in bacteria) to 270 mg l(-1) (CBT in A549). Activation and inactivation were observed for specific BTs after metabolism. On the other hand, no evidence of genotoxicity was obtained for BT, FBT and MBT, and DNA damage was induced by ABT, OHBT, BrBT and MTBT in MGC-803, by MeBT in A549 and by CBT in both cells.

814,"Chemical inactivation of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and aflatoxin B2 (AFB2) in maize grain by means of 1N aqueous citric acid was confirmed by the AFLATEST immunoaffinity column method, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the Ames test (Salmonella-microsomal screening system). The AFLATEST assay showed that aflatoxins in the maize grain with an initial concentration of 29 ng/g were completely degraded and 96.7% degradation occurred in maize contaminated with 93 ng/g when treated with the aqueous citric acid. Aflatoxin fluorescence strength of acidified samples was much weaker than untreated samples as observed in HPLC chromatograms. On the other hand, the Ames test results indicated that the mutagenic activity of acidified samples was greatly reduced compared with that of untreated samples based on his- --> his+ reversions in the Salmonella TA100 strain. Chemical inactivation appears to be a promising method of removing aflatoxin from food commodities.",Is acidified samples mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
815,"The antimutagenic effect of 10 citrus fruit juices was observed against the mutagenicity of N-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD) in TA97a and sodium azide in TA100 tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium using the Ames test. It was noticed that the juices of all these fruits reduced significantly the NPD and sodium azide induced revertant colonies. The inhibitory activity was enhanced if the mutagen and juice were co-incubated for about 30 min at 37 degrees C prior to performing the mutagenicity assay. Dilution with distilled water led to the reduction in the inhibitory activity. The antimutagenic activity of synthetic ascorbic acid or citric acid or combined ascorbic acid and citric acid was also seen. But the results with fruit juices tempted us to believe that in addition to ascorbic acid and citric acid, the presence of other factor(s) possessing antimutagenic properties cannot be ruled out.",Is citric acid mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
816,"Valepotriates are epoxide-bearing triesters of the monoterpene alcohol 4,7-dimethylcyclopenta-(c)-pyrane isolated from the roots of several Valerianacae species. They are regarded as the main tranquilizing constituents of these drugs. Although the valepotriates valtrate/isovaltrate (VAL) and dihydrovaltrate (DH-VAL) showed a strong alkylating activity against the nucleophilic agent 4-(p-nitrobenzyl)-pyridine (NBP), they were not clearly mutagenic for the strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 of Salmonella typhimurium or for the strains WP2 and WP2 uvrA- of Escherichia coli in the absence of a metabolic activation system (S9-mix). However, the valepotriates were mutagenic for TA100, WP2 and WP2 uvrA- at concentrations up to about 1.0 mumole/plate when S9-mix was added to the test system. With more than 1 mumole/plate the valepotriates were toxic in the presence of a metabolic activation system for all strains tested. The mutagenicity of the valepotriates was inversely related to the protein content of the S9-mix used. The mutagenicity and toxicity of the valepotriates could be inhibited when the S9-mix was preincubated with the esterase inhibitor paraoxon (1 mM) for 5 min before the test compounds and bacteria were added. Therefore, bioactivation of the valepotriates by an enzymatic hydrolysis of their ester groups is considered. This could be proven by activating the valepotriates with purified esterase.",Is Valepotriates mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
817,"We discovered that 2,7-diaminofluorene or 2,7-diaminocarbazole moiety can be employed as a core structure of highly effective NS5A inhibitors that are connected through amide bonds to proline-valine-carbamate motifs. Amide bonds can be easily cleaved via various metabolic pathways upon administration into the body, and metabolites containing 2,7-diaminofluorene and 2,7-diaminocarbazole core structures have been known to be strong mutagens. To avoid the mutagenesis issue of these core structures, we examined various functional groups at the C9 or N9 position of 2,7-diaminofluorene or 2,7-diaminocarbazole, respectively, through the Ames test in TA98 and TA100 mutants of Salmonella typhimurium LT-2. We discovered that, through proper alkyl substitution at the C9 or N9 position, 2,7-diaminofluorene and 2,7-diaminocarbazole moieties can be successfully employed in drug discovery without necessarily causing mutagenicity problems.","Is 2,7-diaminofluorene mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?",True
818,"To investigate the formation of aromatic amine-like mutagenic activity in cooked grain foods, amino acids were heated alone or in binary combinations at either 150 or 210 degrees C. About half of the binary mixtures of arginine heated with other amino acids produced potent mutagenic responses in the Ames/Salmonella assay, but only cysteine produced mutagenic products when heated alone. One-to-one molar ratios of arginine heated with threonine, valine, cystine, cysteine or tryptophan produced reaction products that gave 1200-3200 revertants/mmol in Salmonella strain TA98 with metabolic activation. 1-Methylguanidine, a fragment of arginine, produced a mutagenic response when heated alone or in binary mixtures with all amino acids tested. Analysis of reaction product extracts by solid-phase extraction and HPLC failed to find the known heterocyclic amines commonly found in cooked meats that would explain the measured mutagenic activity. As judged by biological and chemical characterization, several new aromatic amine mutagens are formed by heating some simple amino acids combined with arginine, and these reactants may be the source of the mutagenic products detected in the extracts of some cooked grain-based foods.",Is 1-Methylguanidine mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

With the aim of evaluating the rosemary leaves as drink ingredients, both the essential oil and alcoholic (38%,  v / v ) extract were studied in terms of chemical composition, genotoxicity, antimicrobial, antiviral, and antioxidant properties. GC-MS analysis showed that the main volatile compounds in the essential oil were eucalyptol (40.1%), camphor (12.4%), and α-pinene (12.9%). LC-MS analysis revealed gallocatechin and rosmarinic acid as the main extract ingredients. Both the essential oil and the extract were not genotoxic (Ames test) against TA98 and TA100 at the dilutions of 5% and 90%, respectively; those dilutions were selected as the maximum possible ones in the drink industry. Their activity was investigated against  Escherichia coli ,  Salmonella enterica  serovar Typhimurium,  Staphylococcus aureus ,  Aspergillus niger , and Adenovirus 35. Both were effective against Adenovirus and  A. niger , even the essential oil at 5% ( v / v ). The extract at dilutions of 25-90% had more pronounced activity against tested bacteria than the essential oil at the dilutions of 5-100%; the essential oil at the dilution of 5% inhibited  S. aureus  growth. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay, the 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid decolorization assay, and the ferric reducing antioxidant power assay. Both exhibited good antioxidant activity, but rosemary essential oil was far more effective than the extract. Our results demonstrate that rosemary essential oil and extract are safe and have beneficial biological properties. Therefore, they could serve as health-promoting ingredients in the drink industry.",Is Rosmarinus officinalis mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
820,"Benzimidazole derivatives have a diverse range of biological activities, including antiulcer, antihypertensive, antiviral, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer. Despite these activities, previous studies have revealed that some of the derivatives can induce mutations. This study aimed to screen for potential mutagenic activities of novel benzimidazole derivatives 1-4 using the Ames test and to study their structure-activity relationship (SAR). An Ames test was carried out on two strains of  Salmonella typhimurium  (TA98 and TA100) in the absence and presence of metabolic activation. Genetic analysis was performed prior to the Ames test to determine the genotypes of the bacterial tester strains. Both bacterial strains showed dependency on histidine with the presence of  rfa  mutation,  uvr B deletion, and plasmid pKM101. Further, all derivatives tested showed no mutagenic activity in the absence of metabolic activation in both tester strains. However, in the presence of metabolic activation, compound 1 appeared to induce mutation at 2.5 µg/plate when tested against the TA98 strain. These results suggest that the absence of the -OH group at the  ortho -position over the phenyl ring might be the cause of increased mutagenic activity in compound 1. Additionally, the presence of mutagenic activity in compound 1 when it was metabolically activated indicates that this compound is a promutagen.",Is Benzimidazole derivatives mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or pKM101 strain?,False
821,"Glycomacropeptide (GMP), a whey protein of milk, has functions including differentiation and development of nervous system, and anticancer and antiviral effects. To develop new functions, N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) containing 7% sialic acid was separated from GMP to produce G-7%NANA. N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is another type of sialic acid separated from GMP, which has been linked to immune disorders and chronic inflammation-mediated diseases. Therefore, safety was a concern in the use of G-7%NANA in functional foods. To ensure safety, in this study, three genetic toxicity tests on G-7%NANA were conducted. In the reverse mutation test using  Salmonella typhimurium  TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and  Escherichia coli  WP2uvrA, and in the chromosome aberration test using CHO-K1 cells, no significant differences from negative control were found at all dose levels. Similarly, no dose-related differences were evident compared to negative control in the micronucleus test using ICR mice. There was no evidence of G-7%NANA-related genetic toxicity.",Is G-7%NANA mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or WP2uvrA or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
822,"DON (6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine), a glutamine antagonist, was demonstrated to exhibit analgesic, antibacterial, antiviral and anticancer properties. The study was performed to characterize its in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity potential. DON was tested in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) using Salmonella typhimurium tester strains (TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537) and Escherichia coli tester strain (WP2 uvrA) with and without S9 and also with reductive S9. In addition, DON was tested for the chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with or without S9 to evaluate the clastogenic potential. Furthermore, DON was also evaluated for its in vivo clastogenic activity by detecting micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocyte (PCE) cells in bone marrow collected from the male mice dosed intravenously with 500, 100, 10, 1 and 0.1 mg/kg at 24 and 48-h post-dose. The Ames mutagenicity assay showed no positive mutagenic responses. However, the in vitro chromosome aberration assay demonstrated dose dependent statistically positive increase in structural aberrations at 4 and 20-h exposure without S9 and also at 4-h exposure with S9. The in vivo micronucleus assay also revealed a statistically positive response for micronucleus formation at 500, 100 and 10 mg/kg at 24 and 48-h post-dose. Thus, DON appears to be negative in the Ames test but positive in the in vitro chromosome aberration assay and in the in vivo micronucleus assay. In conclusion, the results indicate DON is a genotoxic compound with a plausible epigenetic mechanism.",Is 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
823,"Pyranocoumarins are compounds with an important pharmacological profile, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cytotoxic, antiviral, antibacterial, and hypoglycemic effects. These molecules have a widespread presence as secondary metabolites in medicinal plants used to treat Diabetes Mellitus (DM). The aim of this work was to evaluate antidiabetic activity in Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and the antioxidant effects of 3',4'-Di-O-acetyl-cis-khellactone (DOAcK), as well as its toxic potential. We obtained DOAcK with an enantiomeric excess of 70% by chemical synthesis. Our results showed that this compound exerts an important antidiabetic effect: blood glucose decreased in groups treated with DOAcK by 60.9% at dose of 15mg/kg (p<0.05) compared with the diabetic control group, and demonstrated a statistically significant increase in weight gain (45.7±9.7 in the group treated with DOAcK vs. -23.0±33.1 in the group with diabetes). In a biochemical profile, DOAcK did not modify lipid metabolism and did not cause damage at the renal level. DOAcK administration increased the activities of Catalase (CAT), Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), and Super Oxide Dismutase (SOD) to levels near those of the healthy group. Histopathological analysis exhibited morphology similar to that of the healthy group and the group treated with DOAcK. DOAcK is not mutagenic by Ames test for Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, or TA102, and is not genotoxic by Micronucleus assay; median lethal dose (LD50) >2000mg/kg and, at this dose, no signs of toxicity or death were reported after 14days of observation. These results indicate that DOAcK can improve glucose metabolism, which may be due to the increased antioxidant activity of CAT, GPx and SOD. In addition, DOAcK is not toxic in the studies tested.","Is 3',4'-Di-O-acetyl-cis-khellactone mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?",False
824,"Tea is consumed worldwide as second largest to water in popularity as a beverage. It has been reported that tea extracts have antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidative, antitumor and antimutagenic activities. The protective effect of green tea has been assumed to be due to the powerful scavenging and antioxidative property of high concentrations of unpolymerised catechins and their gallates. In the present proposal green tea extract (GT), (+)-catechin (C) and (-)-epicatechin (EC) were investigated for their antioxidant activity by different in vitro methods like (i) DPPH assay (ii) superoxide anion scavenging and (iii) hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity. Further these agents were also tested against mutagenesis using the well-standardized Ames microsomal test system. The Ames tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA102, which readily responds to reactive oxygen species, was used and the antimutagenic activity was evaluated against oxidative mutagens tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (ID50-24.41, 29.63 and 113.23 microg for EC, C and GT, respectively) and hydrogen peroxide (ID50-17.3, 18.4 and 88.1 microg for EC, C and GT, respectively). Ascorbic acid was used as a standard antioxidant in all the experiments. Results indicate that all the three agents possess excellent DPPH free radical scavenging activity (IC50-1.5 microg for EC, 3.45 microg for C and 3.8 microg for GT), good hydrogen peroxide (IC50-11.18 microg for EC, 13.5 microg for C and 11.78 microg for GT) and superoxide anion scavenging (IC50-1.64 microg for EC, 1.74 microg for C and 3.52 microg for GT) activities. Further, they also show antimutagenic activity in the above-mentioned test systems establishing their antioxidant nature to be responsible for such activity. The in vitro antioxidant activity correlates well with the antimutagenic action. (-)-Epicatechin is indicated to be a better agent in comparison to the other two agents (ID50-1.2 times more than C and 5 times more than GT in antimutagenicity studies against t-BOOH and hydrogen peroxide induced mutagenesis). Ascorbic acid however showed a much less activity (ID50-12.1 mg against t-BOOH and 7.2 mg with hydrogen peroxide induced mutagenesis).",Is epicatechin mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False

826,"Guanazole and aphidicolin were chosen as candidates in the search for a selective, non-genotoxic inhibitor of DNA replication which could be used instead of hydroxyurea to measure DNA repair synthesis in rat hepatocyte primary cultures by liquid scintillation counting. The genotoxicity of these 3 chemicals was studied using the Salmonella/liver homogenate assay and the autoradiographic UDS test in hepatocytes. Hydroxyurea was positive in both of these assays. Guanazole and aphidicolin did not induce DNA repair in hepatocytes. Aphidicolin was not mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium, whereas guanazole increased the revertant numbers of strain TA102 slightly. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine was measured by liquid scintillation to determine DNA repair induced by 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF), aflatoxin B1, benzo[a]pyrene, cyclophosphamide, H2O2, 6-hydroxydopamine, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), methylnitrosourea (MNU), 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide and UV irradiation in the presence of either 10 mM hydroxyurea, 15 mM guanazole or 0.015 mM aphidicolin. Aphidicolin had an inhibitory effect on DNA repair. Except for the 3 chemicals mentioned below, the sensitivity of the DNA repair measurement was the same, no matter whether hydroxyurea or guanazole was used to inhibit replicative DNA synthesis. In the presence of hydroxyurea, DNA repair synthesis was found at lower concentrations in the case of aflatoxin B1, due to differences in the solvent control values, and in the case of H2O2, possibly due to a synergistic effect between hydroxyurea and H2O2. Guanazole allowed the detection of DNA repair induced by MNNG at lower concentrations, probably because of an antagonistic effect between hydroxyurea and MNNG. Based on these results, it was concluded that guanazole, but not aphidicolin, could be used instead of hydroxyurea to measure DNA repair synthesis by liquid scintillation in rat hepatocyte primary cultures. Although guanazole does not completely fulfill the criteria for an ideal DNA replication inhibitor, it has the advantage of being less genotoxic than hydroxyurea, and also appears to have a smaller potential to falsify the results by interacting with the test compounds.",Is Aphidicolin mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False
827,"To aid in the selection of chemical candidates for in vivo tests, the mutagenicity of 6 oxime compounds was evaluated in the Salmonella plate incorporation assay and mouse lymphoma L5178Y TK +/- assay. All of the oximes were mutagenic in the mouse lymphoma assay in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation. Acetaldehyde oxime was also mutagenic in the presence of S9 activation. In contrast to these results, a positive response was noted only for 2-(hydroxyimino)-N-phenyl-acetamide oxime in strain TA1535 in the absence of activation in the Salmonella/microsome test.",Is Acetaldehyde oxime mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
828,"Sulfur mustard (bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, SM), a chemical warfare agent, is classified as a class I human carcinogen by IARC. No effective antidote against this agent is available. The synthetic aminothiol, amifostine, earlier known as WR-2721, has been extensively used as a chemical radioprotector for normal tissues in cancer radiotherapy and chemotherapy. SM is a radiomimetic agent; this prompted us to evaluate the protective efficacy of amifostine and three of its analogs, DRDE-07 [S-2(2-aminoethylamino) ethyl phenyl sulphide], DRDE-30 [S-2(2-aminoethyl amino) ethyl propyl sulphide] and DRDE-35 [S-2(2-aminoethyl amino) ethyl butyl sulphide], against sulfur mustard-induced mutagenicity in the Ames Salmonella/microsome assay. The antidotes were also evaluated for possible mutagenic activity. DRDE-07 was mutagenic in strain TA104 in the absence of S9; DRDE-30 was mutagenic in strain TA100; amifostine and DRDE-35 did not show mutagenic activity in any of the five tester strains used. SM is mutagenic in strains TA97a and TA102, with or without S9 activation. In the antimutagenicity studies, DRDE-07 and DRDE-35 showed promising antimutagenic activity against SM in the absence of S9, in comparison to amifostine. DRDE-07 and DRDE-35 are promising protective agents against SM-induced mutagenicity. ",Is Sulfur mustard mutagenic for TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
829,"The mutagenicities of 15 naturally occurring anthraquinones were examined in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100 and TA2637 by the preincubation method. 7 of the 15 compounds tested, i.e., chrysazin, emodin, islandicin, alizarin, chrysophanol, 2-hydroxyanthraquinone and emodic acid, were strong mutagens in strain TA2637 with metabolic activation. All of these compounds contain 1-3 hydroxyl groups, and some also have methyl groups. Cynodontin, an anthraquinone with 4 hydroxyl groups and 1 methyl group, was only slightly mutagenic in strain TA2637. 2-Hydroxyanthraquinone, alizarin, emodin, islandicin and chrysazin were also mutagenic in strain TA100 with S9 mix. All the bisanthraquinones tested, i.e., skyrin, (+)rugulosin, (-)luteoskyrin, (-)rubroskyrin and sennoside A, were non-mutagenic in this test system with or without metabolic activation. Unsubstituted anthraquinone and anthrone were also non-mutagenic. These results show that hydroxyl substituents are necessary for the mutagenicity of anthraquinones, the optimal substitutions being 1-3 hydroxyl groups per molecule. The 4th hydroxyl group, in the compound cynodontin reduces the mutagenicity considerably.",Is Cynodontin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
830,The mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of parathion-methyl were examined by bacterial reverse mutation assay and a long-term experiment with wistar rats. The potential mutagenic effect of parathion-methyl in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 bacterial cells was observed without rat liver S9 metabolic activation. Parathion-methyl was further investigated for pathological changes in rat pancreas and liver. The long-term rat experiments showed that parathion-methyl exposure for 3 months can cause pathological changes in rat pancreases acinar cells and pancreatic hepatocytes. Atypical acinar cell focuses (AACF) were determined in the liver and pancreas of the rats. The results from short-term Ames test and long-term rat experiments suggested that parathion-methyl would be potential carcinogenic.,Is Parathion-methyl mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True

Strain TA98 yielded notably lower levels of reversions under the same conditions. The presence of uninduced hamster liver S9 fraction resulted in a weak mutagenic response while Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver S9 fraction resulted in the complete absence of mutagenicity with both strains and with both dyes.",Is Aroclor 1254 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False

The polyphenols in these extracts were quantified both spectrophotometrically and using HPLC-DAD technique, while DPPH assay was used to assess the antioxidant activity. The genoprotective potential was tested on pUC19  Escherichia coli  XL1-blue, and the antigenotoxicity on  Salmonella typhimurium  TA1535/pSK1002 and human lung fibroblasts, while the antitumor activity was assessed on colorectal cancer cells. Rosmarinic acid, quercetin, rutin, and luteolin-7- O -glucoside were among the identified compounds. Methanolic extracts had the best DPPH-scavenging and SOS-inducing activities, while ethanolic extracts exhibited the highest antigenotoxicity. Additionally, all extracts exhibited genoprotective potential on plasmid DNA. The antitumor effect was mediated by modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO) production, and exhibition of genotoxic effects on tumor cells, especially with  O. basilicum  ethanolic extract. Generally, the investigated extracts were able to provide antioxidant protection for the acellular, prokaryotic, and normal human DNA, while also modulating the production of ROS and NO in tumor cells, leading to genotoxicity toward these cells and their decrease in proliferation.",Is O -glucoside mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,False
833,"In order to identify pigmented corn with nutraceutical potential, the secondary metabolite content, the antioxidant capacity and antimutagenic activity of red, and blue corn were analyzed.

The phenolic extracts demonstrated the highest antioxidant capacity evaluated by the ABTS assay displaying values from 2.06 to 7.34 mmol Trolox/100 g DW. None of the extracts was toxic to the tested bacteria strains TA98 and TA100. For TA98 tester strain, percentage inhibition values against AFB 1  mutagenicity from 61 to 93, and 38 to 75 for flavonoid and anthocyanin extracts were obtained. The total phenol and anthocyanin contents correlate with the observed antioxidant capacity. The most biological active corn samples were the blue color while the least actives were the red ones.

834,"Purple rice (Oryza sativa L. var. indica) cv. Kum Doisaket is cultivated in northern Thailand. This study evaluated the mutagenic and antimutagenic properties of hydrophilic and lipophilic components of purple rice using the Ames test. The seed and hull of purple rice were extracted with hexane, methanol, ethanol, and water. The methanol extracts had the highest amounts of phenolic acids and flavonoids, while the hexane extracts contained large amount of tocols and γ-oryzanol. None of the extracts were mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. The hexane extract of rice hull and the methanol extract of rice seed were strongly effective against aflatoxin B1- and 2-amino-3, 4 dimethylimidazo (4, 5-f) quinoline-induced mutagenesis, while aqueous extracts showed weakly antimutagenic properties. All extracts with the exception of aqueous extracts enhanced the number of revertant colonies from benzo (a) pyrene induced-mutagenesis. None of the extracts inhibited mutagenesis induced by the direct mutagens 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-acrylamide and sodium azide. The hull extracts showed more potent antimutagenicity than the seed extracts. Based on a chemical analysis, γ-oryzanol and γ-tocotrienol in the hull and cyanidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside in the seed are candidate antimutagens in purple rice. The antimutagenic mechanisms of purple rice might be related to either modulation of mutagen metabolizing enzymes or direct attack on electrophiles. These findings supported the use of Thai purple rice as a cancer chemopreventive agent. ",Is peonidin-3-glucoside mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False

836,"Mentha is a medicinal and aromatic plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family, which is widely used in food, flavor, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Recently, it has been found that the use of Mentha as a pharmaceutical source is based on its phytochemical constituents that have far been identified as tannins, saponins, phenolic acids and flavonoids. This study was designed to evaluate the mutagenic and antimutagenic activities of apigenin 7-O-glucoside (A7G), a flavonoid isolated from Mentha longifolia (L.) Hudson subspecies longifolia (ML). The possible antimutagenic potential of A7G was examined against mutagens ethyl methanesulfonate and acridine in an eukaryotic cell system Saccharomyces cerevisiae and sodium azide in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 and 9-aminoacridine in S. typhimurium TA1537. According to our findings, any concentrations of the A7G used did not show mutagenic activity but exerted strong antimutagenic activities at tested concentrations. The inhibition rates for the Ames test ranged from 27.2% (S. typhimurium TA1535: 0.4 μM/plate) to 91.1% (S. typhimurium TA1537: 0.2 μM/plate) and for the yeast deletion assay from 4% to 57.7%.

838,"Gentiopicroside (1) is the major secoiridoid glucoside constituent of Cephalaria kotschyi roots. The mutagenicity, DNA-damaging capacities, and clastogenicity of this molecule were evaluated by the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay (Ames test) on tester strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA102, the alkaline comet assay, and the micronucleus assay on CHO cells. All tests were performed with and without the metabolization mixture, S9 mix. In the Ames test, the mutagenicity of 1 was limited to TA102 without S9 mix (2.3 rev microg(-1)). The genotoxicity was more evident without S9 mix (0.78 OTMchi(2) units microg(-1) mL) than with the metabolic mixture (0.16 OTMchi(2) units microg(-1) mL) with the comet assay. Similarly, the clastogenicity without S9 mix was 0.99 MNC microg(-1) mL and 0.38 MNC microg(-1) mL with S9 mix in the micronucleus assay.

839,"Mutagenicity induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (BHP) or cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) in Salmonella typhimurium TA102 was effectively reduced by flavonols with 3',4'-hydroxyl groups such as fisetin, quercetin, rutin, isoquercitrin, hyperoxide, myricetin, myricitrin, robinetin, and to a lesser extent also by morin and kaempferol (ID50=0.25-1.05 micromol per plate). With the exception of isorhamnetin, rhamnetin, morin, and kaempferol, closely similar results were obtained with both peroxides. Hydrogenation of the double bond between carbons 2 and 3 (dihydroquercetin, dihydrorobinetin) as well as the additional elimination of the carbonyl function at carbon 4 (catechins) resulted in a loss of antimutagenicity with the notable exception of catechin itself. Again, all flavones and flavanones tested were inactive except luteolin, luteolin-7-glucoside, diosmetin, and naringenin. The typical radical scavenger butylated hydroxytoluene also showed strong antimutagenicity against CHP (ID50=5.4 micromol per plate) and BHP (ID50=11.4 micromol per plate). Other lipophilic scavengers such as alpha-tocopherol and N,N'-diphenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine exerted only moderate effects, the hydrophilic scavenger trolox was inactive. The metal chelating agent 1,10-phenanthroline strongly reduced mutagenicities induced by CHP and BHP (ID50=2.75 and 2.5 micromol per plate) at low concentrations but induced mutagenic activities at higher concentrations. The iron chelator deferoxamine mesylate, however, was less effective in both respects. The copper chelator neocuproine effectively inhibited mutagenicity induced by BHP (ID50=39.7 micromol per plate) and CHP (ID50=25.9 micrommol per plate), the iron chelator 2,2'-dipyridyl was less potent (ID50=6.25 mmol per plate against BHP, 0.42 mmol per plate against CHP). In the absence of BHP and CHP, yet not in the presence of these hydroperoxides, quercetin, rutin, catechin, epicatechin, and naringenin induced strong mutagenic activities in S. typhimurium TA102. Radical scavenging activities of flavonoids against peroxyl radicals generated from 2,2'-azo-bis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH) as measured in the haemolysis test, confirmed that in general flavonoids with di- or trihydroxy hydroxyl functions especially in positions 3', 4', 5' are effective radical scavengers. In this test system, however, luteolin was the most potent compound, followed by epicatechin and eriodictyol. Again, isorhamnetin was a potent inhibitor of lysis of red blood cells despite the presence of a 3'-OCH3 function. Radical scavenging activities of flavonoids against the stable radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in principle obeyed the rules outlined above. Flavanones, tamarixetin, and rhamnetin, however, were only weakly active against DPPH, while isorhamnetin was again a potent compound. From these results we conclude that in the Salmonella/reversion assay with strain TA102 antimutagenic activities of flavonoids against the peroxide mutagens CHP and BHP are mainly caused by radical scavenging effects.",Is luteolin-7-glucoside mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False

In the mixed applications of AFB1 (1 microgram/plate) with the flavonoids (300 micrograms/plate) in the presence of a mammalian metabolic activation system (S9 mix), chrysin, apigenin, luteolin and its glucoside, kaempferol, fisetin, morin, naringenin, hesperetin, persicogenin, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin showed the antimutagenic effect against AFB1 with more than 70% inhibition rate. A little or no antimutagenicities except flavone against MNNG (0.5 microgram/plate) were observed. For the antimutagenicity of the flavonoids on AFB1, the flavonoid structure that contains the free 5-, 7-hydroxyl group seemed to be essential. However, saturation of the 2,3-double bond or elimination of the 4-keto group did not affect the activity.",Is glucoside mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
841,"Nitropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are ubiquitous environmental pollutants, many of which are potent mutagens in bacterial and mammalian cells and carcinogenic to rodents. In this study, we investigated the fungal metabolism of 1-nitropyrene and determined the mutagenic activity of the metabolites toward Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA98NR, and TA100. Cunninghamella elegans metabolized 1-nitropyrene to form glucoside conjugates of 6-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene and 8-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene. The metabolites were isolated by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and characterized by application of UV absorption, 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectroscopy. Mutagenicity assays performed on samples extracted from incubations of C. elegans with 1-nitropyrene indicated that mutagenic activity decreased with time. Consistent with the loss in mutagenic activity, the glucoside conjugates of 6- and 8-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene were nonmutagenic in the Salmonella reversion assay. The results indicate that the fungus C. elegans metabolizes 1-nitropyrene to detoxified products.",Is glucoside conjugates of 6-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
842,"The additive cassia gum consists mainly of high-molecular weight polysaccharides composed primarily of a linear chain of 1,4-β-d-mannopyranose units with 1,6-linked α-d-galactopyranose units. In 2014, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) delivered an opinion on the safety and efficacy of cassia gum in cats and dogs. The Panel concluded, based on positive findings observed in a bacterial reverse mutation test with a semi-refined cassia gum (about 70 mg anthraquinones/kg) but not with purified semi-refined cassia gum that meets the specification as a food additive (< 0.5 mg anthraquinones/kg), that only purified semi-refined cassia gum that meets the specifications of cassia gum as a food additive can be considered safe for cats and dogs, at a maximum content of 1.5% cassia gum (15,000 mg/kg feed) in dry matter, corresponding to 1.32% (13,200 mg/kg feed) in a standardised complete feed with 12% water content. The conclusion was confirmed in an opinion delivered by the Panel in 2017. Following this opinion, the European Commission gave the possibility to the applicant to submit complementary information on the safety for cats and dogs. The semi-refined cassia gum under application was mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation test in  Salmonella  Typhimurium strain TA100. Positive results were also observed after heat sterilisation of the test item. Isopropanol purified semi-refined cassia gum did not show mutagenic effect. Examination of various other cassia gum extracts did not identify any source of mutagenicity. The mutagenicity of the semi-refined cassia gum under application cannot be excluded. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel cannot establish the safety of semi-refined cassia gum for cats and dogs.",Is semi-refined cassia gum mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
843,"The antimutagenicity of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) prepared by refluxing D-glucose and L-tryptophan under various reaction conditions was determined by means of the Ames test. The dose of MRPs with 5 mg per plate showed no toxicity, and mutagenicity to Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 was used for antimutagenic assay. The mutagenicity of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo (4,5-f) quinoline (IQ) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido (1,2-a:3',2'-d) imidazole (Glu-P-1) toward TA98 was markedly reduced by the addition of glucose-tryptophan MRPs, whereas the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (NQNO) was not inhibited. The mutagenicity of IQ, Glu-P-1, and NQNO toward TA100 was also markedly reduced by glucose-tryptophan MRPs, but the mutagenicity of NQNO was only slightly inhibited. Greater antimutagenic effects of glucose-tryptophan MRPs were found when these materials were prepared at an alkaline pH. The optimum combinations of reaction conditions for obtaining antimutagenic MRPs to IQ were glucose-tryptophan molar ratio = 0.5:0.25 at pH 9.0 for 5 and 10 h, molar ratio = 0.5:0.5 at pH 11.0 for 10 h, and molar ratio = 1.0:0.25 at pH 7.0 for 15 h and at pH 11.0 for 15 h. The antimutagenic effect of glucose-tryptophan MRPs to IQ and Glu-P-1 was well correlated with their browning intensity, reducing power, and antioxidative activity. The antimutagenicity of glucose-tryptophan MRPs might be due to both desmutagenic and bio-antimutagenic effects.",Is glucose-tryptophan mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
844,"Strain TA102 of S. typhimurium is a new histidine-requiring mutant, particularly suited to the detection of oxidative mutagens acting at A.T base pairs. 10 oxidizing chemicals, previously tested in strain TA102, were used to evaluate the mutagenic sensitivity of the L-arabinose forward mutation assay of S. typhimurium with respect to those types of mutagens. The mutagenicity of each compound was determined by liquid test, measuring both the frequency of mutants among the survivors and the absolute number of mutants growing in selective plates with traces of D-glucose. Strain BA13 with a wild-type lipopolysaccharide barrier was used as compared to the deep rough derivative strain BA9. The chemicals studied were: bleomycin, t-butyl hydroperoxide, chromium trioxide, cumene hydroperoxide, formaldehyde, glyoxal, glutaraldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, paraquat, and phenylhydrazine. Additionally, ultrasonic oscillation was used as a presumable non-mutagenic lethal control treatment. The L-arabinose forward mutation assay detected the mutagenic activity of all the chemicals under study with a high degree of sensitivity, including paraquat which is unable to revert strain TA102. Positive responses were obtained at doses equivalent to or 10 times lower than the doses detected by strain TA102. The results support the idea that the L-arabinose forward mutation assay could replace the set of specific tester strains used by the histidine reverse mutation assay in general screening for genetic toxins.",Is glyoxal mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True
845,"Byrsonima basiloba A. Juss. species is a native arboreal type from the Brazilian ""cerrado"" (tropical American savanna), and the local population uses it to treat diseases, such as diarrhea and gastric ulcer. It belongs to the Malpighiaceae family, and it is commonly known as ""murici."" Considering the popular use of B. basiloba derivatives and the lack of pharmacological potential studies regarding this vegetal species, the mutagenic and antimutagenic effect of methanol (MeOH) and chloroform extracts were evaluated by the Ames test, using strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA102 of Salmonella typhimurium. No mutagenic activity was observed in any of the extracts. To evaluate the antimutagenic potential, direct and indirect mutagenic agents were used: 4 nitro-o-phenylenediamine, sodium azide, mitomycin C, aflatoxin B(1), benzo[a]pyrene, and hydrogen peroxide. Both the extracts evaluated showed antimutagenic activity, but the highest value of inhibition level (89%) was obtained with the MeOH extract and strain TA100 in the presence of aflatoxin B(1). Phytochemical analysis of the extracts revealed the presence of n-alkanes, lupeol, ursolic and oleanolic acid, (+)-catechin, quercetin-3-O-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside, gallic acid, methyl gallate, amentoflavone, quercetin, quercetin-3-O-(2""-O-galloyl)-beta-D-galactopyranoside, and quercetin-3-O-(2""-O-galloyl)-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
846,"In most towns of India, wastewater coming from both industrial and domestic sources and without any treatment is used to irrigate the agricultural crops. This practice has been polluting the soil, and pollutants could possibly reach the food chain. For the above reasons, the wastewaters of Ghaziabad City (India), which is used for irrigation, were sampled (at two different sites) and monitored for the presence of genotoxic agents from January 2005 to June 2007. Gas chromatographic analysis showed the presence of certain OC (DDE, DDT, Dieldrin, Aldrin, and Endosulfan) and OP (Dimethoate, Malathion, Methlyparathion, and Chlorpyrifos) pesticides in both the sampling sites. Wastewater samples were concentrated using XAD resins (XAD-4 and XAD-8) and liquid-liquid extraction procedures, and the extracts were assayed for genotoxic potential by Ames Salmonella/microsome test, DNA repair defective mutants, and bacteriophage lambda systems. The test samples exhibited significant mutagenicity with TA98, TA97a, and TA100 strains with the probable role of contaminating pesticides in the wastewater. However, XAD-concentrated samples were more mutagenic in both sites as compared to liquid-liquid-extracted samples. The damage in the DNA repair defective mutants in the presence of XAD-concentrated water samples were also found to be higher to that of liquid-liquid-extracted water samples at the dose level of 20 muL/mL culture. All the mutants invariably exhibited significant decline in their colony-forming units as compared to their isogenic wild-type counterparts. The survival was decreased by 81.7 and 75.5% in polA(-) strain in site I, and 76.0 and 73.5% in site II in polA(-) under the same experimental conditions after 6 h of treatment with XAD-concentrated and liquid-liquid-extracted samples, respectively.

HMPA, in common with the other formaldehyde-releasing agents studied, is non-mutagenic to Salmonella. The present paper describes the mutagenicity of HEMLA to strain TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium. Activity is dependent upon both the use of a pre-incubation assay protocol and on high concentrations of Aroclor-induced rat liver in the S9 mix. HMPA was inactive under similar conditions of test.",Is HMPA mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
848,"Elevated levels of oxidative DNA lesions have been noted in many tumors and such damage is strongly implicated in the etiology of cancer. The cumulative risk of cancer increases with the fourth power of age and is associated with an accumulation of oxidative DNA damage. Many agents, synthetic or natural, that can inhibit mutation have been depicted as cancer chemopreventive agents. Antimutagenicity of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylgutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors atorvastatin and lovastatin was studied using the Ames Salmonella typhimurium assay. Directly acting mutagens, sodium azide (NaN(3)) and 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPDA), were used to induce mutation in Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100. The antimutagenicity of lovastatin and atorvastatin was found to be significant (p < 0.01) and dose-dependent. The percentage inhibition of a 3 mg lovastatin-treated plate was found to be 79.9% and 61.8% against NPDA- and NaN(3)-induced mutation to TA98 and TA100, respectively. Atorvastatin (0.5 mg/plate) inhibited NPDA-and NaN(3)-induced mutation to TA98 and TA100 by 78.6% and 45.5%, respectively. Atorvastatin showed antimutagenic activity at lower concentrations than lovatstatin.

849,"While HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin demonstrate lack of in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity and clastogenicity in bacterial and mammalian cells, long term rodent carcinogenicity studies resulted in an increased incidence in neoplasms at high doses. These effects may be attributable to an exaggeration of the desired biochemical effect of the drug and/or a tumor promoting effect. The genotoxicity of atorvastatin, a newly developed HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, was evaluated in a variety of test systems. In bacterial mutagenicity tests, the E. coli tester strain WP2(uvrA) and S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA1538 were exposed to concentrations of atorvastatin as high as 5000 micrograms/plate both in the absence (S9-) and presence (S9+) of metabolic activation. Atorvastatin was not mutagenic in either E. coli or S. typhimurium. Chinese hamster lung V79 cell cultures were exposed to atorvastatin at concentrations of 50-300 micrograms/ml (S9-) and 100-300 micrograms/ml (S9+) and structural chromosome aberrations were assessed. Mutation at the hgprt locus was assessed at concentrations of 100-300 micrograms/ml (S9-) and 150-275 micrograms/ml (S9+). Atorvastatin was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in the absence or presence of S9. The lack of in vitro genotoxicity was corroborated in vivo in a mouse micronucleus study in which single oral doses of atorvastatin were administered to male and female CD-1 mice at 1, 2500, or 5000 mg/kg. No biologically significant increases in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in bone marrow at 24, 48, or 72 h postdosing were observed. Thus, atorvastatin, as with the other tested HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, is not genotoxic.",Is Atorvastatin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
850,"Allyl acetate, allyl alcohol, and acrolein are used in the manufacture of detergents, plastics, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals and as agricultural agents and food additives. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F(1) mice received allyl acetate, allyl alcohol, or acrolein by gavage for 14 weeks. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Drosophila melanogaster, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, rat bone marrow erythrocytes, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were administered 0, 6, 12, 25, 50, or 100 mg allyl acetate/kg body weight, 0, 1.5, 3, 6, 12, or 25 mg/kg allyl alcohol, or 0, 0.75, 1.25, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg acrolein in 0.5% methylcellulose by gavage, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were administered 0, 8, 16, 32, 62.5, or 125 mg/kg allyl acetate, 0, 3, 6, 12, 25, or 50 mg/kg allyl alcohol, or 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg acrolein in 0.5% methylcellulose by gavage, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. In the allyl acetate rat study, all males and females in the 100 mg/kg groups died or were killed moribund by day 8; there were no other deaths. In the allyl alcohol study, all rats survived to the end of the study except one 6 mg/kg female. In the acrolein rat study, eight males and eight females in the 10 mg/kg groups died by week 9 of the study. Two males in the 2.5 and 5 mg/kg groups and one or two females in the 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg groups also died early; two of these deaths were gavage accidents. In the allyl acetate mouse study, all males and females in the 125 mg/kg group died during the first week of the study. All other early deaths, except five 62.5 mg/kg males and one 32 mg/kg female, were gavage accidents. In the allyl alcohol mouse study, one 50 mg/kg female died due to a gavage accident; all other animals survived to the end of the study. In the acrolein mouse study, all males and females administered 20 mg/kg died during the first week of the study. All other early deaths, except one male and one female administered 10 mg/kg, were unrelated to chemical administration. The concentration of 3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid (3-HPM) in the urine of rats and mice was determined after the first dose of chemical and at the end of the 14-week study. At both time points, the concentrations of 3-HPM in the urine of animals that received allyl acetate or allyl alcohol increased linearly with dose. In animals dosed with acrolein, the concentrations of 3-HPM exhibited a nonlinear increase with dose at the first time point. At the end of the study, the concentration of 3-HPM in the urine of animals dosed with acrolein was linear with dose except at the highest concentration administered. Since urine volumes were not recorded during the urine collection, complete quantitation of these data was not possible. The final mean body weights and mean body weight gains of male rats administered 12 or 50 mg/kg allyl acetate and of male and female rats administered 10 mg/kg acrolein were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls. The mean body weight gain of male mice in the 50 mg/kg group in the allyl alcohol study was also less than that of the vehicle controls. Final mean body weights and mean body weight gains of dosed female rats and male and female mice in the allyl acetate studies, male and female rats and female mice in the allyl alcohol studies, and male and female mice in the acrolein studies were generally similar to those of the respective vehicle controls. Clinical findings related to allyl acetate administration included pallor, eye or nasal discharge, ruffled fur, lethargy, diarrhea, and thinness among rats in the 100 mg/kg groups and lethargy, abnormal breathing, thinness, and ruffled fur among mice that died early. In the acrolein study, clinical findings included abnormal breathing, eye or nasal discharge, ruffled fur, thinness, and lethargy in rats in the 10 mg/kg groups. The liver weights of male rats administered 25 mg/kg allyl alcohol, female rats administered 50 mg/kg allyl acetate or 5 or 10 mg/kg acrolein, and male mice administered 10 mg/kg acrolein were significantly greater than those of the vehicle controls. Female rats administered 10 mg/kg acrolein had significantly lower absolute and relative thymus weights than did the vehicle controls. Female rats administered 25 mg/kg allyl alcohol spent more time in diestrus and less time in metestrus than the vehicle controls. The estrous cycles of female mice dosed with 16 or 32 mg/kg allyl acetate were significantly longer than that of the vehicle controls. Gross lesions related to allyl acetate treatment were observed in the liver, forestomach, and thorax/abdomen of male and female rats in the 100 mg/kg groups. Microscopically, the incidences of forestomach squamous epithelial hyperplasia were significantly increased in male rats administered 12 mg/kg or greater, female rats administered 25 or 50 mg/kg, male mice administered 32 or 62.5 mg/kg, and female mice administered 16, 32, or 62.5 mg/kg. Forestomach necrosis, hemorrhage, and inflammation were present in most rats in the 100 mg/kg groups, and the incidence of hemorrhage in 125 mg/kg male mice was increased; male mice in the 62.5 and 125 mg/kg groups and 125 mg/kg female mice had significantly increased incidences of glandular stomach hemorrhage. Increased incidences of several liver lesions occurred in male or female rats administered 50 or 100 mg/kg, and to a lesser extent in 25 mg/kg rats, 62.5 mg/kg male mice, and 125 mg/kg male and female mice. Bone marrow hyperplasia, hemorrhage or depletion in the mediastinal, mandibular, and mesenteric lymph nodes, hemorrhage and necrosis of the thymus, and hematopoietic cell proliferation of the red pulp were also observed in 100 mg/kg rats. Increased incidences of necrosis in the mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus were observed in 62.5 and 125 mg/kg mice. Male and female rats administered 6 mg/kg allyl alcohol or greater and male and female mice administered 12 mg/kg allyl alcohol or greater had significantly increased incidences of squamous hyperplasia of the forestomach epithelium. Female rats in the 25 mg/kg group had significantly increased incidences of bile duct hyperplasia and periportal hepatocyte hypertrophy in the liver. Incidences of portal cytoplasmic vacuolization were significantly increased in 50 mg/kg male mice and female mice in the 25 and 50 mg/kg groups. Gross lesions related to acrolein treatment were observed in the forestomach and glandular stomach of male and female rats in the 10 mg/kg groups and 20 mg/kg female mice. Microscopically, the incidences of squamous hyperplasia of the forestomach epithelium were significantly increased in male rats in the 5 and 10 mg/kg groups, female rats administered 2.5 mg/kg or greater, and male and female mice administered 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg. Male and female rats in the 10 mg/kg groups and 20 mg/kg male and female mice had significantly increased incidences of glandular stomach hemorrhage. Female mice in the 20 mg/kg group also had significantly increased incidences of glandular stomach inflammation and epithelial necrosis. Allyl acetate was mutagenic in S. typhimurium strains TA100 and TA1535, in the absence of S9 activation. With S9, no mutagenicity was detected in these two strains; negative results were obtained in strains TA97 and TA98, with and without S9. Allyl alcohol was not mutagenic in four strains of S. typhimurium, with or without S9 metabolic activation. Acrolein, tested in a preincubation protocol, was weakly mutagenic in S. typhimurium strain TA100 in the presence of 10% induced rat liver S9. Equivocal results were obtained in strains TA100 and TA1535 with 10% induced hamster liver S9. Negative results were obtained with TA97, TA98, and TA1538 under all test conditions, and acrolein gave negative results in all four S. typhimurium strains tested for mutation induction under a vapor protocol. No induction of micronuclei was noted in bone marrow erythrocytes of male rats administered allyl acetate by gavage three times at 24-hour intervals. No significant increases in micronucleated erythrocytes were noted in bone marrow samples from male rats administered allyl alcohol by intraperitoneal injection for 3 days. A small, but significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes was observed in the peripheral blood of female mice administered allyl acetate by gavage for 14 weeks; no increase was observed in male mice. No increases in the frequencies of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes were observed in the peripheral blood of male or female mice administered allyl alcohol or acrolein by gavage for 14 weeks. Acrolein induced sister chromatid exchanges in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells in the absence, but not the presence, of S9; it did not induce chromosomal aberrations, with or without S9.

851,"Coral reefs are diverse ecosystems that have a high density of biodiversity leading to intense competition among species. These species may produce unknown substances, many with pharmacological value. Chromonephthea braziliensis is an invasive soft coral from the Indo-Pacific Ocean that is possibly transported by oil platforms and whose presence can be a threat to a region's biodiversity. This species produces secondary metabolites that are responsible for inducing damage to the local ecosystem. In the present study, extracts were prepared from dried colonies of C. braziliensis (solvents: hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and methanol). We evaluated their mutagenicity using the Salmonella reverse mutation assay (TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA102 strains), their genotoxicity using the DNA breakage analysis and micronucleus assay, and scavenging activity using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl-free radical assay. Cytotoxicity and mutagenicity were not observed for any of the extracts. Genotoxicity was observed for the dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts at high concentrations, but no DNA damage was observed in the micronucleus assay. Scavenging activity was not detected. ",Is Chromonephthea braziliensis mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
852,"Aclacinomycin A was nonmutagenic, while most anthracycline drugs such as daunomycin and adriamycin are highly mutagenic in a Salmonella test. But its derivative, N-demethylaclacinomycin A, was mutagenic. Similarly, aclavin, a hydrolysis product of aclacinomycin A, was nonmutagenic, but N-demethylaclavin was mutagenic. N-Methyldaunomycin showed only weak mutagenicity, and N-dimethyldaunomycin was nonmutagenic. Thus, the amino moiety of anthracycline glycosides is concluded to be essential for mutagenesis. Bleomycins were nonmutagenic to most Salmonella tester strains such as TA98, TA100 and TA92 and also to a Escherichia coli strain WP2/uvrA. Bleomycins were weakly mutagenic to Salmonella TA102 and TA94 strains which were extremely sensitive to detect DNA cross linking agents.",Is Aclacinomycin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
853,"Context Seaweeds from the Mexican Pacific Ocean have not been evaluated as a source of chemoprotectants. Objective The objective of this study is to evaluate chemopreventive activities of the seaweeds Phaephyceae - Padina durvillaei (Dictyotaceae) - Rodhophyceae - Spyridia filamentosa (Spyridiaceae), Gracilaria vermiculophylla (Gracilariaceae) - and Chlorophyceae - Ulva expansa (Ulvaceae), Codium isabelae (Codiaceae), Rhizoclonium riparium (Cladophoraceae) and Caulerpa sertularioides (Caulerpaceae). Materials and methods Methanol, acetone and hexane seaweed extracts were assessed at 30 and 3 mg/mL on antioxidant capacity (DPPH and ABTS assays), 0.003-3.0 mg/plate on antimutagenic activity against AFB1 using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 tester strains in Ames test, and 12.5 to 100 μg/mL on antiproliferative activity on Murine B-cell lymphoma. Phenols, flavonoids and pigments content were also assessed as antioxidant compounds. Results Extraction yield was higher in methanol than in acetone and hexane extracts (6.4, 2.7 and 1.4% dw). Antioxidant capacity was higher in brown and green than in red seaweed species, particularly in P. durvillaei extracted in acetone (EC50  value= 16.9 and 1.56 mg/mL for DPPH and ABTS). Flavonoids and chlorophylls were identified as mainly antioxidant components; particularly in hexane extracts, which were correlated with the antioxidant capacity. Highest mutagenesis inhibition (> 40%) occurred in R. riparium at the lowest concentration assayed (0.003 mg/plate), while highest antiproliferative inhibition (37 and 72% for 12.5 and 25 μg/mL) occurred in C. sertularioides. Discussion and conclusion Flavonoids and chlorophylls explained the chemopreventive activities assessed in S. filamentosa, R. riparium and C. sertularioides. These seaweeds have a high potential as a source of novel chemoprotectants. ",Is seaweed extracts mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
854,"The metabolism and mutagenicity of the esophageal carcinogen N-nitroso-N-methylaniline (NMA) was studied using hepatic and esophageal 9000 X g supernatant (S-9) preparations from Sprague-Dawley rats induced with pyrazole and phenobarbital. Only pyrazole-induced hepatic S-9 was able to dose-dependently activate NMA to a mutagen in the Ames assay and specifically in Salmonella typhimurium TA1537. NMA in the presence of phenobarbital-induced S-9 gave a very weak non-dose dependent mutagenic response. Metabolism of NMA by the two induced hepatic and esophageal S-9 fractions yielded aniline and N-methylaniline (MA). Phenobarbital-induced S-9 from both tissues also afforded phenol, while none was found with the pyrazole-induced preparations. Phenol formation presumably arose from the direct oxidative demethylation of NMA via a benzenediazonium ion (BDI) intermediate. The results indicate that an important metabolic pathway for NMA, with both inducing agents, entails an initial denitrosation to yield MA, which in turn rapidly undergoes oxidative demethylation to aniline. The conversion of NMA to phenol also suggests that direct demethylation of NMA in the phenobarbital-induced system is an important metabolic pathway.",Is N-nitroso-N-methylaniline mutagenic for TA1537 strain?,True
855,"Tinidazole is an antiparasitic drug belonging to the 5-nitroimidazole family. It is prescribed against protozoal infestations and is widely used in Mexico as well as other underdeveloped countries where infectious diseases are the first cause of children mortality. The drug is a direct mutagen in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 strain and the presence of S9 mixture did not modify its mutagenic effect. At low doses no mutagenicity was detected with strains TA100NR, TA98 or UTH8414 (Uvr+ derivative of TA100). Urine from four patients under tinidazole treatment exhibited a mutagenic activity on strain TA100, greater than the expected from the tinidazole concentrations determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Components from the urine samples were separated on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates, and their mutagenic effects tested by direct application of the Salmonella assay onto sections of the developed chromatoplate. The Rf of one component (0.62) corresponded to the one obtained for a tinidazole standard and showed the expected mutagenicity, while a second component with an Rf=0.39, exhibited a mutagenic potency slightly greater than the observed for tinidazole; however, as in the case of the drug itself, reduction of the nitro group was necessary for a mutagenic activity.",Is Tinidazole mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

857,"In this article, the genotoxic and antigenotoxic effects of methanol extract of Evernia prunastri (Huds.) Willd. (MEP) were studied using WP2, Ames (TA1535 and TA1537) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test systems. The results obtained from bacterial test systems demonstrated that MEP has strong antimutagenic potencies on TA1537 and WP2 strains. The highest inhibition rates for MEP on TA1537 and WP2 strains were 37.70% and 69.70%, respectively. According to the SCE test system, MEP reduced the genotoxic effects of aflatoxin. In order to clarify the mechanism underlying the antigenotoxic effects of MEP, the antioxidants were determined. Cotreatments of 5, 10 and 20 µg/mL concentrations of MEP with aflatoxin B1 decreased the frequencies of SCE and the malondialdehyde level and increased amount of superoxide dismutase, glutathione and glutathione peroxidase which were decreased by aflatoxin. The data obtained from this work have clearly shown that MEP has significant antigenotoxic effects which are thought to be partly due to the antioxidant activities and antioxidant inducing capability of MEP. This is the first report indicating the antigenotoxic activities of MEP against several mutagen agents such as N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, acridin and aflatoxin.

858,"We studied the genotoxic potency of motorcycle exhaust particles (MEP) by using a bacterial reversion assay and chromosome aberration and micronucleus tests. In the bacterial reversion assay (Ames test), MEP concentration-dependently increased TA98, TA100, and TA102 revertants in the presence of metabolic-activating enzymes. In the chromosome aberration test, MEP concentration-dependently increased abnormal structural chromosomes in CHO-K1 cells both with and without S9. Pretreatment with antioxidants (alpha-tocopherol, ascorbate, catalase, and NAC) showed varying degrees of inhibitory effect on the MEP-induced mutagenic effect and chromosome structural abnormalities. In the in vivo micronucleus test, MEP dose-dependently induced micronucleus formation in peripheral red blood cells after 24 and 48 h of treatment. The increase of micronucleated reticulocytes induced by MEP was inhibited by pretreatment with alpha-tocopherol and ascorbate. The fluorescence intensity of DCFH-DA-loaded CHO-K1 cells was increased upon the addition of MEP. Our data suggest that MEP can induce genotoxicity through a reactive oxygen species-(ROS-) dependent pathway, which can be augmented by metabolic activation. Alpha-tocopherol, ascorbate, catalase, and NAC can inhibit MEP-induced genotoxicity, indicating that ROS might be involved in this effect.",Is MEP mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
859,"The mutagenic properties of 2-methylpropene (MP) and 2-methyl-1,2- epoxypropane (MEP) were investigated in the Salmonella assay. A simple exposure system, consisting of gastight tissue culture flasks, was used. This method has the advantage that the volatile test chemical is present during the entire incubation period and that several concentrations of the investigated compound can be tested on a single day. MP is not mutagenic in strains TA100, TA102 and TA1535, and in the latter strain not even in the presence of metabolizing S9 mix. MEP is mutagenic in all the strains tested, as demonstrated by a clear dose-response relationship. Strain TA1535 seems to be most sensitive to MEP compared with the other bacterial strains studied. For this strain, the mutagenic activity of MEP decreased significantly in the presence of S9 mix, compatible with the epoxide being inactivated by epoxide hydrolase and by glutathione S-transferase, as reported previously. From the present study it can be concluded that the parent compound MP is not mutagenic, but that its primary metabolite MEP is a mutagenic substance. However, very high concentrations are necessary to induce a mutagenic effect and the epoxide is efficiently detoxified by different liver enzymes.",Is MEP mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 strain?,False
860,"Chloral hydrate is used medically as a sedative or hypnotic and as a rubefacient in topical preparations, and it is often given to children as a sedative during dental and other medical procedures. Chloral hydrate is used as a central nervous system depressant and sedative in veterinary medicine and as a general anesthetic in cattle and horses. It is a byproduct of the chlorination of water and has been detected in plant effluent after the bleaching of softwood pulp. Chloral, the anhydrous form of chloral hydrate, is used as a synthetic intermediate in the production of insecticides and herbicides. Chloral hydrate was nominated for study by the Food and Drug Administration based upon widespread human exposure and its potential hepatotoxicity and the toxicity of related chemicals. One goal of the study was to assess the effect of the animal’s age and the duration of dosing on the tumorigenicity of chloral hydrate. Beginning on postnatal day 28, female B6C3F1 mice received chloral hydrate (99.5% pure) in water by gavage for 3, 6, or 12 months, 2 years, or as a single dose; on postnatal day 15, male and female B6C3F1 mice received a single dose by gavage. Tumorigenicity was assessed for 2 years after the initial dose. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, Drosophila melanogaster, and mouse bone marrow cells. 2-YEAR STUDY Groups of female mice (regimens A, B, C, and D) and groups of male mice (regimen E) received chloral hydrate in distilled water by gavage; control groups received distilled water only. In regimen A, groups of 48 female mice received 0, 25, 50, or 100 mg chloral hydrate/kg body weight 5 days per week for 104 weeks beginning when they were 28 days old. In regimen B, 24 female mice received 0 mg/kg and three groups of 48 female mice received 100 mg/kg 5 days per week beginning when they were 28 days old. Eight mice from the 0 and 100 mg/kg groups were killed at 3, 6, or 12 months. The remaining mice were held without dosing for the duration of the 2-year study. In regimen C, groups of 48 female mice received a single dose of 0, 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg when they were 28 days old and were held for 104 weeks. In regimens D and E, groups of 48 female and 48 male mice, respectively, received a single dose of 0, 10, 25 or 50 mg/kg when they were 15 days old and were held for 104 weeks. Additional groups of four mice from regimens C, D, and E and mice killed at 3 or 6 months from regimen B (eight mice per group) were designated for hepatic cell proliferation analyses; mice killed at 3 or 6 months in regimen B were also designated for apoptosis analyses. Survival and Body Weights Survival of all dosed mice in all regimens was similar to that of the vehicle control groups. Mean body weights of 100 mg/kg female mice in regimen B dosed for 3 or 6 months were generally greater than those of the vehicle controls during the second year of the study. Mean body weights of 25 mg/kg male mice in regimen E were generally less than those of the controls beginning at week 19; mean body weights of 10 and 50 mg/kg mice were generally less than those of the vehicle controls beginning at week 80. Pathology Findings A dose-related and significant increase in the incidence of pars distalis adenoma occurred in regimen A 100 mg/kg females. There was also a time-related increase in the incidence of adenoma in female mice administered 100 mg/kg for up to 24 months in regimen B, and the increase in the incidence of this neoplasm at 24 months was significant. There was a significant increase in the severity of pars distalis hyperplasia in regimen A 100 mg/kg female mice. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY Chloral hydrate was mutagenic in vitro and in vivo. It induced mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100, with and without liver S9 activation; an equivocal response was obtained in S. typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of S9, and no mutagenicity was detected with strain TA1535 or TA1537, with or without S9. Chloral hydrate was shown to produce chromosomal damage in mammalian cells. It induced significant increases in sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with and without S9. Results of sexlinked recessive lethal (SLRL) tests in Drosophila melanogaster were inconclusive. Chloral hydrate, administered by feeding, produced an inconclusive increase in SLRL mutations in the germ cells of male flies. Results of an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test with chloral hydrate were positive. CONCLUSIONS Under the conditions of this 2-year gavage study, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of chloral hydrate in female B6C3F1 mice treated continuously for two years based on increased incidences of pituitary gland pars distalis adenomas. No increased incidences of neoplasms were seen in female B6C3F1 mice that received a single dose of chloral hydrate at 15 or 28 days of age or in male B6C3F1 mice that received a single dose of chloral hydrate at 15 days of age. No hepatocarcinogenicity was seen under any dosing condition.",Is Chloral hydrate mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
861,"Chloral hydrate is widely used as a sedative and a hypnotic in pediatric medicine. It is also a byproduct of water chlorination. Chloral hydrate has been shown to be genotoxic in numerous prokaryotic and eukaryotic assay systems including human lymphocytes in vitro. One of its metabolites, trichloroacetic acid, has demonstrated hepatocarcinogenic activity in mice. Trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene, both of which are metabolized to chloral hydrate, have been shown to be carcinogenic in rats and/or mice. Because of this evidence of carcinogenicity and because of the wide-spread use of chloral hydrate, 16- or 17-day range-finding toxicity studies and separate 16- or 17-day metabolism studies were performed in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice in preparation for further long-term rodent studies. In addition, in vitro studies of the metabolism and DNA-binding capacity of chloral hydrate and its metabolites were performed. Genetic toxicity studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, Drosophila melanogaster, and mouse bone marrow cells. For the range-finding studies, groups of eight male and eight female F344/N Nctr BR rats and B6C3F1/Nctr BR (C57BL/6N x C3H/HeN MTV-) mice were administered 0, 50, 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg chloral hydrate per kg body weight in water by gavage 5 days per week for 17 days (rats) or 16 days (mice) for a total of 12 doses. One male rat receiving 800 mg/kg died after five doses. Two 800 mg/kg female rats died after dosing ended but before study termination. One male mouse in each group except the 400 mg/kg group died before the end of the study. Two 800 mg/kg female mice also died before the end of the study. The final mean body weight of 800 mg/kg male rats and the mean body weight gains of 400 and 800 mg/kg males were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls. The mean body weight gains of all groups of dosed male mice were significantly greater than that of the vehicle control group. The only clinical finding in rats and mice attributed to chloral hydrate treatment was light sedation in the 400 mg/kg groups and heavy sedation in the 800 mg/kg groups; sedation subsided within 30 minutes or 3 hours, respectively. The liver weights of 400 mg/kg male mice and 800 mg/kg male and female mice were significantly greater than those of the vehicle control groups. No chemical-related lesions were observed in rats or mice. Male and female rats and mice were administered a single dose of 50 or 200 mg chloral hydrate per kg body weight in water by gavage, or 12 doses of 50 or 200 mg/kg over 17 days (rats) or 16 days (mice). Plasma concentrations of chloral hydrate and its metabolites were determined 15 minutes, 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours, and 2, 4, 8, and 16 days after receiving 1 or 12 doses. Maximum concentrations of chloral hydrate were observed at the initial sampling point of 15 minutes. By 1 hour, the concentrations had dropped substantially, and by 3 hours, chloral hydrate could not be detected in rats or mice. Trichloroacetic acid was the major metabolite detected in the plasma. In rats, the concentrations rose slowly, with the peaks occurring between 1 and 6 hours after treatment. In mice, the peak concentrations were found 1 hour after dosing. The concentrations then slowly decreased such that by 2 days the metabolite could no longer be detected in rats or mice. Trichloroethanol was assayed both as the free alcohol and its glucuronide. In rats, the maximum concentrations of free trichloroethanol occurred at 15 minutes, while the peak concentrations of trichloroethanol glucuronide were found at 1 hour; by 3 hours, concentrations of both metabolites approached background levels. In mice, the maximum concentrations of both metabolites occurred at 15 minutes, and by 1 to 3 hours concentrations approached background levels. The plasma concentrations of chloral hydrate and its metabolites were dose dependent in rats and mice. In mice, plasma concentrations of trichloroacetic acid were significantly higher after a single dose than after 12 doses. None of the metabolic parameters appears to account for species differences that may exist in hepatocarcinogenicity. The data from the study of metabolism and DNA adduct formation indicated that in vitro metabolism of 200 microM to 5 mM chloral hydrate by male B6C3F1 mouse liver microsomes (control microsomes) generated free radical intermediates that resulted in endogenous lipid peroxidation, forming malondialdehyde, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propionaldehyde. Similar concentrations of trichloroacetic acid and trichloroethanol, the primary metabolites of chloral hydrate, also generated free radicals and induced lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation induced by trichloroacetic acid nearly equaled that induced by chloral hydrate, while that from trichloroethanol was three- to fourfold less. Metabolism of 200 microM to 5 mM chloral hydrate, trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroethanol by liver microsomes of B6C3F1 mice pretreated with pyrazole (pyrazole-induced microsomes) yielded lipid peroxidation products at concentrations two- to threefold greater than those from liver microsomes of untreated mice. Additionally, chloral hydrate-induced lipid peroxidation catalyzed by control and pyrazole-induced microsomes was reduced significantly by 2,4-dichloro-6-phenylphenoxyethylamine, a general cytochrome P450 inhibitor. Human lymphoblastoid transgenic cells expressing cytochrome P(450)2E1 metabolized 200 to 5,000 micrograms/mL chloral hydrate to reactants inducing mutations, whereas the parental cell line was inactive. The malondialdehyde-modified DNA adduct, 3-(2-deoxy-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)pyrimido[1,2 alpha]purin-10(3H)-one (MDA-MG-1), formed from the metabolism of 1 mM chloral hydrate, trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroethanol by control B6C3F1 mouse liver microsomes, mouse pyrazole-induced microsomes, male F344/N rat liver microsomes, and human liver microsomes in the presence and absence of calf thymus DNA was also determined. When incubated in the absence of calf thymus DNA, the amount of malondialdehyde formed from metabolism by pyrazole-induced mouse microsomes was twice that from rat or human liver microsomes. Amounts of chloral hydrate-induced and trichloroacetic acid-induced lipid peroxidation products formed from metabolism by rat and human liver microsomes were similar, and these quantities were about twice those formed from the metabolism of trichloroethanol. The quantity of MDA-MG-1 formed from the metabolism of chloral hydrate, trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroethanol by mouse, rat, and human liver microsomes exhibited a linear correlation with the quantity of malondialdehyde formed under incubation conditions in the absence of calf thymus DNA. Chloral hydrate was shown to be mutagenic in vitro and in vivo. At doses from 1,000 to 10,000 micrograms/plate, it induced mutations in S. typhimurium strain TA100, with and without S9 activation; an equivocal response was obtained in S. typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of S9, and no mutagenicity was detected with strain TA1535 or TA1537. Chloral hydrate at doses from 1,700 to 5,000 micrograms/mL induced sister chromatid exchanges; at doses from 1,000 to 3,000 micrograms/mL, chromosomal aberrations were induced in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with and without S9. Results of a sex-linked recessive lethal test in D. melanogaster were unclear; administration of chloral hydrate by feeding produced an inconclusive increase in recessive lethal mutations, results of the injection experiment were negative. An in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test with chloral hydrate at doses from 125 to 500 mg/kg gave a positive dose trend. In summary, due to the absence of chloral hydrate-induced histopathologic lesions in rats and mice, no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) were based on body weights of rats and liver weights of mice. The NOAELs for rats and mice were 200 mg/kg. Chloral hydrate was rapidly metabolized by rats and mice, with trichloroacetic acid occurring as the major metabolite. Peak concentrations of trichloroacetic acid occurred more quickly in mice. Plasma concentrations of chloral hydrate were dose dependent, but metabolic rates were unaffected by dose or sex. Chloral hydrate was mutagenic in vitro and in vivo. Metabolism of chloral hydrate and its metabolites produced free radicals that resulted in lipid peroxidation in liver microsomes of mice, rats, and humans. Induction of cytochrome P(450)2E1 by pyrazole increased the concentrations of lipid peroxidation products; inhibition of cytochrome P(450)2E1 by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine reduced these concentrations. Metabolism of chloral hydrate and its metabolites by mouse, rat, and human liver microsomes formed malondialdehyde, and in the presence of calf thymus DNA formed the DNA adduct MDA-MG-1.",Is Chloral hydrate mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
862,"We review 23 studies on the potential genotoxicity of electric and magnetic fields that have appeared in the published literature since our 1993 review of 55 published studies (McCann et al., Mutat. Res. 297 (1993) 61-95) and six additional studies published prior to 1993, which were not previously reviewed. As in our previous review, internal electric fields present in media (for in vitro experiments) and in the torso (for in vivo experiments) were estimated. Individual experiments are evaluated using basic data quality criteria. The potential for genotoxicity of electric and magnetic fields is discussed in light of the significant body of genotoxicity data that now exists. Three unsuccessful attempts to replicate previously reported positive results have appeared since our previous review. We conclude that, in spite of the 34 studies reviewed in this and our previous publication that report positive genotoxic effects, none satisfy all of three basic conditions: independent reproducibility, consistency with the scientific knowledge base, and completeness according to basic data quality criteria. As we discuss, these criteria are satisfied for several groups of negative studies in several exposure categories (ELF magnetic fields, 150 microT-5 mT, combined ELF electric and ELF magnetic fields, approx. 0.2 mT, 240 mV/m, and static magnetic fields, 1-3.7 T). The evidence reviewed here strengthens the conclusion of our previous review, that the preponderance of evidence suggests that ELF electric or magnetic fields do not have genotoxic potential. Nevertheless, a pool of positive results remains, which have not yet been tested by independent replication. Among the 12 studies reviewed here, which report statistically significant or suggestive positive results, we point particularly to results from five laboratories [J. Miyakoshi, N. Yamagishi, S.

863,"There is currently limited knowledge regarding the impact of different cigarette designs on the toxicological properties of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC). This study used the Salmonella Mutagenicity Assay to examine the mutagenic activity of mainstream CSCs from 11 commercial Canadian cigarette brands with different design features or tobacco blend. The brands were selected to include design features that are common for cigarettes sold in the Canadian market, as well as cigarettes with alternate filters (charcoal or MicroBlue™), the super slim design, and cigarettes containing mixed blends of different tobacco types. CSCs were obtained using the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Health Canada Intense (HCI) smoking regimes, and mutagenic activity was assessed using Salmonella strains TA98, YG1041 and YG5185. Comparisons of the commercial brands to the Kentucky 3R4F, the Canadian Monitor 8 reference and a Canadian best seller revealed no significant reduction in CSC mutagenicity for cigarettes with alternate filters. However, the super slim design did afford some reduction in mutagenic potency. Nevertheless, since the study did not attempt to evaluate the impact of the cigarette designs on human health at the individual or population level, the super slim cigarettes cannot be considered 'reduced-harm' cigarettes.

864,"Primidone is used alone or with other anticonvulsants in the control of grand mal, psychomotor, and focal epileptic seizures. It may control grand mal seizures refractory to other anticonvulsant therapy. Primidone was nominated by the National Cancer Institute for 2-year toxicology and carcinogenicity studies due to its human use as an anticonvulsant. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice received primidone (greater than 99% pure) in feed for 14 days, 14 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and mouse bone marrow cells. 14-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Five male and five female rats were exposed to 0, 1,250, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000 or 20,000 ppm primidone (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 120, 240, 500, 970, or 1,100 mg primidone/kg body weight to males and 120, 240, 500, or 900 mg/kg to females) in feed for 14 days. All 20,000 ppm females died before the end of the study as did one 10,000 ppm male and two 20,000 ppm males. The mean body weights of 10,000 ppm males and females and 20,000 ppm males were significantly less than those of the controls. Feed consumption by all exposed rats was generally similar to that by the controls. Males and females in the 10,000 and 20,000 ppm groups were observed to have eye discharge, ataxia, and abnormal posture and were thin and lethargic. 14-DAY STUDY IN MICE: Five male and five female mice were exposed to 0, 625, 1,250, 2,500, 5,000 or 10,000 ppm primidone (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg/kg body weight to males and 100, 250, 500, or 900 mg/kg to females) in feed for 14 days. All mice in the 10,000 ppm groups and one male and one female mouse in the 5,000 ppm groups died on day 3 of the study. The mean body weights of mice in the 625, 1,250, 2,500, and 5,000 ppm groups were similar to those of the controls. Feed consumption by all exposed mice was generally similar to that by the controls. Males and females in the 10,000 ppm groups were observed to have abnormal posture, ataxia, and lethargy. 14-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed to 0, 300, 600, 1,300, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm primidone (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 20, 40, 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg) in feed for 14 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study. The mean body weights of male and female rats in the 2,500 and 5,000 ppm groups were significantly less than those of the controls. Feed consumption by all exposed rats was generally similar to that by the controls. A minimal to mild exposure-related thrombocytosis occurred on day 22 and at week 14 in all exposed groups of male rats and in females in the 1,300 ppm or greater groups. A minimal decrease in hemoglobin concentration occurred in 2,500 and 5,000 ppm male and female rats on day 22 and at week 14. The incidences of centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy in male rats exposed to 600 ppm or greater and in female rats exposed to 1,300 ppm or greater were significantly greater than those in the controls. The severity of chronic nephropathy in male rats exposed to 1,300 ppm or greater increased with increasing exposure concentration. 14-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were exposed to 0, 300, 600, 1,300, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm primidone (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 50, 100, 200, 400, or 1,000 mg/kg to males and 60, 120, 220, 440, or 1,100 mg/kg to females) in feed for 14 weeks. Three male and two female mice in the 5,000 ppm group died during week 1 of the study. The final mean body weights of all exposed groups were similar to those of the controls. Feed consumption by male mice in the 5,000 ppm group was slightly greater than that by the controls; this may have been due to feed spillage. Male and female mice in the 5,000 ppm groups were ataxic and lethargic. Compared to controls, the estrous cycle lengths of females exposed to 1,300, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm were significantly longer. The liver weights of male and female mice exposed to 600 po 600 ppm or greater were significantly greater than those of the controls. The incidences of centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy in all exposed males and in females exposed to 600 ppm or greater and the incidences of cytoplasmic alteration of the adrenal gland and hematopoietic cell proliferation of the spleen in 2,500 and 5,000 ppm males and in 5,000 ppm females were significantly greater than in the controls. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats were exposed to 0, 600, 1,300, or 2,500 ppm primidone (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg) in feed for 2 years. Survival, Body Weights, and Feed Consumption Survival of the 1,300 and 2,500 ppm males was sig nificantly less than that of the controls. The mean body weights of males and females in the 2,500 ppm groups were less than those of the controls, beginning at week 29 for males and week 17 for females; the mean body weights of 1,300 ppm males and females were less than those of the controls during the second year of the study. Feed consumption by all exposed groups of rats was generally similar to that by the controls. Pathology Findings Male rats exposed to primidone had increased inci dences of thyroid gland follicular cell neoplasms (adenoma and/or carcinoma). All exposed groups of male rats had follicular cell adenomas or carcinomas (combined) at incidences above the historical control range, with the highest incidence in the 1,300 ppm group. Hepatocyte cytoplasmic vacuolation and centrilobular hypertrophy were associated with primidone exposure in male and female rats. These changes were more severe in females than in males and the incidences in all exposed groups of females were significantly greater than those in the controls. Females in the 2,500 ppm group had an increased incidence of hepatocellular eosinophilic foci. In 2,500 ppm males, the incidence of renal tubule hyperplasia was greater than that in the controls in the standard evaluation. Additional hyperplasias were found in the extended evaluation, and the incidences in exposed groups of males were significantly greater than that in the controls. In the extended evaluation, the incidence of renal tubule adenoma in 2,500 ppm males was significantly increased. The incidence of adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in 2,500 ppm males in the combined standard and extended evaluations were marginally increased over those in the controls. Male rats had an exposure-related increase in the severity of chronic nephropathy, which probably accounted for the reduced survival in the 1,300 and 2,500 ppm groups. The incidences of kidney cysts were increased in 1,300 and 2,500 ppm males. Hyperparathyroidism, secondary to the loss of renal function, was present in many exposed male rats. The incidences of parathyroid gland hyperplasia in all groups of exposed males were significantly greater than that in the controls. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were exposed to dietary levels of 0, 300, 600, or 1,300 ppm primidone (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 30, 65, or 150 mg/kg to males and 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg to females) in feed for 2 years. Survival, Body Weights, Feed Consumption, and Clinical Findings Survival of the 1,300 ppm males was significantly less than that of the controls. During the second year of the study, the mean body weights of 1,300 ppm male and female mice were less than those of the controls. The final mean body weights of 600 ppm males and females were less than those of the controls. Feed consumption by all exposed groups of mice was similar to that by the controls. During the latter part of the study, a treatment-related increase in the number of animals with swelling of the abdominal area was observed; necropsy revealed that the swelling was due to liver nodules/masses. Pathology Findings The liver was a target organ in both male and female mice. The incidences and multiplicities of hepatocellular neoplasms (hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatoblastoma) in all exposed groups of males and females (except hepatoblastoma in females) were significantly greater than those in the controls. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) and hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, or hepatoblastoma (combined) in all exposed groups exceeded the historical control ranges in 2-year NTP studies. The incidences of centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy were increased in exposed groups of males and females, and the severities increased with increasing exposure concentration. The incidences of cytoplasmic vacuolization were increased in all exposed groups of females and in 300 ppm males. Incidences of eosinophilic focus in all exposed groups of females were significantly greater than those in the controls. Proliferative changes occurred in the thyroid gland in an exposure-related manner in male and female mice. Incidences of follicular cell hyperplasia were increased in all exposed groups of males and in 600 and 1,300 ppm females, but incidences of follicular cell adenomas were increased only in male mice. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Primidone was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535 in the absence of S9 activation only; no mutagenicity was detected in strain TA98, TA100, or TA1537, with or without S9. Primidone did not induce sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with or without S9. The single in vivo study with primidone, a mouse bone marrow micronucleus test, also gave negative results. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of primidone in male F344/N rats based on a marginal increase in thyroid gland follicular cell neoplasms, primarily adenomas, and a marginal increase in renal tubule neoplasms. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of primidone in female F344/N rats exposed to 600, 1,300, or 2,500 ppm. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of primidone in male B6C3F1 mice based on the increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms, and the increased incidence of thyroid gland follicular cell adenomas was also considered to be chemical related. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of primidone in female B6C3F1 mice based on the increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms. Exposure of rats to primidone resulted in increased incidences of hepatocyte cytoplasmic vacuolization and centrilobular hypertrophy in males and females and eosinophilic foci in females. The increased severity of nephropathy and increased incidence of renal tubule hyperplasia in male rats were related to primidone exposure. Exposure of male mice to primidone resulted in hepatocyte centrilobular hypertrophy and thyroid gland follicular cell hyperplasia. Exposure of female mice to primidone resulted in hepatocyte centrilobular hypertrophy and cytoplasmic vacuolization, eosinophilic focus, and thyroid gland follicular cell hyperplasia.

865,"As a part of safety tests of tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC), the reverse mutation tests using bacteria, the chromosomal aberration tests using cultured cells and the micronucleus tests using male mice were conducted in order to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo mutagenicity of TAZ, PIPC, TAZ/PIPC. 1. The reverse mutation tests were carried out on TAZ, PIPC and TAZ/PIPC at dose ranges, where few antibacterial effects could be detected, using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA98 and TA1537, and Escherichia coli WP2uvrA. All of three test articles showed that no significant increases were observed in the number of colonies in all tester strains in both systems, with and without mammalian metabolic activation (S9 Mix), as compared with solvent controls. 2. The chromosomal aberration tests were carried out on these test articles using cultured Chinese hamster lung cells (CHL). The cells were treated with TAZ, PIPC or TAZ/PIPC at the doses of 2.5, 5.0 and 10 mM with and without S9 Mix. In the test of PIPC with S9 Mix, the dose of 1.25 mM was set in addition to the three doses. The incidences of structural- and numeral-aberration were 0-3% in the absence or presence of mammalian metabolic activation system, and no significant increases were observed in the incidence of chromosomal aberrations as compared with solvent controls. 3. The micronucleus tests were carried out at doses of 625-5000 mg/kg of TAZ or TAZ/PIPC, or at 625-2500 mg/kg of PIPC. The femoral marrow cells were 48 h after administering intravenously to CD-1 male mice. The frequencies of polychromatic erythrocyte with micronuclei were 0.02-0.17%, 0.02-0.10% and 0.03-0.07% in the groups treated with TAZ, PIPC and TAZ/PIPC, respectively, and no significant increases were observed with dose dependence. The results indicated that these test articles were negative in the assessment standard using the background data. 4. The present study indicates that TAZ, PIPC and TAZ/PIPC have no in vitro and in vivo mutagenic potential.",Is TAZ mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or WP2uvrA or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
866,"An assay for the ability of antioxidants to prevent mutations induced by various oxidants in Salmonella typhimurium TA102 cells was developed. Protection against hydrogen-peroxide-induced mutagenicity was observed for quercetin, caffeic acid, ascorbic acid and dimethyl sulfoxide (used as a solvent for water-insoluble antioxidants). No protective effect was observed for green tea extract (weakly pro-oxidative), catechin, rutin, sinigrin, ferulic acid and alpha-tocopherol. Mutagenicity caused by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH) was prevented most effectively by quercetin and ascorbic acid, whereas weaker effects were observed for green tea extract and for rutin, and no effect being observed for the other antioxidants tested. The results for hydrogen peroxide indicate iron chelation to be the most important protective mechanism. Radical scavenging appeared to be effective only with dimethyl sulfoxide and ascorbic acid, which are effective scavengers of hydroxyl radicals and were used here in high concentrations. It is proposed that the hydrogen-peroxide-induced mutations in the Salmonella cells are caused by hydroxyl radicals generated by iron ions closely associated with DNA. Protection against mutagenicity caused by tert-butyl hydroperoxide appears to occur mainly through the scavenging of alkoxyl and possibly of alkyl radicals.",Is hydrogen-peroxide mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True
867,"Ferulic, caffeic, chlorogenic, and ellagic acids, four naturally occurring plant phenols, inhibit the mutagenicity and cytotoxicity of (+/-)-7beta,8alpha-dihydroxy-9alpha, 10alpha-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2), the only known ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of benzo[a]pyrene. The mutagenicity of 0.05 nmol of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2 in strain TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium is inhibited 50% by incubation of the bacteria and the diol epoxide with 150 nmol of ferulic acid, 75 nmol of caffeic acid, 50 nmol of chlorogenic acid or, most strikingly, 1 nmol of ellagic acid in the 0.5-ml incubation mixture. A 3-nmol dose of ellagic acid inhibits mutation induction by 90%. Ellagic acid is also a potent antagonist of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2 in Chinese hamster V79 cells. Mutations to 8-azaguanine resistance induced by 0.2 muM diol epoxide are reduced by 50% when tissue culture media also contains 2 muM ellagic acid. Similar to results obtained with the bacteria, ferulic, caffeic, and chlorogenic acids are approximately two orders of magnitude less active than ellagic acid in the mammalian cell assay. The antimutagenic effects of the plant phenols result from their direct interaction with B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2, because a concentration-dependent increase in the rate of diol epoxide disappearance in cell-free solutions of 1:9 dioxane/water, pH 7.0, is observed with all four phenols. In parallel with the mutagenicity studies, ellagic acid is 80-300 times more effective than the other phenols in accelerating the disappearance of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2. Ellagic acid at 10 muM increases the disappearance of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2 by approximately 20-fold relative to the spontaneous and hydronium ion-catalyzed hydrolysis of the diol epoxide at pH 7.0. Ellagic acid is a highly potent inhibitor of the mutagenic activity of bay-region diol epoxides of benzo[a]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, and dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, but higher concentrations of ellagic acid are needed to inhibit the mutagenic activity of the chemically less reactive bay-region diol epoxides of benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, and benzo[c]phenanthrene. These studies demonstrate that ellagic acid is a potent antagonist of the adverse biological effects of the ultimate carcinogenic metabolites of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and suggest that this naturally occurring plant phenol, normally ingested by humans, may inhibit the carcinogenicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.",Is ferulic acid mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
868,"The mutagenicity of rutacridone and rutacridone epoxide was investigated using Salmonella typhimurium without as well as with different metabolic activation systems. Rutacridone epoxide was found to be a direct acting mutagen in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100 and TA1538; addition of rat liver preparations resulted in a marked decrease of mutagenicity. In contrast, rutacridone required metabolic conversion to exhibit mutagenic activity. Neither of the compounds had any effect on tester strain TA1978. S9 mixes as well as microsomal and cytosolic preparations from untreated, phenobarbital-treated and 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats were used to study the activation and deactivation capacities of the enzyme mixtures. In addition, the influence of enzyme inhibitors on the activation and deactivation of the furoacridones were tested. Evidence is presented that rutacridone is metabolized by rat liver enzymes to the corresponding epoxide as the ultimate mutagen.",Is Rutacridone epoxide mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
869,"Previous studies showed that binary mixtures of the environmental pollutants 1- and 3-nitrobenzo[a]pyrene produced a synergistic mutational response in the Salmonella reversion assay. Since nitroreduction is believed to mediate the direct-acting mutagenicity of the individual compounds, we have examined the role of nitroreduction in the mutagenicity of mixtures of 1- and 3-nitrobenzo[a]pyrene in the Salmonella plate incorporation assay. While mixtures of 1- and 3-nitrobenzo[a]pyrene induced up to 183% more revertants in strain TA98 than produced by equivalent amounts of the individual compounds, in the nitroreductase-deficient strain TA98NR the same mixtures only induced up to 57% more revertants than the individual compounds. Analysis of mixtures of 1- and 3-nitrosobenzo[a]pyrene (the two-electron reduction products of 1- and 3-nitrobenzo[a]pyrene) for mutation induction in TA98 yielded no evidence of a synergistic effect between the compounds. The mutagenicity of the mixtures was dependent upon the amount of the more mutagenic component. Salmonella cultures were also incubated with mixtures of 1- and 3-nitrobenzo[a]pyrene, as well as with equivalent amounts of the individual compounds. In two experiments, nitroreductive ability, as measured by the amount of 1-nitropyrene metabolized to 1-aminopyrene in 1 hr, was increased 9 to 105% in cultures pretreated with the mixtures as compared with cultures pretreated with the individual compounds. The results of this study support the hypothesis that nitroreduction is a major factor in the synergistic mutational response induced by 1- and 3-nitrobenzo[a]pyrene in Salmonella typhimurium.",Is 3-nitrobenzo[a]pyrene mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
870,"N-Nitrodimethylamine, N-nitrodiethylamine, N-nitromorpholine and their N-nitroso analogs, N-nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosodiethylamine, and N-nitrosomorpholine, were tested in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA1530. The mutagenicity of all compounds, except N-nitrodiethylamine, was demonstrated in liquid incubation assays in at least one of the tester strains; it required the presence of a postmitochondrial supernatant from the liver of Aroclor-treated rats, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-generating system, and oxygen. When compared on a molar basis with their N-nitroso analogs, N-nitromorpholine was about 10 times less mutagenic and N-nitrodimethylamine about 70 times less mutagenic. Addition of disulfiram to the assays at a final concentration of 0.1 mM efficiently inhibited mutagenesis by all nitro and nitroso compounds; ascorbic acid at a 7.4 mM concentration produced less inhibition. Mutagenic activity of the three nitramines was also determined in the host-mediated assay in rats. After p.o. administration of each of the N-nitramines, cells of S. typhimurium strains TA1530 and TA100 that had been injected i.p. were isolated from the peritoneal liquid after 1, 3, and 6 hr. All three nitramines were found to be mutagenic for strain TA1530 but not for TA100. Mutation frequencies (number of histidine revertants per 10(6) surviving cells) were in the descending order N-nitromorpholine greater than N-nitrodiemethylamine greater than N-nitrodiethylamine. After a p.o. dose of N-nitrodiethylamine to rats, bacteria were also isolated from liver, lungs, and kidneys. Mutation frequency was highest in bacteria recovered from the liver but was not increased in those obtained from lungs and kidneys. The data suggest that carcinogenic nitramines exert their mutagenic effects through the formation of alkylating intermediates.",Is N-Nitrodimethylamine mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
871,"Oxidized metabolites of 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MBOCA) were tested for direct mutagenicity in a Salmonella typhimurium assay and for effects on gap-junctional communication of WB-F344 rat liver cells. The mutagenicities of the N-hydroxy, mononitroso and o-hydroxy (ring) metabolites of MBOCA were assayed without adding activating enzyme systems, using the frame-shift sensitive strain TA98 and the base pair substitution sensitive strain TA100. The mutagenicity of the hydroxylamine was demonstrated by a linear increase in the formation of mutant colonies in both strains, with a formation of two revertants/nmol by TA98 and 21 revertants/nmol by TA100. The mononitroso metabolite showed a slight positive effect on TA100, but effects were masked by its cytotoxicity towards this strain. This metabolite was neither mutagenic nor cytotoxic to TA98. The o-hydroxy and the dinitroso metabolites were negative for mutagenicity at concentrations up to 50 and 500 micrograms/plate, respectively. The effects of parent MBOCA and N-hydroxy, mononitroso and o-hydroxy metabolites on cell-cell communication were determined by a scrape loading/fluorescent dye transfer technique. Cytotoxicity was assessed by determination of colony-forming efficiency and lactate dehydrogenase release. MBOCA itself caused an inhibition of dye transfer at concentrations of 7.5, 11.3 and 15 nmol/ml, whereas measures of cytotoxicity were not seen until 15 and 30 nmol/ml for LDH release and plating efficiency, respectively. None of the oxidized metabolites were active in inhibiting dye transfer at non-cytotoxic concentrations.",Is MBOCA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
872,"The phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor Roflumilast (B9302-107) (RF) and its metabolite 4-amino-3,5-dichloropyridine (ADCP) produced nasal toxicity in preclinical safety studies with rats. The purpose of this study was to assess the possible formation of DNA adducts, by RF and ADCP, in the nasal mucosa, liver and testes of male rats using the 32P-postlabeling assay. For comparison, rats were exposed to the DNA-reactive carcinogens 2,6-dimethylaniline (DMA), also known as 2,6-xylidine, a nasal carcinogen, and the aromatic amine carcinogens 4,4'-methylene-bis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA), which yields monocyclic DNA adducts, and 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF). In the case of RF, possible sources of DNA adducts include the parent molecule and its ADCP moiety by enzymatic N-hydroxylation and sulfation, reactions typical of carcinogenic aromatic amines. 4-Acetoxylamino-3,5-dichloropyridine (N-acetoxy-ADCP), a chemically activated derivative of ADCP, was prepared and used to modify DNA which was then used to establish the chromatographic conditions with which to reliably detect whether or not such adducts were formed metabolically from RF and ADCP. Similarly, a standard N-hydroxy-DMA was prepared, but the corresponding N-acetoxy derivative was unstable and decomposed during synthesis. Both N-hydroxy-DMA and N-acetoxy-ADCP were mutagenic in the Salmonella typhimurium Ames assay using strain TA100 without an exogenous bioactivation system, with the former being more potent. N-hydroxy-ADCP was essentially inactive in this assay. For the 32P-postlabeling assay, male Wistar rats were exposed to the test substances and carrier control compounds by intragastric instillation at the selected dose levels for 7 days. Subsequently, the nasal mucosa, liver, and testes of the rats exposed to the test or control compounds were extirpated, the DNA extracted and the samples postlabeled. The patterns of adducts formed with the test compounds were compared to those formed in N-acetoxy-ADCP- and N-hydroxy-DMA-adducted DNA, which were assayed by both nuclease P1 and butanol enhancement methods. Based upon the similarity of results from the two enhancement methods, only the former was used for the in vivo studies. No evidence was obtained for the formation of DNA adducts from RF or its metabolites, specifically ADCP, under the conditions of these assays despite the ability to detect adducts from DNA modified chemically with N-acetoxy-ADCP and DNA adducts from the other compounds in their target organs. In the absence of a pattern of compound-related spots, we conclude that RF does not form DNA adducts having the potential to initiate neoplasia in these three tissues.",Is N-hydroxy-DMA mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
873,"Various substituted aniline derivatives were tested for genotoxicity in several short-term tests in order to examine the hypothesis that a substitution at both ortho positions (2,6-disubstitution) could prevent genotoxicity due to steric hindrance of an enzymatic activation to electrophilic intermediates. In the Salmonella/microsome assay, 2,6-dialkylsubstituted anilines and 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (2,4,6-TMA) were weakly mutagenic in strain TA100 when 20% S9 mix was used, although effects were small compared to those of 2,4-dimethylaniline and 2,4,5-trimethylaniline (2,4,5-TMA). In Drosophila melanogaster, however, 2,4,6-TMA and 2,4,6-trichloroaniline (TCA) were mutagenic in the wing spot test at 2-3 times lower doses than 2,4,5-TMA. In the 6-thioguanine resistance test in cultured fibroblasts, 2,4,6-TMA was again mutagenic at lower doses than 2,4,5-TMA. Two methylene-bis-aniline derivatives were also tested with the above methods: 4,4'-methylene-bis-(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA) was moderately genotoxic in all 3 test systems whereas 4,4'-methylene-bis-(2-ethyl-6-methylaniline) (MMEA) showed no genotoxicity at all. DNA binding studies in rats, however, revealed that both MOCA and MMEA produced DNA adducts in the liver at levels typically found for moderately strong genotoxic carcinogens. These results indicate that the predictive value of the in vitro test systems and particularly the Salmonella/microsome assay is inadequate to detect genotoxicity in aromatic amines. Genotoxicity seems to be a general property of aniline derivatives and does not seem to be greatly influenced by substitution at both ortho positions.",Is MOCA mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
874,"4,4'-methylene-bis-(2-chloroaniline) (""MOCA"") and two identified urinary N-acetyl and N,N'-diacetyl derivatives were tested in a Salmonella/mammalian microsome assay. No mutagenic activity was observed without rat liver S9 mix activation. In the presence of rat liver S9 mix, the chemicals were mutagens, but the mutagenicity of N-acetyl derivatives to strain TA100 was reduced when compared to that of ""MOCA"", and a greater amount of S9 was required to exhibit the mutagenicity of the N,N'-diacetyl-""MOCA"". These data suggest that N-acetylation does not account for the mutagenic effectiveness of ""MOCA"".",Is MOCA mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
875,"The implications of disinfection by-products (DBPs) present in drinking water are of public health concern because of their potential mutagenic, carcinogenic and other toxic effects on humans. In this study, we selected 13 main DBPs found in drinking water to quantitatively analyse their cytotoxicity and genotoxicity using a microplate-based cytotoxicity assay and a developed SOS/umu assay in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. With the developed SOS/umu test, eight DBPs: 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2[5H]-fura3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2-[5H]-furanone (MX), dibromoacetonitrile (DBN), iodoacetic acid (IA), bromochloroacetonitrile (BCN), bromoacetic acid (BA), trichloroacetonitrile (TCN), dibromoacetic acid (DBA) and dichloroacetic acid (DCA) were significantly genotoxic to S. typhimurium. Three DBPs: chloroacetic acid (CA), trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and dichloroacetonitrile (DCN) were weakly genotoxic, whereas the remaining DBPs: chloroacetonitrile (CN) and chloral hydrate (CH) were negative. The rank order in decreasing genotoxicity was as follows: MX > DBN > IA > BCN > BA > TCN > DBA > DCA > CA, TCA, DCN > CN, CH. MX was approximately 370 000 times more genotoxic than DCA. In the microplate-based cytotoxicity assay, cytotoxic potencies of the 13 DBPs were compared and ranked in decreasing order as follows: MX > IA > DBN > BCN > BA > TCN > DCN > CA > DCA > DBA > CN > TCA > CH. MX was approximately 19 200 times more cytotoxic than CH. A statistically significant correlation was found between cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the 13 DBPs in S. typhimurium. Results suggest that microplate-based cytotoxicity assay and the developed SOS/umu assay are feasible tools for analysing the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of DBPs, particularly for comparing their toxic intensities quantitatively.",Is DBN mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,False
876,"Using the Ames Salmonella/microsome assay, we compared the antimutagenic activities of chlorophyllin, retinol, beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E against solvent extracts of coal dust, diesel emission particles, airborne particles, fried beef, and tobacco snuff. The results show that chlorophyllin inhibited 69% of the mutagenic activity of tobacco snuff and over 90% of that of the other 4 complex mixtures. Retinol inhibited 29-48% of the mutagenic activity of all 5 complex mixtures. beta-Carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E inhibited, if any, less than 39% of the activity of the complex mixtures studied. Vitamin C enhanced the mutagenicity of airborne particles. These results indicate that for these dietary and environmental complex mixtures chlorophyllin is a more effective antimutagen than retinol, beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E.",Is beta-Carotene mutagenic for nan strain?,False
877,"Benzo(ghi)perylene (B(ghi))Per, (191-24-2)) and coronene (Cor, (191-07-1)) are major constituents of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) found in automobile exhaust and polluted air [eg, Grimmer et al, 1981]. Nitration of these PAH by NO2 and traces of HNO3, which are also formed in automobile exhaust, seems highly probable. To identify the presence of these nitroarenes in environmental samples and to examine their mutagenic potencies we synthesized and characterized nitro derivatives of both PAH. 5-NO2B(ghi)Per (81316-87-2) and 1-NO2Cor (81316-84-9) produced 405 and 340 revertants/nmole respectively in TA98 in the presence of 0.6 mg of microsomal enzymes (S-9) per plate in the Ames test. 5,8-diNO2B(ghi)Per (83292-25-5) and 5,10-diNO2B(ghi)Per (83292-26-6) produced 21,500 and 4,000 revertants/nmole in TA98 without microsomal activation. Mutagenicity for the dinitrobenzo(ghi)perylenes was also high in TA98NR and TA97 but was reduced by 97% in TA98-1,8DNP. There is close similarity in the orientation and distances between reactive sites (nitrenium ion and carbocation) on the dinitrobenzo(ghi)perylenes and 1,6-dinitropyrene (42397-64-8) and 1,8-dinitropyrene (42397-65-9).",Is 191-24-2 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
878,"The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been recognized as carcinogens and mutagens since the early part of this century. More recently their aza and polyaza derivatives have been shown to have the same biological activity. A major source of these compounds is the combustion of fresh or metamorphosed plant materials; this contributes to the environmental burden of, and exposure to, these carcinogens. We report the synthesis and characterization of a series of novel 5,8-diazabenzo[c]phenanthrenes which are isosteric with the known epidermal carcinogen benzo[c]phenanthrene but have not yet been reported as components of soot or diesel particulate matter. The synthesis of the compounds exploits a versatile, double Friedlander reaction between the appropriately substituted 2,2'-diaminobenzophenone and beta-diketones, with yields of purified product ranging from 30-90%. The nucleophilic substitution of these diazabenzophenanthrenes with ethanolamine is also described. This strategy will enable further elaboration of these heterocyclic nuclei at a later date. Mutagenicity testing of these agents was performed using spot tests and in Ames plate-incorporation assays using Escherichia coli WP2 and WP2uvrA as test organisms. The plate-incorporation assays were performed in the presence or absence of metabolic enzymes contained in the S9 liver fraction from Aroclor 1254-induced rats, to investigate whether bioactivation of the diazabenzophenanthrenes contributed to their toxicity. No differences between these two protocols were observed, with neither test showing reversion to prototrophic behaviour. Furthermore, the compounds were not toxic to the test organism. These initial results suggest that these compounds are not mutagenic in the Ames tests employed.","Is 5,8-diazabenzo[c]phenanthrenes mutagenic for WP2uvrA strain?",False
879,"The focus of this research was to develop a better understanding of the pertinent physico-chemical properties of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) that affect genotoxicity, specifically how cellular uptake influences a genotoxic cell response. The genotoxicity of AgNPs was assessed for three potential mechanisms: mutagenicity, clastogenicity and DNA strand-break-based DNA damage. Mutagenicity (reverse mutation assay) was assessed in five bacterial strains of Salmonella typhimurium and Echerichia coli, including TA102 that is sensitive to oxidative DNA damage. AgNPs of all sizes tested (10, 20, 50 and 100nm), along with silver nitrate (AgNO3), were negative for mutagenicity in bacteria. No AgNPs could be identified within the bacteria cells using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), indicating these bacteria lack the ability to actively uptake AgNPs 10nm or larger. Clastogenicity (flow cytometry-based micronucleus assay) and intermediate DNA damage (DNA strand breaks as measured in the Comet assay) were assessed in two mammalian white blood cell lines: Jurkat Clone E6-1 and THP-1. It was observed that micronucleus and Comet assay end points were inversely correlated with AgNP size, with smaller NPs inducing a more genotoxic response. TEM results indicated that AgNPs were confined within intracellular vesicles of mammalian cells and did not penetrate the nucleus. The genotoxicity test results and the effect of AgNO3 controls suggest that silver ions may be the primary, and perhaps only, cause of genotoxicity. Furthermore, since AgNO3 was not mutagenic in the gram-negative bacterial Ames strains tested, the lack of bacterial uptake of the AgNPs may not be the major reason for the lack of genotoxicity observed.

880,"Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) are being used increasingly for various industrial and consumer products, including cosmetics and sunscreens because of their photoactive properties. Therefore, the toxicity of TiO2-NPs needs to be thoroughly understood. In the present study, the genotoxicity of 10nm uncoated sphere TiO2-NPs with an anatase crystalline structure, which has been well characterized in a previous study, was assessed using the Salmonella reverse mutation assay (Ames test) and the single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay. For the Ames test, Salmonella strains TA102, TA100, TA1537, TA98 and TA1535 were preincubated with eight different concentrations of the TiO2-NPs for 4 h at 37 °C, ranging from 0 to 4915.2 µg per plate. No mutation induction was found. Analyses with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed that the TiO2-NPs were not able to enter the bacterial cell. For the Comet assay, TK6 cells were treated with 0-200 µg ml(-1) TiO2-NPs for 24 h at 37 °C to detect DNA damage. Although the TK6 cells did take up TiO2-NPs, no significant induction of DNA breakage or oxidative DNA damage was observed in the treated cells using the standard alkaline Comet assay and the endonuclease III (EndoIII) and human 8-hydroxyguanine DNA-glycosylase (hOGG1)-modified Comet assay, respectively. These results suggest that TiO2-NPs are not genotoxic under the conditions of the Ames test and Comet assay.",Is TiO2-NPs mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
881,"Extensive production and consumption of nanomaterials such as ZnO and TiO(2) has increased their release and disposal into the environment. The accumulation of nanoparticles (NPs) in ecosystem is likely to pose threat to non-specific targets such as bacteria. The present study explored the effect of ZnO and TiO(2) NPs in a model bacterium, Salmonella typhimurium. The uptake of ZnO and TiO(2) bare NPs in nano range without agglomeration was observed in S. typhimurium. TEM analysis demonstrated the internalization and uniform distribution of NPs inside the cells. Flow cytometry data also demonstrates that both ZnO and TiO(2) NPs were significantly internalized in the S. typhimurium cells in a concentration dependent manner. A significant increase in uptake was observed in the S. typhimurium treated even with 8 and 80 ng mL(-1) of ZnO and TiO(2) NPs with S9 after 60 min, possibly the formation of micelles or protein coat facilitated entry of NPs. These NPs exhibited weak mutagenic potential in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA1537 and Escherichia coli (WP2uvrA) of Ames test underscoring the possible carcinogenic potential similar to certain mutagenic chemicals. Our study reiterates the need for re-evaluating environmental toxicity of ZnO and TiO(2) NPs presumably considered safe in environment.",Is NPs mutagenic for TA98 or WP2uvrA or TA1537 strain?,True
882,"37 dyes including 3 anthraquinone, 22 azo; 5 xanthene, 5 fluorandiol, and 2 thioindigo dyes, were tested for mutagenic potential with the Salmonella/mammalian-microsome test. Two frame-shift histidine mutants (TA1537 and TA98) and two base-pair substituted histidine mutants (TA1535 and TA100) of Salmonella typhimurium were employed. Both the spot test and the plate-incorporation assay indicated that one azo dye, D&C Orange No. 17, was mutagenic with three of the bacterial test strains. The mutagenic response of D&C Orange No. 17 was depressed by the addition of the microsomal fractions from rat livers. Of the chemicals used to synthesize D&C Orange No; 17 was depressed by the addition of the microsomal fractions from rat livers. Of the chemicals used to synthesize D&C Orange No. 17, beta-naphthol was not mutagenic but 2,4-dinitroaniline was mutagenic to the same Salmonella strains as D&C Orange No. 17 . Dimethyl sulfoxide extracts of lipsticks of similar formula but without D&C Orange No. 17 were tested in the plate incorporation assay. Only those containing D&C Orange No. 17 were mutagenic and the dye was mutagenic at concentrations consumed in normal daily use.",Is D&C Orange No. 17 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
883,"DCB, 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, is used primarily as an intermediate in the manufacture of diarylide yellow or azo red pigments for printing ink, textile, paint, and plastics. It is also used in tattoo inks. In this article, we investigate light-induced toxicity of DCB in both bacteria and human Jurkat T-cells. DCB itself is not toxic or mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium TA102, but is photomutagenic at concentrations as low as 2 microM and phototoxic at concentrations >100 microM when bacteria are exposed to DCB and light at the same time (1.2 J/cm2 of UVA and 2.1 J/cm2 of visible light). Furthermore, DCB is both photocytotoxic and photogenotoxic to human Jurkat T-cells. Under a light irradiation dose of 2.3 J/cm2 of UVA and 4.2 J/cm2 of visible light, it causes the Jurkat T-cells to become nonviable in a DCB dose-dependent manner and the nonviable cells reaches 60% at DCB concentrations higher than 50 microM. At the same time, DNA fragmentation is observed for cells exposed to both DCB and light, determined by single cell gel electrophoresis (alkaline comet assay). As much as 5% (average) DNA fragmentation was observed when exposed to 200 microM DCB and light irradiation. This suggests that DCB can penetrate the cell membrane and enter the cell. Upon light activation, DCB in the cells can cause various cellular damages, leading to nonviable Jurkat T-cells. It appears, the nonviable cells are not caused solely by fragmentation of cellular DNA, but by other damages such as to proteins and cell membranes, or DNA alkylation. Therefore, persons exposed to DCB through environmental contamination or through tattoo piercing using DCB-containing inks must not only concern about its toxicity without exposing to light, but also its phototoxicity.",Is DCB mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False
884,"Treatment of foods, such as red meat and poultry, that contain palmitic acid with ionizing radiation leads to the formation of 2-dodecylcyclobutanone (2-DCB), a compound found only in irradiated foods. In this study, the Salmonella mutagenicity test and the yeast DEL assay were used to evaluate the genotoxic potential of 2-DCB. Salmonella Typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 were exposed to 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg per well of 2-DCB, with and without exogenous metabolic activation (5% S9 fraction), using the microtiter plate-based Miniscreen version of the test. 2-DCB did not induce mutations in the Salmonella mutagenicity test. When Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain RS112, which contains a nonfunctional duplication of the his3 gene that can be induced to form a functional HIS3+ gene by intrachromosomal recombination, was exposed to 0.63, 1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 mg/ml of 2-DCB, no increase in the rate of intrachromosomal (DEL) recombination was observed. The absence of genotoxicity observed in this study using purified 2-DCB agrees with the lack of genotoxic and teratogenic activity observed in previously conducted multigeneration feeding studies of laboratory animals (rats, mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits) that used radiation-sterilized poultry that contained 2-DCB as a unique radiolytic product.",Is 2-DCB mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
885,"The metabolic basis of the differential activation of 4 benzidines--3,3'-dichlorobenzidine (DCB), benzidine (BZ), o-tolidine (TOL) and o-dianisidine (DIN)--to mutagens was examined in the Ames test, using Salmonella typhimurium TA98. For each benzidine congener, the comparative activation by 3 rat liver enzyme systems--(i) postmitochondrial supernatant (S9), (ii) S9 + acetylcoenzyme A (S9-Ac) and (iii) microsomes--and the effect thereon of animal pretreatment with 3 cytochrome P-450 inducers--DCB, 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) and phenobarbital (PB)--were examined. DCB was the most activated of the benzidines, with activation by the 3 systems being in the order: S9 = S9-Ac greater than microsomes, whereas dianisidine and tolidine were the least activated. Benzidine was activated only in the S9 systems but the S9-catalyzed activation of benzidine, unlike that of DCB, was enhanced by added acetylcoenzyme A. Pretreatment with either DCB, MC or PB enhanced the activation of DCB, decreased that of benzidine, and had no effect on that of tolidine or dianisidine. The enhanced DCB activation was most pronounced with DCB pretreatment and was 2.5-fold, 2-fold, and 3-fold, in S9-Ac, S9, and microsomes, respectively. The microsomal-catalyzed DCB activation was inhibited by the cytochrome P-450 inhibitors 2,4-dichloro-6-phenylphenoxyethylamine and alpha-naphthoflavone by 93% and 48%, respectively. DCB, but not its congeners, elicited NADPH-dependent metabolite complex formation with microsomal cytochrome P-450. The results show that DCB is the most mutagenic of the 4 benzidines under conditions of cytochrome-P-450-catalyzed activation and suggest that the DCB activation may be catalyzed most effectively by cytochrome P-450 species induced specifically by the compound itself.",Is DCB mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
886,"The direct and H2O2-dependent mutagenicity of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine (DCB) were compared in Salmonella tester strains TA98, TA98/1,8-DNP6, TA100 and TA102 using the Ames test. DCB exhibited both direct and H2O2-dependent mutagenicity to both tester strains TA98 and TA98/1,8-DNP6. This H2O2-dependent mutagenicity of DCB was prevented by horseradish peroxidase. DCB, in contrast to its effects in tester strains TA98, was not mutagenic to TA100 and TA102 either directly or in the presence of H2O2. These results suggest that mechanisms, perhaps enzymes endogenous to tester strains TA98, may play a role in the activation of DCB.",Is DCB mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
887,"An examination has been made of some of the parameters which can affect mutant numbers in the Salmonella/microsome assay. The type of minimal media plates used for the assay and the concentration of glucose-6-phosphate, one of the co-factors necessary for mono-oxygenase action, had no effect on mutant numbers. Increases in mutated bacteria resulted from the use of (1) log-phase bacteria, (2) higher NADP concentrations than those normally recommended, and (3) higher phosphate buffer concentrations. Six mutagens, i.e., 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF), 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine (3,3'-DCB), cyclophosphamide (CY), aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) and benzo[a]pyrene (BP), all requiring mono-oxygenase activation, were studied with two Salmonella typhimurium strains, TA98 and TA100, and liver preparations from rats given different inducing agent treatments using optimum conditions. Phenobarbitone induction was generally superior to Aroclor-1254 in converting these substrates to mutagens except for the polycyclic hydrocarbon substrates. A comparison of 3-methylcholanthrene, Aroclor-1254, beta-naphthoflavone or phenobarbitone as inducing agents revealed the first three of these to be equally effective in activating BP or 3MC to mutagens, whereas phenobarbitone was less active. Dual administration of 3-methylcholanthrene and phenobarbitone to rats did not result in an additive mutagenic effect using AAF, AFB1 or 3,3'-DCB as substrates, the numbers of mutant bacteria obtained being only equal to that seen with 3-methylcholanthrene alone. These differences were not due to there being different liver protein optima for the various inducing agent treatments. The foregoing results are discussed in relation to attempts to draw up a rigid protocol for mutagenicity testing.","Is 3,3'-DCB mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?",True
888,"A study on the relationship between mutagenic activity and chemical reactivity of a series of 2-fluorenylamino and hydroxylamino derivatives has been carried out by assaying their ability to revert the Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98. The mutagenic potency of the fluorenamides increased with increasing availability of the amidic hydrogen for abstraction and tertiary amides were quite inactive. N-Hydroxy and N-acyloxy derivatives were directly mutagenic and increased their mutagenic activity after metabolic conversion by liver S9. N-Hydroxy-2-benzoylaminofluorene, inactive without S9, after activation was the most mutagenic. Of a pair of N-acyloxy-derivatives, N-benzoyloxy-2-acetylaminofluorene, which undergoes rearrangement of the benzoyloxy group from nitrogen to ring carbons even at room temperature, was less potent than N-acetyloxy-2-acetylamino-fluorene whose rearrangement occurs at higher temperatures. Corresponding C-1 and C-3 benzoyloxy and acetyloxy derivatives were found ineffective in this assay in agreement with previous reports on the hydroxy series. N-Chloro-2-amino-(or acetylamino)fluorene were found more active than the corresponding N-hydroxy analogs in the presence of S9, thus suggesting an alternate pathway for activation, likely a direct conversion to electrophilic species. Furthermore, in contrast with inactivity of ring hydroxy and acyloxy derivatives, 3-chloro-2-acetylaminofluorene retained mutagenic activity. Finally 2,2'-azoxyfluorene, the ultimated oxidation product of N-hydroxyaminofluorene, tested in vitro and in vivo experiments, was found completely inactive.",Is N-Hydroxy-2-benzoylaminofluorene mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
889,"3-Nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO) is an energetic explosive proposed for use in weapon systems, to reduce the sensitivity of warheads. In order to develop toxicity data for safety assessment, we investigated the genotoxicity of NTO, using a battery of genotoxicity tests, which included the Ames test, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell chromosome aberration test, L5178Y TK(+/-) mouse lymphoma mutagenesis test and rat micronucleus test. NTO was not mutagenic in the Ames test or in Escherichia coli (WP2uvrA). NTO did not induce chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells, with or without metabolic activation. In the L5178Y TK(+/-) mouse lymphoma mutagenesis test, all of the NTO-treated cultures had mutant frequencies that were similar to the average frequencies of solvent control-treated cultures, indicating a negative result. Confirmatory tests for the three in vitro tests also produced negative results. The potential in vivo clastogenicity and aneugenicity of NTO was evaluated using the rat peripheral blood micronucleus test. NTO was administered by oral gavage to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats for 14 days at doses up to 2g/kg/day. Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood demonstrated no significant induction of micronucleated reticulocytes relative to the vehicle control (PEG-200). These studies reveal that NTO was not genotoxic in either in vitro or in vivo tests and suggest a low risk of genetic hazards associated with exposure.",Is NTO mutagenic for WP2uvrA strain?,False
890,An extract from  Spatholobus suberectus  ( S. suberectus ) Dunn has been reported to show potent antimutagenic effects against  N -alkyl- N -nitrosoureas in  umu  screening. The aim of this study was to identify the antimutagenic components from extracts of  S. suberectus  against  N -methyl- N -nitrosourea (MNU) in the Ames assay with  Salmonella typhimurium  strain TA1535 and to elucidate the antimutagenic mechanism of the flavonoids.,Is Spatholobus suberectus mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,False

892,"Antimutagenesis against N-nitroso compounds contribute to prevention of human cancer. We have found that Glycyrrhiza aspera ethanolic extract exhibits antimutagenic activity against N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) using the Ames assay with Salmonella typhimurium TA1535. In the present study, eight purified components from Glycyrrhiza, namely glabridin, glycyrrhetinic acid, glycyrrhizin, licochalcone A, licoricesaponin H2, licoricesaponin G2, liquiritigenin and liquiritin were evaluated for their antimutagenicity against MNU in the Ames assay with S. typhimurium TA1535. Glycyrrhetinic acid, glycyrrhizin, licoricesaponin G2, licoricesaponin H2 and liquiritin did not show the antimutagenicity against MNU in S. typhimurium TA1535. Glabridin, licochalcone A and liquiritigenin reduced revertant colonies derived from MNU in S. typhimurium TA1535 without showing cytotoxic effects, indicating that these compounds possess antimutagenic activity against MNU. The inhibitory activity of glabridin and licochalcone A was more effective than that of liquiritigenin. Thus, Glycyrrhiza contains antimutagenic components against DNA alkylating, direct-acting carcinogens.",Is glabridin mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,False
893,"Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a close association between infection with Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) and the development of gastric carcinoma. Chronic H.pylori infection increases the frequency of mutation in gastric epithelial cells. However, the mechanism by which infection of H.pylori leads to mutation in gastric epithelial cells is unclear. We suspected that components in H.pylori may be related to the mutagenic response associated with DNA alkylation, and could be detected with the Ames test using a more sensitive strain for alkylating agents. Our investigation revealed that an extract of H.pylori was mutagenic in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium YG7108, which is deficient in the DNA repair of O(6)-methylguanine. The extract of H.pylori may contain methylating or alkylating agents, which might induce O (6)-alkylguanine in DNA. Mutagenicity of the alkylating agents N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine in the Ames test with S.typhimurium TA1535 was enhanced significantly in the presence of the extract of H.pylori. The tested extracts of H.pylori resulted in a significant induction of micronuclei in human-derived lymphoblastoid cells. Heat instability and dialysis resistance of the extracts of H.pylori suggest that the mutagenic component in the extracts of H.pylori is a heat-unstable large molecule or a heat-labile small molecule strongly attached or adsorbed to a large molecule. Proteins in the extracts of H.pylori were subsequently fractionated using ammonium sulphate precipitation. However, all fractions expressed enhancing effects toward MNU mutagenicity. These results suggest the mutagenic component is a small molecule that is absorbed into proteins in the extract of H.pylori, which resist dialysis. Continuous and chronic exposure of gastric epithelial cells to the alkylative mutagenic component from H.pylori chronically infected in the stomach might be a causal factor in the gastric carcinogenesis associated with H.pylori.

894,"Mutagenic and clastogenic effects of some DNA damaging agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) have been demonstrated to exhibit a nonlinear or even ""thresholded"" dose-response in vitro and in vivo. DNA repair seems to be mainly responsible for these thresholds. To this end, we assessed several mutagenic alkylators in the Ames test with four different strains of Salmonella typhimurium: the alkyl transferases proficient strain TA1535 (Ogt+/Ada+), as well as the alkyl transferases deficient strains YG7100 (Ogt+/Ada-), YG7104 (Ogt-/Ada+) and YG7108 (Ogt-/Ada-). The known genotoxins EMS, MMS, temozolomide (TMZ), ethylnitrosourea (ENU) and methylnitrosourea (MNU) were tested in as many as 22 concentration levels. Dose-response curves were statistically fitted by the PROAST benchmark dose model and the Lutz-Lutz ""hockeystick"" model. These dose-response curves suggest efficient DNA-repair for lesions inflicted by all agents in strain TA1535. In the absence of Ogt, Ada is predominantly repairing methylations but not ethylations. It is concluded that the capacity of alkyl-transferases to successfully repair DNA lesions up to certain dose levels contributes to genotoxicity thresholds.",Is methyl methanesulfonate mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
895,"Several health benefits, including protection from tumors at various anatomic sites, such as the lungs, stomach, and prostate gland, have been attributed to tomatoes and tomato-based products. Among tomato carotenoids, lycopene is the most active antioxidant, although it has many other biological effects, but data on its antimutagenic effects are scarce and often discrepant. The aim of our work was to determine the protective effects of lycopene, with regard to mutagenicity, via two indirect mutagens/carcinogens-2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁) and the direct mutagen/carcinogen N-nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU)--using the Ames and micronucleus tests. The significant, dose-dependent, antimutagenic effects of two concentrations of lycopene (30 μg and 300 μg per plate) were demonstrated at various concentrations of both AFB₁ and IQ in two strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA98 and TA100). The protective effects of lycopene relative to MNU were lower in comparison to its protective effects relative to AFB₁ and IQ. Mice treated for 3 days with different doses of lycopene (either 25 or 50 mg/kg of body weight) prior to administration of individual mutagens resulted in a significant reduction of micronuclei numbers in the micronucleus test. Tomato purée (tested using the Ames test and AFB(1)) revealed a much stronger, dose-dependent, antimutagenic effect compared with corresponding doses of pure lycopene. Results indicate that lycopene has antimutagenic effects, although the effects are lower than that of tomato purée, which contains a complex mixture of bioactive phytochemicals. The antimutagenic effect is connected with the chemoprotective role of lycopene, tomatoes, and tomato products in the prevention of carcinogenesis.",Is MNU mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
896,"Using the Ames bacterial mutagenicity test, the comet assay, and an in vivo micronucleus test, we investigated the effect of the chemoprotective substance phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) on the mutagenic activity of indirect-acting mutagens and carcinogens aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), and direct-acting mutagen and carcinogen N-nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU). In the Ames test, the antimutagenic activity of PEITC was studied in the concentration range 0.3-300 microg/plate. PEITC at concentrations of 0.3, 3 and 30 microg/plate reduced dose-dependently mutagenicity of AFB1 and IQ in both S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains. In the case of the direct mutagen MNU, the antimutagenic effect of PEITC was detected only at concentration of 30 microg/plate in the strain TA100. The PEITC concentration 300 microg/plate was toxic in the Ames test. The 24 h pre-treatment of HepG2 cells with PEITC at concentration 0.15 microg/ml resulted in a significant decrease of DNA breaks induced by MNU at concentrations 0.25 and 0.5 mM. Although a trend towards reduced strand break level were determined also at PEITC concentrations 0.035 and 0.07 microg/ml it did not reach the statistical significance. No effect, however, of PEITC on IQ-induced DNA breaks was observed. Chemopreventive effect of PEITC was revealed also in vivo. Pretreatment of mice with PEITC concentrations of 25 and 12.5 mg/kg b.w. administered to mice in three daily doses resulted in reduction of micronucleus formation in mice exposed to all three mutagens under study, with statistically significant effect at concentration of 25 mg/kg. Results of this study indicate that the strong PEITC antimutagenic properties may have an important role in the prevention of carcinogenesis and other chronic degenerative diseases that share some common pathogenetic mechanisms.",Is PEITC mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
897,"The effects of dietary administration of diallyl sulfide (DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS) and allyl mercaptan (AM) on the genotoxicity of different chemicals were studied in two experimental systems: (i) measurement of hepatic DNA single-strand breaks induced in rats by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) or methylnitrosourea (MNU); (ii) mutagenicity of AFB1 or NDMA on Salmonella typhimurium TA100 using hepatic S9 from rats fed allyl sulfides as the activation system. All compounds strongly reduced hepatic DNA breaks induced by AFB1 and NDMA but did not modify the genotoxicity of MNU. In the Ames test, the mutagenicity of NDMA was strongly inhibited by hepatic S9 from rats fed either compound. The mutagenicity of AFB1 was also reduced but to a lesser extent. Such effects are likely related to the modulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes which play a key role in metabolic activation as well as detoxication of NDMA and AFB1.",Is diallyl sulfide mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
898,"Lijinsky and his colleagues have reported that the N',N'-dimethyl analogues of ENU and MNU [N',N'-dimethyl-N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (DMENU) and trimethylnitrosourea (TMNU), respectively] are carcinogenic to rats despite their extreme hydrolytic stability which would reduce or preclude generation of alkylating species analogous to those formed upon hydrolysis of ENU and MNU. Lijinsky and his colleagues were unable to rationalize those activities of DMENU and TMNU despite extensive experimentation. We therefore decided to study this problem further. Whichever mode is accepted for the generation of electrophilic/mutagenic/carcinogenic reactive species from ENU and MNU, blocking of the free-NH2 group with methyl groups (-NMe2) should ablate or abolish activity. Consistent with this DMENU and TMNU gave negative results in the NBP alkylation test while the parent compounds gave an instantaneous deep blue coloration. Studies of the rate of hydrolysis of these four compounds revealed ENU and MNU to have half-lives of 8 min, while the alkylated analogues (DMENU and TMNU) had half-lives of 25 and 41 days, respectively. Hydrolysis of ENU and MNU, to yield the alkylating species, proceeds either via proton abstraction from the -NH2 group or by attack by water on the carbon of the carbonyl group. Methylation will inhibit both of these pathways, the first absolutely (no -NH2 protons) and the second partially, via steric inhibition. The slow hydrolysis observed for DMENU and TMNU suggests that the latter route of hydrolysis is applicable. Studies with strain TA1535 of Salmonella typhimurium (without S9 mix) confirmed the potent mutagenic activity for ENU and MNU (approximately 300-fold increase in revertants at 2,000 micrograms/plate and approximately 180-fold increase in revertants at 150 micrograms/plate respectively). In contrast, the methylated analogues showed only weak mutagenic activity (approximately 3-fold) at approximately 100-fold higher dose-levels. Addition of S9 mix did not affect the mutagenicity of DMENU or TMNU. To this point, hypothesis and data coincide. ENU and MNU are potent micronucleus-inducing agents to the mouse bone marrow, and given the above data, it was expected that DMENU and TMNU would show weak or no activity in that assay. In fact, the methylated analogues were as effective as ENU and MNU as clastogens to the mouse bone marrow. Four possible reasons for this conflict of theory and data are explored. The speculative explanation we favour for these effects is that the net alkylation of bone marrow DNA is the same for all four chemicals. With ENU and MNU, most of the alkylating activity is dissipated by rapid hydrolysis. Thus, only a small fraction of the administered dose survives to alkylate the bone marrow. Due to the enhanced stability of the methyl analogues most of the delivered dose will reach the bone marrow. However, because of their lower intrinsic reactivity, only a small fraction of the target dose will alkylate the bone marrow DNA during the time window of the experiment. If these opposing influences happen to balance out, the essentially identical bone marrow genetic toxicity for the four chemicals could be explained.",Is MNU mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
899,"The serine at the active site of beta-lactamase is responsible for the ester link to the acyl group of beta-lactam during hydrolysis of the substrate to its acid derivatives. A construct was made from a plasmid in which the active-site serine of beta-lactamase was substituted by glycine by site-directed mutation. This mutation results in the loss of beta-lactamase activity. This plasmid was used to transform Salmonella typhimurium TA1535. When the new strain JK947 was treated with a mutagen such as N-methyl-N'-nitro-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), the bacteria could be recovered as they became ampicillin resistant. The sequence of the active-site serine codon in these revertants was mutated from GGC to AGC. Based upon these findings, we developed a model reverse mutagenicity assay. In this procedure, we treated JK947 with a test chemical, such as N-methyl-nitrosourea (MNU), dimethyl sulphate (DMS) or methylmethane sulphonate (MMS), for 30 min, and then scored the revertants on agar plates containing 50 micrograms/ml ampicillin after incubation at 37 degrees C for 16 h. MNU and MNNG were more potent than DMS and MMS in this assay. Treatment with MNU and MNNG resulted in larger colony numbers in our test than in the Ames test. However, our test was less sensitive to DMS and MMS than the Ames test.",Is MNNG mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
900,"Guanazole and aphidicolin were chosen as candidates in the search for a selective, non-genotoxic inhibitor of DNA replication which could be used instead of hydroxyurea to measure DNA repair synthesis in rat hepatocyte primary cultures by liquid scintillation counting. The genotoxicity of these 3 chemicals was studied using the Salmonella/liver homogenate assay and the autoradiographic UDS test in hepatocytes. Hydroxyurea was positive in both of these assays. Guanazole and aphidicolin did not induce DNA repair in hepatocytes. Aphidicolin was not mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium, whereas guanazole increased the revertant numbers of strain TA102 slightly. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine was measured by liquid scintillation to determine DNA repair induced by 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF), aflatoxin B1, benzo[a]pyrene, cyclophosphamide, H2O2, 6-hydroxydopamine, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), methylnitrosourea (MNU), 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide and UV irradiation in the presence of either 10 mM hydroxyurea, 15 mM guanazole or 0.015 mM aphidicolin. Aphidicolin had an inhibitory effect on DNA repair. Except for the 3 chemicals mentioned below, the sensitivity of the DNA repair measurement was the same, no matter whether hydroxyurea or guanazole was used to inhibit replicative DNA synthesis. In the presence of hydroxyurea, DNA repair synthesis was found at lower concentrations in the case of aflatoxin B1, due to differences in the solvent control values, and in the case of H2O2, possibly due to a synergistic effect between hydroxyurea and H2O2. Guanazole allowed the detection of DNA repair induced by MNNG at lower concentrations, probably because of an antagonistic effect between hydroxyurea and MNNG. Based on these results, it was concluded that guanazole, but not aphidicolin, could be used instead of hydroxyurea to measure DNA repair synthesis by liquid scintillation in rat hepatocyte primary cultures. Although guanazole does not completely fulfill the criteria for an ideal DNA replication inhibitor, it has the advantage of being less genotoxic than hydroxyurea, and also appears to have a smaller potential to falsify the results by interacting with the test compounds.",Is Aphidicolin mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False
901,"The frequency of his+ revertants induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in the strain TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium was decreased by gallic and tannic acid. In weak buffer solutions, the inhibition effects of gallic acid towards MNU and MNNG mutagenicity was caused primarily by a decrease of pH in the incubation mixtures. At adjusted pH (pH 5.0 and 6.5), the antimutagenic effects are largely the result of an interaction between MNU or MNNG with phenolic acids outside the cells.",Is tannic acid mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
902,"The liquid suspension modification of the standard Salmonella mutagenicity assay employing Ames tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 and T100 was used to study the influence of potassium, sodium and calcium on the mutagenic activity of MNU and MNNG. The toxic and mutagenic activities of MNU and MNNG were better expressed when potassium-containing solution was used as a solvent. Short-term pretreatment of bacteria cells with potassium-containing solutions increased the mutagenic efficiency of both chemicals. Potassium-induced increased sensibility of S. typhimurium TA1535 to MNU was completely reversible after 20 min incubation of bacteria in a nutrient broth at 37 degrees C. The mutagenic activity of MNU was reduced after a short-term pretreatment of S. typhimurium TA1535 with a 0.9% solution of CaCl2, while NaCl did not change the mutagenic response of bacteria to MNU.",Is potassium mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
903,"It was recently reported that p-aminophenol (p-AP) induces DNA cleavage in mouse lymphoma cells, CHO cells and human lymphoblastoid cells. The mutagenicity of p-AP has not, however, been detected by reverse mutation assays. The purpose of this study was to assess the mutagenicity of p-AP by reverse mutation assay using Escherichia coli WP2uvrA/pKM101, which has a spectrum for detecting mutations different from those of other strains in the family with an AT base pair at the mutation site and has higher sensitivity to certain oxidative mutagens as compared to other strains. We found that p-AP was mutagenic to E. coli WP2uvrA/pKM101. The mutagenic activity of this compound was suppressed with the addition of dimethylsulfoxide or catalase, suggesting the involvement of active oxygen species in the mutagenic process induced by p-AP. To further elucidate the underlying mechanism, we used isolated DNA for the following experiments. It was revealed, by gel electrophoretic analysis, that p-AP induced DNA cleavage in the presence of Fe(III). However, p-AP alone did not induce this cleavage. Formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine by p-AP in calf thymus DNA was also detected in the presence of Fe(III) by HPLC with an electrochemical detector. ESR-spin trapping experiments using DMPO detected the production of hydroxyl radical (.OH) in the solution of p-AP with Fe(III). Both p-AP mediated DNA damages and .OH production by p-AP in the presence of Fe(III) were completely inhibited by .OH scavengers (ethanol, mannitol, sodium formate, dimethylsulfoxide) and catalase. These results suggest that .OH derived from the reaction between H2O2 and Fe(III) (Fenton reaction) participates in the oxidative DNA damage.

904,"3-Amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) is a group 2B carcinogen characterized by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and great efforts have been taken to reduce Trp-P-1 mutagenicity to humans. In this study, the effect of a reduction of Trp-P-1 on intestinal absorption as a promising strategy was investigated. The data showed that when 20 mM Trp-P-1 cotransported with 10 mM of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), xanthan gum, or carrageenan, the absorption rate of Trp-P-1 was reduced by 31.5%, 49.5%, or 72.9% in MDCK-MDR1 cell monolayer, respectively; and 64.6%, 83.4%, or 64.1% in rat intestinal tissues, correspondingly. These 3 polysaccharides also reduced pharmacokinetic parameters, that is, C max  , AUC 0-t  , and AUC 0-∞  , after Trp-P-1 was given to rats intragastrically. However, gum arabic did not exhibit similar effects on Trp-P-1 absorption in vitro or in vivo. The Ames test showed that these 3 polysaccharides reduced Trp-P-1 mutagenicity to Salmonella typhimurium TA98, but gum arabic did not. Isothermal titration calorimetry assay indicated that Trp-P-1 interacted with these 3 polysaccharides. Thermodynamic study showed that the actual value of △H <0, but its absolute value greater than the corresponding value of T∆S, suggest a specific interaction between Trp-P-1 and these 3 polysaccharides, probably through the hydrogen bond and/or ion interaction. Reduction of Trp-P-1 intestinal absorption using food additives could be one of the strategies to suppress Trp-P-1-induced carcinogenesis in human.",Is Trp-P-1 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
905,"Airborne particulate matter has recently been classified by the IARC as carcinogenic to humans (group 1). However, the link between PM chemical composition and its carcinogenicity is still unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate and to compare genotoxic potencies of 6 native PM samples collected in spring-summer or autumn-winter, either in industrial, urban or rural area. We evaluated their mutagenicity through Ames test on YG1041, TA98, and TA102 tester strains, and their clastogenicity on human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells using comet assay, γ-H2AX quantification, and micronucleus assay. Ames test results showed a strong positive response, presumably associated with nitro-aromatics content. In addition, at least 2 positive responses were observed out of the 3 genotoxicity assays for each of the 6 samples, demonstrating their clastogenicity. Our data suggest that PM samples collected in autumn-winter season are more genotoxic than those collected in spring-summer, potentially because of higher concentrations of adsorbed organic compounds. Taken together, our results showed the mutagenicity and clastogenicity of native PM₂.₅ samples from different origins, and bring additional elements to explain the newly recognized carcinogenicity of outdoor air pollution.",Is Airborne particulate matter mutagenic for TA98 or TA102 strain?,True

To demonstrate that PCB 209 is not likely to exhibit human health hazards common to coplanar PCBs it was tested for cytochrome P450 (P450) enzyme induction potentials, genetic toxicity, and endocrine-modulating activity. PCB 209 (dose from 0.005 to 5000 ng/mL) did not significantly induce P450 CYP1A, 2A, 2B, 3A, or 4A enzyme activities in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. In contrast, Aroclor 1260, a PCB mixture that contains approximately 60% chlorine by weight, showed significant induction of P450 CYP1A, 2A, 2B, and 3A within the same dose range. PCB 209 (dose from 100 to 5000 microg/plate) was negative in the bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) test in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537 or in Eschericia coli strain WP2uvrA. PCB 209 (dose from 25 to 150 microg/mL) was also negative for forward mutations at the thymidine kinase (TK+/-) locus of L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells. The Ames and the mouse lymphoma assays were both conducted in the absence and presence of rat liver S9 fraction. PCB 209 (dose from 500 to 2000 mg/kg by single dose oral gavage) did not induce an increase in the frequency of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes in mouse bone marrow in vivo. PCB 209 did not induce estrogenic effects when administered by gavage to ovariectomized adult female rats at 500 and 1000 mg/kg for 4 days, nor did it produce alterations consistent with endocrine-modulating activity in adult intact male rats when administered by gavage at 500 and 1000 mg/kg for 15 consecutive days.",Is PCB 209 mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or WP2uvrA or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
907,"As the use of recycled materials and industrial by-products in asphalt mixtures is increasing, we investigated if recycled additives modify the genotoxicity of fumes emitted from asphalt. Fumes were generated in the laboratory at paving temperature from stone-mastic asphalt (SMA) and from SMA modified with waste plastic (90% polyethylene, 10% polypropylene) and tall oil pitch (SMA-WPT). In addition, fumes from SMA, SMA-WPT, asphalt concrete (AC), and AC modified with waste plastic and tall oil pitch (AC-WPT) were collected at paving sites. The genotoxicity of the fumes was studied by analysis of DNA damage (measured in the comet assay) and micronucleus formation in human bronchial epithelial BEAS 2B cells in vitro and by counting mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and YG1024. DNA damage was also assessed in buccal leukocytes from road pavers before and after working with SMA, SMA-WPT, AC, and AC-WPT. The chemical composition of the emissions was analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The SMA-WPT fume generated in the laboratory induced a clear increase in DNA damage in BEAS 2B cells without metabolic activation. The laboratory-generated SMA fume increased the frequency of micronucleated BEAS 2B cells without metabolic activation. None of the asphalt fumes collected at the paving sites produced DNA damage with or without metabolic activation. Fumes from SMA and SMA-WPT from the paving sites increased micronucleus frequency without metabolic activation. None of the asphalt fumes studied showed mutagenic activity in Salmonella. No statistically significant differences in DNA damage in buccal leukocytes were detected between the pre- and post-shift samples collected from the road pavers. However, a positive correlation was found between DNA damage and the urinary metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) after work shift, which suggested an association between occupational exposures during road paving and genotoxic effects. Our results indicate that fumes from SMA and SMA-WPT contain direct-acting genotoxic components.",Is asphalt fumes mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
908,"22 arylmethane dyes which have been used as food colours, commercial dyes, laboratory stains and pH indicators were tested in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity assay. 8 mutagenic dyes were identified, including 5 food colours and 3 common laboratory strains; none of the 11 indicator dyes tested was mutagenic. The commercial and laboratory dyes Methyl Violet 2B C.I. 42535 and Crystal Violet C.I. 42555 were mutagenic in base-pair substitution mutation detector strain TA1535 in the absence of metabolic activation.

Most of these compounds gave weak mutagenic responses with Salmonella and were positive only within narrow dose ranges. Since conflicting results were obtained using dyes from different sources, minor dye components may have been responsible for their mutagenicity.

At present, there is little information about the genotoxicity of TCC. In this study, we used a battery of genotoxicity testing methods including salmonella reverse mutation test (Ames test), comet assay and micronucleus assay to detect the effects of TCC on gene mutation, DNA breakage, and chromosome damage. The results of Ames test showed that TCC at 0.1-1000 μg/plate did not significantly increase the number of revertant colonies in the four standard Salmonella typhimurium strains, i.e., TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA102, when compared to the vehicle control. The results from comet assay demonstrated that exposure to 5, 10, or 15 μM TCC for 24 h did not significantly increase the percentage of comet cells, tail length (TL), DNA in tail (T DNA%), or olive tail moment (OTM) in keratinocyte HaCaT and hepatic L02 cells. Moreover, TCC did not markedly enhance the frequency of micronucleated cells or micronuclei in HaCaT and L02 cells in the micronucleus assay.

In 2007, twenty-seven natural latex gloves including sterile gloves, examination gloves and household use gloves were sampled from the Chinese market. This study monitored the migration of nitrosamines and nitrosatable substance from these gloves, and evaluated their mutagenicity using a Salmonella typhimurium mutation assay (Ames assay) with the strains TA98, TA97, TA100 and TA102 and by a micronucleus test (MN test) using ICR mice. In addition, the cytotoxicity of these compounds was determined by a MTT assay. N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) and N-nitrosodibutylamine (NDBA) were all found in samples treated with artificial sweat for 4h at 37 degrees C, and total nitrosamines varied from 18.89 to 244.51microg/Kg. The nitrosamine mixture of NDMA, NDEA and NDBA was used in both the Ames assay and the MN test. The proportion of NDMA, NDEA and NDBA (1:10:20) was selected according to the proportion of nitrosamines migration from sample E05. In the Ames assay, the lowest dose (1.98 x 10(-3)microg per plate) produced a positive result in the TA98 strain, corresponding to nitrosamines migration from sample E05 of 0.016g (the total nitrosamines migration from glove E05 was 122.55 microg/kg). The TA100 strain responded positively at a dose of 4.96 x 10(-2)microg per plate, corresponding to nitrosamines migration from glove E05 of 0.040g. The MN test showed nitrosamine migration of 3.04 mg from 2066 pairs of sample E05 and could induce micronuclei in one mouse weighing 28g (average weight of one E05 glove was 6g). Extracts from gloves were found to be cytotoxic and there was a significant correlation between cytotoxicity (IC50) and the release level of nitrosamines.

In order to characterize this induction we tested the capacity of liver S9 from rats orally treated with cyclohexanol for 5 days, to activate several carcinogenic nitrosamines into mutagens in the Salmonella typhimurium TA100 test system. Additionally, Western blot analysis of hepatic microsomes from the same treated animals were analysed with specific antibodies against P450 protein families 1A1/A2, 2B1/B2 and 2E1. Cyclohexanol-S9 mixture was more efficient in activating the following nitrosamines: N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodipropylamine (NDPA), N-nitrosomethylpropylamine (NMPA), N-nitrosodibutylamine (NDBA), and N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) into bacterial mutagens than S9 from non-treated animals. The mutagenicity of N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) was not modified in the presence of S9 from cyclohexanol-treated animals. Since the main metabolic pathway leading to the production of mutagenic intermediates of NDMA and NPYR is catalysed by isozyme CYP2E1 and that of NDPA, NMPA and NDBA by CYP2B1/B2, mutagenicity experiments predicted that cyclohexanol induces these two P450 isozyme families. Western blot analysis confirmed the results of the mutagenicity assay, showing an increase in the intensity of CYP2E1 and CYP2B1/B2 protein bands in hepatic microsomes from cyclohexanol treated rats in comparison with non-treated controls.

The H2O2-oxidized m-PD/p-PD and o-PD/p-PD were potent mutagens with S9 mix, whereas H2O2-oxidized p-PD was slightly mutagenic. The major mutagenic oxidation products of m-PD/p-PD and o-PD/p-PD were identified as 2,7- and 2,3-diaminophenazine, respectively, by TLC and HPLC. 2,8-Diaminophenazine was also found as a reaction product in oxidized m-PD/p-PD, and it was weakly mutagenic. The mutagenic potency of oxidized m-PD/p-PD or o-PD/p-PD was lower than that of singly oxidized m-PD or o-PD. The yield of 2,7- and 2,3-diaminophenazine was obviously decreased with increases in p-PD, and it was concluded that the declined mutagenic potency of oxidized m-PD/p-PD or o-PD/p-PD was due to the decrease in diaminophenazines.

Exposures to 1,1,1-trichloroethane (methyl chloroform) or 1,1,2-trichloroethylene samples which contained stabilizers resulted in increased recovery of revertant colonies of Salmonella at concentrations causing greater than 96% cell killing. However, these stabilized materials did not induce DNA repair and low-stabilized trichloroethylene did not induce reversion mutation or DNA repair. Exposure of Salmonella tester strains and hepatocytes to highly toxic vapor concentrations of technical grade 1,1,2,2-tetrochloroethylene, low-stabilized and stabilized, increased reversion mutation and elicited DNA repair. Tetrachloroethylene of high purity was not genotoxic. With all of these test products, the presence of an Aroclor-induced rat liver subcellular enzyme preparation in the mutagenesis assay did not have any effect on the results. These observations suggest that stabilizers or unknown impurities normally present at low concentrations in these products are responsible for the positive responses observed at the high exposure concentrations achievable under in vitro test conditions.",Is Tetrachloroethylene mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
925,"The standardized P2Et extract obtained from  Caesalpinia spinosa  has shown antioxidant, and direct antitumor activity, but also activation of specific immune response through the induction of tumor immunogenic cell death in breast and melanoma cancer models. The present work evaluated the mutagenicity and genotoxicity profile of P2Et to continue the development of the P2Et. Genotoxicity was evaluated by OECD 1997 a guideline and mutagenicity by OECD 2016. At P2Et's doses of 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg body weight in mice ( Mus musculus ), the difference between the number of micronuclei in PCE of the groups were not statistically significant (17 (negative control), 15 (500 mg/kg), 15 (1000 mg/kg), 19 (2000 mg/kg) and 271 (positive control). Similarly, P2Et did not induce gene mutations by base pair changes or frameshifts in the genome of  Salmonella Typhimurium  strains TA98, TA100, TA102, TA1535 and TA1537 at the tested range of concentrations up to 5000 μg/plate in the absence and presence of metabolic activation. Therefore, the P2Et was considered as non- mutagenic and non-genotoxic at the conditions of the tests.",Is P2Et mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
926,"As di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), one of phthalates, is classified as probable human carcinogens in EPA, acetyltriethyl citrate(ATEC), one of aliphatic esters, could be applied to DEHP substitute. ATEC is used as plasticizers in cosmetics and nail products. Here, we studied whether ATEC might have genotoxic potential and induce glucose tolerance as compared to DEHP. Genotoxicity was determined by Ames test with histidine-requiring Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537) and tryptophan-requiring Escherichia coli (WP2uvrA(pKM101)) strains, chromosomal aberration assay with Chinese hamster lung(CHL/IU) cells, and micronucleus test with bone marrow cells of CD-1 mice. The number of revertants was not significantly changed in Ames test. The frequency of cells with chromosome aberrations was less than 5% in ATEC- or DEHP-treated cells for 6 or 24 h. In addition, no statistically significant increase was observed for the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE) in polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) and for the ratio of PCE among total erythrocytes at 24 or 48 h after the treatment of mice with ATEC or DEHP. In the meanwhile, blood glucose level (BGL) was increased by the treatment of mice with DEHP or ATEC for 5 consecutive days. Additional 7 days later, BGL by DEHP was recovered to normal level, but not that by ATEC. Then, taken together, our results suggest that ATEC could disrupt glucose metabolism under our experimental conditions. Therefore, although DEHP and ATEC may not be genotoxic, our data should be helpful for persons with the problem in glucose metabolism to choose products containing DEHP or ATEC.",Is DEHP mutagenic for pKM101 or TA100 or TA1535 or WP2uvrA or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
927,"DON (6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine), a glutamine antagonist, was demonstrated to exhibit analgesic, antibacterial, antiviral and anticancer properties. The study was performed to characterize its in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity potential. DON was tested in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) using Salmonella typhimurium tester strains (TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537) and Escherichia coli tester strain (WP2 uvrA) with and without S9 and also with reductive S9. In addition, DON was tested for the chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with or without S9 to evaluate the clastogenic potential. Furthermore, DON was also evaluated for its in vivo clastogenic activity by detecting micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocyte (PCE) cells in bone marrow collected from the male mice dosed intravenously with 500, 100, 10, 1 and 0.1 mg/kg at 24 and 48-h post-dose. The Ames mutagenicity assay showed no positive mutagenic responses. However, the in vitro chromosome aberration assay demonstrated dose dependent statistically positive increase in structural aberrations at 4 and 20-h exposure without S9 and also at 4-h exposure with S9. The in vivo micronucleus assay also revealed a statistically positive response for micronucleus formation at 500, 100 and 10 mg/kg at 24 and 48-h post-dose. Thus, DON appears to be negative in the Ames test but positive in the in vitro chromosome aberration assay and in the in vivo micronucleus assay. In conclusion, the results indicate DON is a genotoxic compound with a plausible epigenetic mechanism.",Is DON mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
928,"Chalcones present several biological activities and sulfonamide chalcone derivatives have shown important biological applications, including antitumor activity. In this study, genotoxic, cytotoxic, antigenotoxic, and anticytotoxic activities of the sulfonamide chalcone N-{4-[3-(4-nitrophenyl)prop-2-enoyl]phenyl} benzenesulfonamide (CPN) were assessed using the Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation test (Ames test) and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. The results showed that CPN caused a small increase in the number of histidine revertant colonies in S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100, but not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The antimutagenicity test showed that CPN significantly decreased the number of His+ revertants in strain TA98 at all doses tested (p < 0.05), whereas in strain TA100 this occurred only at doses higher than 50 μg/plate (p < 0.05). The results of the micronucleus test indicated that CPN significantly increased the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE) at 24 h and 48 h, revealing a genotoxic effect of this compound. Also, a significant decrease in polychromatic/normochromatic erythrocyte ratio (PCE/NCE) was observed at the higher doses of CPN at 24 h and 48 h (p < 0.05), indicating its cytotoxic action. CPN co-administered with mitomycin C (MMC) significantly decreased the frequency of MNPCE at almost all doses tested at 24 h (p < 0.05), showing its antigenotoxic activity, and also presented a small decrease in MNPCE at 48 h (p > 0.05). Additionally, CPN co-administered with MMC significantly increased PCE/NCE ratio at all doses tested, demonstrating its anticytotoxic effect. In summary, CPN presented genotoxic, cytotoxic, antigenotoxic, and anticytotoxic properties. ",Is CPN mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
929,"Lafoensia pacari (Lythraceae), popularly known in Brazil as ""pacari"", is a small tree native to the Cerrado that is used in folk medicine to treat cancer and as an anti-inflammatory and cicatrizing agent. We evaluated the genotoxic, cytotoxic, antigenotoxic, and anticytotoxic activities of an ethanol extract of L. pacari stem bark (EESB) using the Ames test and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. In the Ames test, EESB did not significantly increase the number of His(+) revertants in Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98 and TA100 at all doses, demonstrating lack of mutagenicity. Only the highest dose of EESB significantly increased the micronucleated polychromatic erythrocyte frequency in the micronucleus test, indicating mild genotoxicity. EESB produced a mutagenic index lower than the negative control in the Ames test. In the micronucleus test, at all doses, EESB caused a significant decrease in the polychromatic/normochromatic erythrocyte ratio (PCE/NCE) at 24 h compared with the negative control. EESB co-administered together with the respective positive control caused a significant decrease in the number of His(+) revertant colonies in the Ames test and in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the micronucleus test, demonstrating a DNA protector effect. EESB co-administered with mitomycin C significantly increased the PCE/NCE ratio at all doses, showing an anticytotoxic effect. We conclude that EESB has antigenotoxic and anticytotoxic properties.

930,"The genotoxic and mutagenic effects of two commonly used organochlorine pesticides, lindane (LND) and endosulfan (ENS), and two commonly used organophosphate pesticides, chlorpyrifos (CPF) and monocrotophos (MCP) were assessed using in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test and in vitro Ames Salmonella/ microsome mutagenicity test. The results showed that these pesticides alone or in combination, induced significantly high frequency of micronuclei (MN) formation that increased with concentration of pesticides. All these four pesticides produced significant increase in the frequencies of micronucleated-polychromatic erythrocytes (MN-PCE) and decrease infrequencies of PCE in dose-dependent manner. The results indicate the suppression of proliferative activity of the bone marrow and increase in the extent of cell death. ENS and MCP showed mutagenic potential in Salmonella/ microsome assay. ENS induced mutagenic and nontoxic response only in TA98 tester strain of S.typhimurium at the dose of 500 μg/plate and in the absence of metabolic activation. MCP showed weak mutagenic and nontoxic effect only in TA100 tester strain at the dose of 5000 μg/plate in both assays, with or without metabolic activation when compared with negative control. MCP was toxic in TA98 tester strain at the dose of 5000 μg/plate in absence of metabolic activation while reduction in toxicity was seen on addition of S9 mixture. The study clearly showed the genotoxic potential of all these four pesticides and mutagenic response of endosulfan and monocrotophos.",Is ENS mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
931,"Mangifera indica L. extract (Vimang) consists of a defined mixture of components (polyphenols, terpenoids, steroids, fatty acids and microelements). It contains a variety of polyphenols, phenolic esters, flavan-3-ols and a xanthone (mangiferin), as main component. This extract has antioxidant action, antitumor and immunemodulatory effects proved in experimental models in both in vitro and in vivo assays. The present study was performed to investigate the genotoxicity potential activity of Vimang assessed through different tests: Ames, Comet and micronucleus assays. Positive and negative controls were included in each experimental series. Histidine requiring mutants of Salmonella typhimurium TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98, TA100 and TA102 strains for point-mutation tests and in vitro micronucleus assay in primary human lymphocytes with and without metabolic activation were performed. In addition, genotoxic effects were evaluated on blood peripheral lymphocytes of NMRI mice of both sexes, which were treated during 2 days with intraperitoneal doses of M. indica L. extract (50-150 mg/kg). The observed results permitted to affirm that Vimang (200-5,000 microg/plate) did not increase the frequency of reverse mutations in the Ames test in presence or not of metabolic activation. Results of Comet assay showed that the extract did not induce single strand breaks or alkali-labile sites on blood peripheral lymphocytes of treated animals compared with controls. On the other hand, the results of the micronucleus studies (in vitro and in vivo) showed Vimang induces cytotoxic activity, determined as cell viability or PCE/NCE ratio, but neither increased the frequency of micronucleated binucleate cells in culture of human lymphocytes nor in mice bone marrow cells under our experimental conditions. The positive control chemicals included in each experiment induced the expected changes. The present results indicate that M. indica L. extract showed evidences of light cytotoxic activity but did not induce a mutagenic or genotoxic effects in the battery of assays used.",Is Vimang mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
932,"AQ-13 ([N1-(7-chloro-quinolin-4yl)-3-(N3,N3-diethylamino)propylamine] dihydrochloride trihydrate) is an aminoquinoline antimalarial drug that is effective against chloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. It is structurally similar to the widely used chloroquine diphosphate (CQ). We evaluated these drugs in the three assays currently recommended by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH): bacterial mutagenesis in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, mammalian cell mutagenesis in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and micronucleus induction in rat bone marrow. A small but statistically significant increase in revertant colonies was produced by CQ with Salmonella tester strain TA98 without metabolic activation (MA) and by AQ-13 with strain TA1537 both with and without MA. In L5178Y cells, testing of CQ and AQ-13 up to cytotoxic concentrations with and without MA produced no increase in mutant colonies and no increase in the numbers of small colonies. Slight decreases in the ratio of polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) to red blood cells (RBC) were observed in male and female rats treated with CQ and in females only treated with AQ-13; however, none of these changes was statistically significant. No increases in the frequency of micronucleated PCE were observed at any dose level of CQ or AQ-13. Although both CQ and AQ-13 showed weak bacterial mutagenicity, this mutagenic effect was not confirmed in either the mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay or the micronucleus assay. These results indicate that CQ and AQ-13 should pose minimal risk of genotoxic damage in human populations being administered these drugs.",Is CQ mutagenic for TA98 or TA1537 strain?,True
933,"The mutagenicity of diesel exhaust particles (DEP) was studied by using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 in vitro and mice micronucleus in vivo test. DEP from six kinds of medium and heavy-duty diesel vehicles, which were made in China and imported, were tested. The vehicles were operated under free accelerating condition. The results showed that the DEP contained mutagenic activity. An increase in the number of the Salmonella TA98 was observed in the presence and especially in the absence of S9 mix. Positive results were also obtained from mice micronucleus assay. The frequency of mice bone marrow micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (M PCE) was increased and it showed a definite dose-response relationship. Comparing the different types of the vehicles, we found that the mutagenicity of DEP from domestic made vehicles was stronger than that from the imported ones.",Is DEP mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
934,"N,N-diethylphenylacetamide (DEPA), a promising new insect repellent, was tested for mutagenicity in the in vitro Ames Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. For the Ames test, DEPA was assayed both in the presence and absence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat-liver S-9 mix (5 and 20% S-9 fraction), using five tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium--TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102 and TA104. For the micronucleus test, mice were exposed to DEPA through ip injection for 2 and 5 days in separate experiments, and bone marrow and peripheral blood were sampled 6 and 48 hr after the final injection, respectively. DEPA did not induce a mutagenic response in the Ames test, and mouse bone marrow and peripheral blood micronucleus tests. DEPA was not considered cytotoxic, as a depression of the percentage PCE was not observed at any dose in the range of 1 to 100 mg/kg body weight with either treatment protocol of the micronucleus test.",Is DEPA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
935,"Employing the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay it was established that the mutagenic effect of tobacco smoke (TS) (240 cm3 in a 16-l glass chamber, at 1 min or 5 min exposure time) in S. typhimurium TA98 depended on the type of S9 mix used. Addition of S9 mix obtained from the liver of 3-methylcholanthrene- or Aroclor-1254-pretreated rats but not from the liver of phenobarbital-pretreated or untreated rats was required to demonstrate the mutagenic activity of TS. One might suggest that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were involved in TS-induced mutagenesis in S. typhimurium TA98. In addition, treatment of BDF1 mice with TS (600 cm3 TS in a 14-l glass chamber, 2-6 exposures of 30 min each with a 1-min interval between them during which a total change of the air was made) caused an up to 3.5-fold increase of the number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) in mouse bone marrow detected 24 h after the TS exposure. Furthermore, a stable 2-5-fold elevation of the number of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes (NCE) was detected in the peripheral blood of mice treated daily (2 x 30 min) with TS, starting 48 h after the first TS exposure. The application of the micronucleus test in mouse peripheral blood, a more convenient and useful approach for detecting the chronic clastogenic activity of TS, allowed us to establish the cumulative genotoxic effect of TS in mice.",Is TS mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
936,"The genotoxic effect of whole tobacco smoke was studied employing the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay, the micronucleus test in mouse bone marrow and UDS in peripheral human lymphocytes. It was established that tobacco smoke (120-480 cm3 in a 16-1 glass chamber, at 1-10 min exposure time) induced a 3-9-fold increase of spontaneous his+ reversion mutation rate in S. typhimurium TA98, but not in strains TA97a, TA100 and TA102. Addition of S9 mix obtained from the liver of Aroclor 1254-treated rats was necessary to reveal the mutagenic activity of tobacco smoke. Treatment of BDF1 mice placed in a 14-1 glass chamber with tobacco smoke (600 cm3 smoke, 2 exposures of 30 min each, with a 1-min interval between them) caused a 2-fold dose-dependent elevation of the number of micronucleated PCE in bone marrow. No cumulative effect was detected when mice were treated with tobacco smoke during 2-28 consecutive days. The effect observed 24 h after tobacco-smoke exposure was abolished 48 h later. Tobacco smoke (180 or 360 cm3) passed through the culture medium (with or without S9 mix) of human peripheral lymphocytes (the cells were then incubated for 60 min at 37 degrees C) did not increase the spontaneous rate of UDS. Both the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay employing S. typhimurium TA98 strain and the micronucleus test in mouse bone marrow might be useful in studying tobacco smoke-induced mutagenesis.",Is tobacco smoke mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
937,"3,3',4,4'-Tetrachloroazoxybenzene is not commercially manufactured but is present as a contaminant of 3,4-dichloroaniline and its herbicidal derivative Diuron(R). In addition, environmental contamination occurs when 3,3',4,4'-tetrachloroazoxybenzene is formed by the photolysis and biolysis of 3,4-dichloroaniline. 3,3',4,4'-Tetrachloroazoxybenzene was nominated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for toxicity testing based on concerns over the potential for human exposure, the structural resemblance to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and the reported dioxin-like effects of 3,3',4,4'-tetrachloroazoxybenzene. The toxicity of 3,3',4,4'-tetrachloroazoxybenzene was evaluated in 16-day and 13-week gavage studies in male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. In addition to histopathology, evaluations included hematology (rats only), clinical chemistry, thyroid hormone analyses (rats only), hepatic cell proliferation (rats only), cytochrome P(450)1A immunohistological staining in the liver (rats only), and assessments of male reproductive endpoints and estrous cycle length. Additional genetic toxicology studies included mutagenicity tests in Salmonella typhimurium and the determination of micronuclei in mouse bone marrow and peripheral blood erythrocytes. In the 16-day studies, groups of five male and five female rats received 3,3',4,4'-tetrachloroazoxybenzene in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 12.5, 32, 80, 200, or 500 mg per kg body weight, 5 days a week. Groups of five male and five female mice received 0, 1, 3.2, 10, 32, or 100 mg/kg in corn oil by gavage, 5 days a week. Major effects in rats included increases in liver and lung weights, and decreases in mean body weights and body weight gains, heart weights, and thymus weights. Effects in mice included increases in liver weights and decreases in thymus weights. No effects on survival were observed. Treatment-related lesions included cytoplasmic alteration of hepatocytes, splenic hematopoietic cell proliferation, thymic atrophy, and nephropathy in rats and thymic atrophy, splenic hematopoietic cell proliferation, and hepatic foci of inflammation and necrosis in mice. In the 13-week studies, groups of 10 male and 10 female rats and mice received 3,3',4,4'- tetrachloroazoxybenzene in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 0.1, 1, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg, 5 days a week. In the 13-week rat study, all males and seven females in the 30 mg/kg groups died. Decreases in final mean body weights and body weight gains were observed in 3 and 10 mg/kg males and 10 and 30 mg/kg females. Decreased thymus weights, accompanied by thymic atrophy observed microscopically, were observed at doses of 1 mg/kg or greater in males and females. Increased liver weights were observed in males and females administered 1 mg/kg or greater, and hepatic cytochrome P(450)1A staining was increased in 1 and 3 mg/kg males and 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg females. In addition, a responsive anemia and decreases in platelet counts were observed in dosed male and female rats. A marked decrease in circulating thyroxine concentrations was observed in dosed males and females. In spite of this sharp decrease, thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations were marginally increased. A decrease in epididymal spermatozoal motility was observed in all dosed groups tested. In 10 mg/kg females, the estrous cycle length was increased. Major effects included increased incidences of hyperplasia of the forestomach in 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg males and 10 and 30 mg/kg females. Increased incidences of centrilobular degeneration and hematopoietic cell proliferation were observed in the liver of dosed males and females. Furthermore, chronic active inflammation of the lung vasculature and hematopoietic cell proliferation in the spleen were observed in dosed males and females. The increased severities of cardiomyopathy and nephropathy in males and the incidences of cardiomyopathy and nephropathy and severity of cardiomyopathy in females were 3,3',4,4'-tetrachloroazoxybenzene related. In the 13-week mouse study, the major effects included increases in liver weights in males administered 3 mg/kg or greater and females administered 1 mg/kg or greater. Hyperplasia of the forestomach and dilatation of hair follicles were observed in 10 and 30 mg/kg males and 30 mg/kg females. Furthermore, thymus weights were decreased in males administered 3 mg/kg or greater and in 10 and 30 mg/kg females. Increased incidences of centrilobular hypertrophy of hepatocytes were observed in 10 and 30 mg/kg males and females. Increased incidences of hematopoietic cell proliferation in the spleen were observed in 30 mg/kg males and in 10 and 30 mg/kg females. Increases in the incidences of thymocyte necrosis were observed in 10 mg/kg males and in 10 and 30 mg/kg females. The incidences of splenic pigmentation were increased in all dosed groups of males, and the severity of pigmentation increased with increasing dose in males and females. 3,3',4,4'-Tetrachloroazoxybenzene was not mutagenic in S. typhimurium strain TA97, TA98, TA100, or TA1535 with or without induced S9 metabolic activation enzymes. It did not induce significant increases in micronucleated erythrocytes in a three-exposure male mouse bone marrow micronucleus test up to dose levels of 200 mg/kg, but results of a 13-week peripheral blood micronucleus test conducted in male and female mice were positive. In summary, 3,3',4,4'-tetrachloroazoxybenzene caused typical dioxin-like effects, including thymic atrophy, increased liver weights, induction of hepatic cytochrome P(450)1A, and decreased mean body weight gains. Furthermore, a marked decrease in circulating thyroxine concentrations was observed in male and female rats, even at the lowest dose (0.1 mg/kg) in female rats. A decrease in epididymal sperm motility was observed at all doses in rats. Effects on the hematopoietic system occurred at doses including and lower than those that caused histopathologic alterations in the liver. A no-observable-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was not reached in rats. In male and female mice, the NOAEL was 1 and 0.1 mg/kg, respectively. Furthermore, treatment-related effects included increased incidences of hyperplasia of the forestomach epithelium in rats and mice, chronic active inflammation of the vasculature of the lung in rats, increased incidences and/or severities of cardiomyopathy and nephropathy in rats, and dilatation of the hair follicles in mice. Comparison of various dioxin-like effects in these studies with those reported in the literature indicate that 3,3',4,4'- tetrachloroazoxybenzene is six to two orders of magnitude less potent than 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.","Is 3,3',4,4'-Tetrachloroazoxybenzene mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?",False

The antimutagenicity of the fractions was tested against mutagens viz. S9-independent, namely 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (TA98) and sodium azide (TA100) and S9-dependent, 2-AF (2-aminofluorene). Among the tested fractions, CaLE fraction showed a potent efficacy with an inhibition percentage of 85.57% (TA98) and 89.93% (TA100) against the mutagenicity induced by 2-aminofluorene. The CaLE fraction could significantly scavenge free radicals in various assays, namely DPPH, lipid peroxidation inhibition, and superoxide anion radical scavenging assays with an IC 50  of 12.80, 144, and 257.3 μg/ml respectively. The antiproliferative potential of the effective CaLE fraction was assessed using MTT assay against HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells with GI 50  value of 243.4 and 324.6 μg/ml respectively. The fraction exhibited remarkable apoptosis-inducing effects through the externalization of phosphatidylserine in HeLa cells as analyzed by annexin V-FITC/PI double staining assay.

940,"Acylfulvenes are a class of antitumor agents derived from illudin S, a sesquiterpenoid toxin isolated from mushrooms of the genus Omphalotus. Although DNA appears to be their major target, no data concerning mutagenicity of acylfulvenes are available in the literature, and limited data have been published on illudin S. Enzyme-mediated biotransformations have been demonstrated to influence the cytotoxicity of acylfulvenes. Illudin S and some acylfulvenes [e.g., (-)-6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (HMAF)] are allylic alcohols with potential for enhanced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity by means of metabolic sulfation. Therefore, we studied the influence of various heterologously expressed human sulfotransferases (SULTs) on biological activities of illudin S and HMAF in bacterial and mammalian cells. (-)-Acylfulvene (AF) was tested as a congener lacking an allylic hydroxyl group. We found: (1) all three compounds were mutagenic in standard Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100 and TA104; (2) they induced gene mutations (at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase locus) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in Chinese hamster V79 cells; (3) these effects were practically unaffected when human SULTs were expressed in the target bacteria or mammalian cells (using SCE as the endpoint); (4) illudin S demonstrated 40-600 times higher genotoxic activities than the semisynthetic acylfulvenes studied; it was positive in the SCE test even at a concentration of 0.3 nM; (5) genotoxicity in mammalian cells was observed at substantially lower concentrations of the compounds than required for a positive result in the bacterial test (400 nM with illudin S). We conclude that illudin S, HMAF and AF are potent genotoxicants and human SULTs do not play a significant role in their bioactivation. ",Is AF mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

The concentrations used for this test compound were 100, 200 and 400 µg per plate.  Viscum album L. var. coloratum agglutinin showed moderate, but not negligible, protective effects regarding the antimutagenic properties against the direct-acting mutagens NaN(3) and AF-2. Furthermore, VCA was more effective in preventing the mutagenicity of the indirect-acting mutagen 2-AA (in the presence of S9) when tested with both TA98 and TA100. In conclusion, this report has shown broad ranging antimutagenic effects of VCA to numerous mutagens in TA98 and TA100 Salmonella typhimurium strains. Although the data presented here cannot be applied in vivo, they can support other antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic findings for VCA.",Is VCA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
942,"The beneficial effects of Acanthopanax divaricatus var. albeofructus (ADA) extracts have been assessed by mutagenic and anti-mutagenic activities by Ames test. Mutation of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98, TA 100, TA1535, TA1537, and Escherichia coli WP2 uvr A was assayed in duplicates by the procedure of Maron and Ames in the presence or absence of S9 mix. As a result, ADA extracts were not mutagenic for S. typhimurium strains TA 98, TA 100, TA1535, TA1537, and E. coli by the Ames assay. Anti-mutagenic activity was assayed by the Ames mutagenicity assay using histidine mutant of S. typhimurium strains TA 98 and TA 100, using the plate-incorporation method. 2-Aminoanthrancene (2-AA), 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (AF-2), and sodium azide (NaN(3)) were used as the mutagens. ADA extracts showed a strong anti-mutagenic activity against 2-AA-induced mutagenesis which requires liver-metabolizing enzymes, and the same extract exhibited inhibitory effects on AF-2 and NaN(3)-induced mutagenesis in the absence of liver-metabolizing enzymes. The data indicate that ADA extracts contain anti-mutagenic activities against typical mutagens. The anti-mutagenic property of ADA provides additional health supplemental value to the other claimed therapeutic properties of the plant.",Is 2-Aminoanthrancene mutagenic for TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
943,"Over the past few decades, scientific research has indicated a credible basis for some of the traditional ethnomedicinal uses of pomegranate. This study aims to evaluate the broad spectrum antioxidant and antimutagenic activities of peel extracts of pomegranate. The sequentially extracted Punica granatum peel fractions were tested for their antioxidant activity by DPPH free radical scavenging, phosphomolybdenum, FRAP (Fe(3+) reducing power) and CUPRAC (cupric ions (Cu(2+)) reducing ability) assays. The methanol fraction showed highest antioxidant activity by all the four in vitro assays comparable to ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) followed by activity in ethanol, acetone, and ethyl acetate fractions. Based on the promising antioxidant activities, the methanol fraction was evaluated for antimutagenic activity by Ames Salmonella/microsome assay against sodium azide (NaN(3)), methyl methane sulphonate (MMS), 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) and benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) induced mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium (TA97a, TA98, TA100 and TA102) tester strains. The methanol fraction showed no sign of mutagenicity at tested concentration of 10-80μg/mL. This fraction showed antimutagenic activity against NaN(3) and MMS with percent inhibition of mutagenicity ranging from 66.76% to 91.86% in a concentration-dependent manner. Similar trend of inhibition of mutagenicity (81.2-88.58%) against indirect mutagens (2-AF and B(a)P) was also recorded. Phytochemical analysis by HPLC, LC-MS and total phenolic content revealed high content of ellagitannins which might be responsible for promising antioxidant and antimutagenic activities of P. granatum peel extract. Further, contribution of bioactive compounds detected in this study is to be explored to understand the exact mechanism of action as well as their therapeutic efficacy.",Is 2-AF mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
944,"The ajowain (Carum copticum (L.)) is a popular spice and traditionally used in Indian system of medicine. Considering the importance of natural products in modern phytomedicine, the antioxidant and antimutagenic activities of C. copticum fruits extract and its fractions were evaluated. The methanol fraction showed highest antioxidant activity by phosphomolybdenum (2087.7 micromol) and DPPH assay (90.2%) followed by other fractions comparable to ascorbic acid and BHT. Based on antioxidant activity, methanol fraction was evaluated for antimutagenic potential against direct acting mutagens sodium azide (NaN(3)) and methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) and indirect acting mutagens 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) and benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), using Salmonella typhimurium (TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA102) tester strains. The methanolic fraction showed no sign of mutagenicity at tested concentrations (25-100 microg/plate). Antimutagenic activity was recorded with inhibition of mutagenicity ranging from 10.8% to 83.1% in a concentration dependent manner. The phytochemical analysis by IR, HPLC, GC-MS, and total phenolic assay revealed a high content of phenolic terpenoids. Further, characterization of active principle is needed to understand the mechanism of action and therapeutic efficacy in vivo.",Is 2-aminofluorene mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
945,"The isoflavonoid fractions obtained from a methanolic extract of Belamcanda chinensis (L.) DC (syn. Iris domestica Goldblatt & Mabb.) rhizomes inhibited the chemically induced mutations in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 in the Ames test. We have studied direct mutagenesis induced by N-nitroquinoline, and indirect mutation induction caused by metabolically activated 2-AF. The fractions enriched in isoflavonoids, obtained by sequential liquid-liquid extraction with diethyl ether and butanol, followed by ODS column separation, inhibited indirect mutagenesis in TA98 almost completely. In TA100 the maximum inhibition ranged between 80% and 100% depending on the test fraction. The inhibition of direct mutagenesis was lower, reaching about 50% in TA98 and in TA100, but it was dose-dependent only in the latter strain. Three in vitro anti-oxidant spectrophotometric assays-DPPH free-radical scavenging test, the phosphomolybdenum assay, and the linoleic acid peroxidation assay were also performed to support the process of bioactivity-guided fractionation and to provide more information about the potential mechanisms of action of the herb under study. The isoflavonoid fractions have the capability to scavenge free radicals, to reduce transition-metal ions and to protect polyunsaturated fatty acids from peroxidation. The analysis of the fractions obtained with high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode-array and mass-spectrometric detection revealed several potentially bioactive isoflavones, either as glycosides or aglycones, depending on the polarity of the solvents used for fractionation. The main compounds were tectoridin and iridin in the glycoside fractions and the aglycones irigenin, tectorigenin, and 5,6,7,3'-tetrahydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavone. The activities reported here can be regarded to be of additional value when using this plant as a phyto-estrogenic and chemopreventive agent.",Is N-nitroquinoline mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
946,"Rubia cordifolia L. (Rubiaceae) is an important medicinal plant used in the Ayurvedic medicinal system. Its use as a traditional therapeutic has been related to the treatment of skin disorders and cancer. Besides its medicinal value, anthraquinones from this plant are used as natural food colourants and as natural hair dyes. Dyes derived from natural sources have emerged as important alternatives to synthetic dyes. Alizarin (1,2-dihydroxyanthraquinone) was isolated and characterized from R. cordifolia L. and evaluated for its antigenotoxic potential against a battery of mutagens viz. 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD) and 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) in Ames assay using TA98 tester strain of Salmonella typhimurium; hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) in SOS chromotest using PQ37 strain of Escherichia coli and in Comet assay using human blood lymphocytes. Our results showed that alizarin possessed significant modulatory role against the genotoxicity of mutagens.",Is 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
947,"Chemical models for cytochrome P450, consisting of water-insoluble or water-soluble iron porphyrin plus an oxidant, have been used to detect the mutagenicity of promutagens in genotoxicity assays. The procedure for using chemical models for cytochrome P450 as substitutes for the S9 mix in the Ames assay have been already established. Aromatic amines and amides require metabolic activation by cytochrome P450 when they exert their mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains. In this study, we optimized the conditions of the assay using a water-soluble chemical model, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrinatoiron(III) pentachloride (4-MPy), plus tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH), magnesium monoperoxyphthalate, or iodosylbenzene, by comparing the mutagenicity of 2-aminofluorene (AF) in the Ames test. The model with 4-MPy/t-BuOOH showed the highest AF mutagenic potency. The chemical model activated 2-naphthylamine, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine in S.typhimurium TA98. In aromatic amides, the model with 4-MPy/t-BuOOH weakly activated 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF). To detect higher mutagenicity of aromatic amides, we used a higher concentration of 4-MPy/t-BuOOH by a factor of 5 over that used for aromatic amines, and then detected the mutagenicity of AAF, 2-acetylaminoanthracene, and 2-acetylamino-9-fluorenone. Furthermore, we concluded that the AAF mutagenicity in the presence of 4-MPy/t-BuOOH is derived from N-hydroxylacetylamino compounds.",Is AAF mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
948,"Naturally occurring compounds can have protective effects towards mutagens and carcinogens as shown by numerous studies. In the present study, the genotoxic/antigenotoxic activities of the extract from lichen Cetraria aculeata (Schreb.) Fr., which has been identified as an antibacterial agent in former studies, were investigated against known mutagens such as 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (4-NPD) and 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) in TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium in the presence or absence of metabolic activity. Further genotoxicity/antigenotoxicity of the extract against mitomycin C for micronucleus formation was also evaluated in human lymphocytes. The cytotoxic effects of the extract on mammalian cells were investigated in three different cell line types by MTT assay. The results obtained show that the extract of C. aculeata has a significant antigenotoxic activity in bacterial systems, but not in mammalian cells and cytotoxic activity in some mammalian cancer cells. However, it was not mutagenic in all systems. The findings suggest that the lichen extract may have a possible therapeutic potential and therefore this must be further investigated by other multiple in vitro bioassays for the development of therapeutic agents.",Is lichen mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
949,"The aim of this study was to explore the potential pro- and anti-mutagenic effects of endogenous bile pigments unconjugated bilirubin (BR), biliverdin (BV) and a synthetic, water soluble conjugate, bilirubin ditaurate (BRT) in the Ames Salmonella test. The bile pigments were tested over a wide concentration range (0.01-2 micromol/plate) in the presence of three bacterial strains (TA98, TA100, TA102). A variety of mutagens including benzo[alpha]pyrene (B[alpha]P), 2,4,7 trinitrofluorenone (TNFone), 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), sodium azide (NaN(3)) and tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH), were used to promote the formation of mutant revertants. Tests were conducted with (B[alpha]P, 2-AF, t-BuOOH) and without (TNFone, NaN(3), t-BuOOH) metabolic activation incorporating the addition of the microsomal liver preparation, S9. The bile pigments alone did not induce mutagenicity in any of the strains tested (p>0.05). Anti-mutagenic effects of the bile pigments were observed in the presence of all mutagens except for NaN(3) and the anti-mutagenic effects appeared independent of the strain tested. For TNFone induced genotoxicity, the order of effectiveness was BR> or =BRT>BV. However, the order was BV> or =BRT> or =BR for 2-AF. Antioxidant testing in the TA102 strain revealed bile pigments could effectively inhibit the genotoxic effect of t-BuOOH induced oxidative stress. The apparent antioxidant and anti-mutagenic behaviour of bile pigments further suggests their presence in biological systems is of possible physiological importance.",Is bilirubin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
950,"beta-Ionone (BIO) is a degraded (C(13)) sesquiterpenoid compound found in a variety of edible and aromatic plants. BIO and other ionone derivatives have been used in fragrance products and as flavoring food additives. In this study we investigated the mutagenic and antimutagenic activities of BIO using the Salmonella/microsome assay. Mutagenicity was evaluated by two tests with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA98, TA97a and TA1535, without and with addition of S9 mixture. A first assay was performed by the plate incorporation procedure and a confirmation test by the pre-incubation method. In either test, no increase in the number of his(+) revertant colonies over the negative (solvent) control values was noted with any of the four tester strains thereby indicating that BIO was not genotoxic in the Salmonella assay. Antimutagenic activity was investigated by testing (by the plate incorporation method) different non-toxic doses of BIO against one or more non-toxic doses of direct-acting (sodium azide: SA, 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide: 4-NQNO, 2-nitrofluorene: 2-NF and nitro-o-phenylenediamine: NPD) as well as indirect-acting (cyclophosphamide: CP, benzo[a]pyrene: B[a]P, aflatoxin B1: AFB1, 2-aminoanthracene: 2-AA, and 2-aminofluorene: 2-AF) mutagens. BIO did not alter the effects of any direct-acting mutagen or B[a]P and 2-AF. Mutagenic effects of AFB1 and CP, however, were markedly and dose-dependently antagonized by BIO. It has been reported that, in the rat liver, activation of B[a]P and 2-AF depend on CYP1A1 activity, and that CYP2B subfamily is involved in the metabolic activation of CP and AFB1. It has also been described that BIO is a potent inhibitor of CYP2B1/2 and a weaker inhibitor of CYP1A1. Therefore, antagonism of CP-and AFB1-induced mutagenic effects by BIO could have been mediated-at least in part-by the inhibition of CYP2B enzymes.",Is BIO mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
951,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-AB), and benzidine (Bz). The cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and intestinal anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. In addition, the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome P450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectrum. This was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. Our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-AF, 4-AB, and Bz into mutagens. The metabolic activation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. For those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a P450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.",Is 4-aminobiphenyl mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
952,"The hot water extract of the herbal tea, Gynostemma pentaphyllum Makino, was not found to be mutagenic in Salmonella mutation assay with or without metabolic activation. However, the extract had both DT-diaphorase inducing activity in the murine hepatoma (Hepa1c1c7) cell line and antimutagenic properties towards chemical-induced mutation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100.

However, the extract enhanced the mutagenicity induced by 2-aminoanthracene (2AA), and N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG).",Is Gynostemma pentaphyllum Makino mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
953,"alpha-Bisabolol (BISA) is a sesquiterpene alcohol found in the oils of chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) and other plants. BISA has been widely used in dermatological and cosmetic formulations. This study was undertaken to investigate the mutagenicity and antimutagenicity of BISA in the Salmonella/microsome assay. Mutagenicity of BISA was evaluated with TA100, TA98, TA97a and TA1535 Salmonella typhimurium strains, without and with addition of S9 mixture. No increase in the number of his+ revertant colonies over the negative (solvent) control values was observed with any of the four tester strains. In the antimutagenicity assays, BISA was tested up to the highest nontoxic dose (i.e. 50 and 150 microg/plate, with and without S9 mix, respectively) against direct-acting (sodium azide, SA; 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, 4-NQNO; 2-nitrofluorene, 2-NF; and nitro-o-phenylenediamine, NPD) as well as indirect-acting (cyclophosphamide, CP; benzo[a]pyrene, B[a]P; aflatoxin B1, AFB1; 2-aminoanthracene, 2-AA; and 2-aminofluorene, 2-AF) mutagens. BISA did not alter mutagenic activity of SA and of NPD, and showed only a weak inhibitory effect on the mutagenicity induced by 4-NQNO and 2-NF. The mutagenic effects of AFB1, CP, B[a]P, 2-AA and 2-AF, on the other hand, were all markedly and dose-dependently reduced by BISA. It was also found that BISA inhibited pentoxyresorufin-o-depentylase (PROD, IC50 2.76 microM) and ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD, 33.67 microM), which are markers for cytochromes CYP2B1 and 1A1 in rat liver microsomes. Since CYP2B1 converts AFB1 and CP into mutagenic metabolites, and CYP1A1 activates B[a]P, 2-AA and 2-AF, results suggest that BISA-induced antimutagenicity could be mediated by an inhibitory effect on the metabolic activation of these promutagens.",Is BISA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
954,"Aromatic amines are metabolically activated into mutagenic compounds by both animal and plant systems. The 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NOP) is a well-known direct-acting mutagen whose mutagenic potential can be enhanced by plant metabolism; m-phenylenediamine (m-PDA) is converted to mutagenic products detected by the Salmonella typhimurium TA98 strain, and 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) is the plant-activated promutagen most extensively studied. Plant cells activate both 2-AF and m-PDA into potent mutagens producing DNA frameshift mutations. Coriander (Coriandrum sativum) is a common plant included in the Mexican diet, usually consumed uncooked. The antimutagenic activity of coriander juice against the mutagenic activity of 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine, m-phenylenediamine and 2-aminofluorene was investigated using the Ames reversion mutagenicity assay (his- to his+) with the S. typhimurium TA98 strain as indicator organism. The plant cell/microbe coincubation assay was used as the activating system for aromatic transformation and plant extract interaction. Aqueous crude coriander juice significantly decreased the mutagenicity of metabolized aromatic amines (AA) in the following order: 2-AF (92.43%) > m-PDA (87.14%) > NOP (83.21%). The chlorophyll content in vegetable juice was monitored and its concentration showed a positive correlation with the detected antimutagenic effect. Protein content and peroxidase activity were also determined. The concentration of coriander juice (50-1000 microl/coincubation flask) was neither toxic nor mutagenic. The similar shape of the antimutagenic response curves obtained with coriander juice and chlorophyllin (used as a subrogate molecule of chlorophyll) indicated that comparable mechanisms of mutagenic inhibition could be involved. The negative correlation between chlorophyll content and mutagenic response of the promutagenic and direct-acting used amines allows us to deduce that a chemical interaction takes place between the two molecules, leading to the inactivation of mutagenic moiety.",Is m-phenylenediamine mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
955,"Short-term tests that detect genetic damage have provided information needed for evaluating carcinogenic risks of chemicals to man. The mutagenicity of cis-bis(3-aminoflavone)dichloroplatinum(II) (cis-[Pt(AF)2Cl2]) in comparison with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cis-DDP) was evaluated in the standard plate-incorporation assay in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium: TA97a, TA98, TA100 and TA102, in experiments with and without metabolic activation. It was shown that cis-[Pt(AF)2Cl2] acts directly and is mutagenic for three strains of S. typhimurium: TA97a, TA98 and TA100. In comparison with cis-DDP this compound showed a weaker genotoxicity. Contrary to cis-DDP it has not shown toxic properties in the tester bacteria. The genotoxicity of both tested compounds was evaluated using chromosomal aberration, sister chromatid exchange and micronucleus assays, without and with metabolic activation, in human lymphocytes in vitro. The inhibitory effects of both compounds on mitotic activity, cell proliferation kinetics and nuclear division index were also compared. In all test systems applied, cis-[Pt(AF)2Cl2] was a less effective clastogen and a weaker inducer of both sister chromatid exchanges and micronuclei in comparison with cis-DDP, with and without metabolic activation. cis-[Pt(AF)2Cl2] has a direct mechanism of action and is less cytostatic and cytotoxic than the other compound. These results provide important data on the genotoxicity of cis-[Pt(AF)2Cl2] and indicate its beneficial properties as a potential anticancer drug, especially in comparison with cis-DDP.",Is cis-[Pt(AF)2Cl2] mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
956,"Antimutagens from gaiyou (Artemisia argyi Levl. et Vant., Compositae) were examined. The methanol extract prepared from aerial parts of this plant strongly reduced the mutagenicity of 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), when Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was used in the presence of the rat liver microsomal fraction. The antimutagens were purified chromatographically while monitoring the antimutagenic activity against Trp-P-2 with a modified Ames test employing a plate method. This purification resulted in the isolation of four strong antimutagens, 5,7-dihydroxy-6,3',4'-trimethoxyflavone (eupatilin), 5, 7,4'-trihydroxy-6,3'-dimethoxyflavone (jaceosidin), 5,7, 4'-trihydroxyflavone (apigenin) and 5,7, 4'-trihydroxy-3'-methoxyflavone (chrysoeriol) from the methanol extract. These antimutagenic flavones exhibited strong antimutagenic activity against not only Trp-P-2 but also against other heterocyclic amines, such as 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4, 3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3, 8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-3-methyl-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (MeA(alpha)C) in S. typhimurium TA98. In contrast, they did not exhibit antimutagenic activity against benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO), 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 2-nitrofluorene (2-NF) or furylfuramide (AF-2) in S. typhimurium TA98, or B[a]P, 4-NQO, 2-NF, AF-2, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) or sodium azide (SA) in Salmonella typhimurium TA100, whereas they decreased the mutagenicity caused by aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) and 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA) in both of these tester strains. Regarding the structure-activity relationship, the tested flavones had distinct differences in the intensities of their antimutagenic activities according to the differences of their substitution patterns. Namely, the intensity of antimutagenic activities against Trp-P-2 decreased in the order of: 5,7,3',4'-tetrasubstituted flavones (IC(50): <0.1 mmol/plate), 5,7,4'-trisubstituted flavones (IC(50): 0.120-0.260 mmol/plate), 5,6,7,3',4'-pentasubstituted flavones (IC(50): 0.440-0. 772 mmol/plate). The four isolated flavones were also studied regarding their antimutagenic mechanisms with preincubation methods of the modified Ames test and emission spectroscopic analysis. The results suggested that all isolated flavones were desmutagens which directly inactivated Trp-P-2 or inhibited its metabolic activation.",Is eupatilin mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
957,"Extracts of Aloe vera Linne have been found to exhibit cytotoxicity against human tumour cell lines. This study examines the anti-tumour effects of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) isolated from Aloe vera Linne, in human and animal cell lines. Its anti-mutagenic effects were examined using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains. Growth inhibition was specifically exerted by DEHP against three leukaemic cell lines at concentrations below 100 microg mL(-1). At 100 microg mL(-1) DEHP, K562, HL60 and U937 leukaemic cell lines showed growth inhibition of 95, 97 and 95%, respectively. DEHP exhibited an inhibitory activity of 74, 83 and 81%, respectively, in K562, HL60 and U937 cell lines at a concentration of 10 microg mL(-1). At a concentration of 1 microg mL(-1), DEHP exerted an inhibitory activity of 50, 51 and 52%, respectively, in K562, HL60 and U937. In a normal cell line, MDBK, DEHP exerted 30% growth inhibition at a concentration of 100 microg mL(-1), and showed no inhibitory activity at concentrations below 50 microg mL(-1). It was found that DEHP exerted anti-mutagenic activity in the Salmonella mutation assay. The number of mutant colonies of Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 upon exposure to AF-2 (0.2 microg/plate) decreased in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of different DEHP concentrations (decreasing to 90.4, 83.9, 75.4, 69.6 and 46.9%, respectively, for DEHP concentrations of 100, 50, 10, 5 and 1 microg/plate). In the case of Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100, DEHP reduced AF-2-induced mutagenicity at 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 microg/plate to 57.4, 77.5, 80.0, 89.0 and 91.5%, respectively.

958,"Possible mutagenic and co-mutagenic effects of strong static magnetic fields were estimated using bacterial mutagenicity test. Mutagenic potential of static magnetic fields up to 5T (T:1T=10,000 G) was not detected by the bacterial mutagenicity test using four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537) and Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA either in the pre-incubation method or in the plate incorporation method. In the co-mutagenicity test, E. coli WP2 uvrA cells were treated with various chemical mutagens and were simultaneously exposed to a 2T or a 5T static magnetic field. Mutation rate in the exposed group was significantly higher than that in the non-exposed group when cells were treated with N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS), 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO), 2-amino-3-methyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) or 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (AF-2). The mutagenicity of 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA), 9-aminoacridine (9-AA), N4-aminocytidine and 2-acetoamidofluorene (2-AAF) was not affected by the magnetic field exposure.

959,"Fifteen kinds of commonly consumed Thai vegetables were sequentially extracted with hexane, chloroform and methanol, and then tested for antimutagenic activities against direct-acting (AF-2 and NaN3) and indirect-acting (AFB1 and B(a)P) mutagens using Ames' Salmonella mutagenicity test with Salmonella typhimurium TA100 as tester strain. It was found that only the methanol extract of neem leaves contain weak antimutagen inhibiting the mutagenicities of both direct-acting mutagens. Interestingly, all vegetables studied were found to contain chemical compounds, mainly nonpolar ones, capable of inhibiting the mutagenicity of AFB1, while only some vegetables contain chemical compounds capable of inhibiting the mutagenicity of B(a)P, which is also an indirect-acting mutagen. Studies on anticarcinogenic potentials demonstrated that Thai bitter gourd fruits, but not sweet basil leaves, at the concentration of 6.25% and 12.5% in the diet, partially inhibited DMBA-induced mammary gland carcinogenesis in female Sprague-Dawley rats when fed to the animals 2 weeks prior to DMBA. Results in the present study therefore demonstrated that most Thai vegetables contain antimutagens inhibiting the mutagenicity of some indirect-acting mutagen, particularly AFB1. The mechanism of their antimutagenicity may probably be the inhibition of the activity of metabolic-activating enzymes in rat liver homogenates. Very interestingly, our results clearly reveal that Thai bitter gourd fruits, which possess Phase II enzymes inducing property, as well as the ability to reduce Phase I enzyme activities in rat liver, contain some anticarcinogens or chemopreventive agents. However, sweet basil leaves that possess both Phase I and Phase II enzyme-inducing properties may not contain any anticarcinogen, at least against DMBA-induced mammary gland carcinogenesis.",Is neem leaves mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
960,"Extracts, isolated through sequential fractionation and partition procedures described previously (Martinez et al. 1994) from aflatoxin-free corn and aflatoxin-contaminated corn with and without ammonia treatment, were investigated for mutagenic potential using the Ames test (TA 100 tester strain). 2-Aminofluorene (2-AF) and pure aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) were used as positive controls. Although TA100 showed mutagenic response to pure AFB1 at a dose of ca 10 ng/plate, all isolates tested from ammonia-treated aflatoxin-contaminated corn containing 7500 ng AFB1/g did not exhibit positive results in the Ames test. Additionally, isolates from non-ammonia-treated aflatoxin-contaminated corn failed to give positive mutagenic potentials. These results indicate that differences between the mutagenic potentials of pure aflatoxins and of aflatoxins in naturally-contaminated corn exist. CH2Cl2 extracts (the fractions containing aflatoxins) obtained from aflatoxin-contaminated corn with and without ammonia treatment were applied to preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) in an effort to separate aflatoxins and/or ammonia/aflatoxin reaction products from the ""unknown interfering materials' existing in the corn matrix. Each of the fractions separated by TLC was tested by the Ames test with S9 activation and none of them gave a mutagenic response to TA100. CH2Cl2 extracts in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) obtained from non-ammonia-treated aflatoxin-free corn were spiked with pure AFB1 and tested by TA100 with S9 activation. Again, no positive responses were observed. These findings provide further evidence of ""unknown interfering materials' in corn which may bind with aflatoxin and/or can be extracted by CH2Cl2 together with aflatoxin, and, therefore, block the mutagenic activity of aflatoxin in the Ames test. Those materials were not separated from the aflatoxins by the TLC technique used in the present study. Possible reasons and further studies required to evaluate this phenomenon are discussed.",Is aflatoxins mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
961,"A chemical model system for cytochrome P450, a porphyrin and an oxidant, was used in Ames assay as a substitute for S9 mix. In the presence of tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrinatoiron(III) chloride [Fe(F5P)Cl] and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH), mutagenicity of N-nitrosodibutylamine (NDB) in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 was detected. The mutagenicity depended on the pre-incubation period, and also on the concentration of an oxidant and of bacteria. In the chemical model system, pH affected the mutagenicity of NDB, which suggested that as observed in an enzymatic activating system, the mutagenicity was due to the labile alkylating species which was derived from NDB activated in the chemical activation system and was sensitive to pH. Under the optimum conditions; a higher concentration of an oxidant, a higher concentration of bacterial culture, and a weakly acidic medium, mutagenicity of N-nitrosodipropylamine in S. typhimurium TA1535 was also detected. Besides N-nitrosodialkylamines, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) were also used as mutagens. Mutagenicity of 2-AF and BaP in S. typhimurium TA1538 were both detected in the same system as used in detecting the mutagenicity of N-nitrosodialkylamines. Ames test using a metalloporphyrin/oxidant model system makes it possible to detect mutagenicity derived from both base pair substitution mutagens and frameshift mutagens without using enzymatic activating system. These results demonstrate that the assay with the chemical model system is useful in detecting unstable unknown active mutagens or investigating the mechanisms of the metabolic pathway of mutagens or carcinogens in a protein-free medium.",Is NDB mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
962,"The antimutagenic effects of nine active compounds in the Chinese herbal medicine ""sho-saiko-to"" on mutagenesis induced by a direct-acting mutagen, 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (AF-2) were investigated in Salmonella typhimurium, strain TA100. The active compounds examined were classified into two major groups, saponins and flavonoids, the former comprising glycyrrhizin, saikosaponins a, c, and d, and ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg1, and the latter, baicalin, baicalein and wogonin. Saikosaponin a and ginsenoside Rb1 were found to reduce the mutagenicity of AF-2 significantly when applied post-AF-2-treatment in the Salmonella mutagenicity assay. Ginsenoside Rb1 also decreased the mutagenic activity of AF-2 in a simultaneous treatment protocol. The results indicate that saikosaponin a and ginsenoside Rb1 may enhance DNA repair, and ginsenoside Rb1 may also have the ability to inactivate the mutagenic activity of AF-2 directly. On the other hand, saikosaponin d and baicalin showed a slight enhancing effect. None of the compounds, except baicalein, showed any toxic effect on the test strain. These findings may be useful for the development of chemopreventive agents.",Is ginsenoside Rb1 mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
963,"The study was carried out to characterize hepatoma cells (Hep G2) as activation system relevant to man and to investigate which are the tester strains most suitable for the mutagenic assay of aromatic amines. A supernatant prepared from the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2 was used to activate benzidine, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) and 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) in the Salmonella typhimurium reversion assay. Activation by Hep G2 supernatant was studied with increasing concentrations of the three compounds, in tester strains TA98, YG1024, DJ400 and DJ460. Benz[alpha]anthracene (BA) pretreatment of cells increases the mutagenicity of benzidine in strains YG1024, DJ460 and DJ400. Activation of 2-AAF and 2-AF was observed in strains YG1024, DJ400 and, at the highest tested dose, in DJ460. These results were compared with those obtained with S9 from control and Aroclor 1254 (Aro)-pretreated rat liver. With strain TA98 comparable responses were obtained except for 2-AF which was better activated using rat liver S9. The use of strain YG1024 greatly increases the sensitivity of the response. Strain DJ460 makes it possible to detect activation of 2-AF and 2-AAF by Aro-induced rat liver. These results indicate that Hep G2 supernatant is a useful metabolic activation system of human origin that can be used to replace rat liver S9. An appropriate choice of the Salmonella strain not only can increase the sensitivity of the response, but may also help to overcome certain metabolic shortcomings of the Hep G2 cell line and rat liver S9.",Is Benz[alpha]anthracene mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
964,"Three kinds of spices (caraway, coriander and black pepper seeds) and a medicinal plant called 'tong tak' in Thai (Baliospermum axillar, a species of the spurge family) were fractionated into hot water, methanol and hexane extracts. These extracts were not mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 by the Ames assay. However, when the extracts were treated with nitrite, samples of the water and methanol extracts were mutagenic for strain TA100 without metabolic activation. The mutagenicity of the nitrite-treated methanol and hot water extracts of black pepper was highest (8380 and 22,200 His+ per 0.1 g of spice powder, respectively), and that of the nitrite-treated hot water extracts of caraway and tong tak was moderate. The hot water extracts were examined for their antimutagenic activity against mutagenicity induced by various carcinogens by the Ames assay, using the preincubation technique. The tested samples (equivalent to 1-2 mg of spice powder) reduced the mutagenicity induced by 2.7 nmole (397 ng) of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine by more than 84%, and that induced by dimethylnitrosamine (1.48 mg) or ICR-170 (10 ng) by 30-60%. However, they did not inhibit the mutagenic activity of 1-nitropyrene, 3-nitrofluoranthene, AF-2, methyl methanesulfonate, N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, 2-aminoanthracene, 2-acetylaminofluorene, benzo[a]pyrene or IQ.",Is tong tak mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
965,"The mutagenicity of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and its derivatives was investigated by the Ames method using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 with or without S9 mix. The compounds were not mutagenic in either indicator strain at concentrations ranging from 50 to 330 micrograms/plate (SQ: 3,5,3',5'-tetra-tert-butylstilbenequinone; VI-III: unidentified), 500 micrograms/plate (BE: 3,5,3',5'-tetra-tert-4,4'-dihydroxy-1,2-diphenylethylene; VI: 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl-4-tert-butylperoxy-2,5-cyclohexadienone ; VI-I: unidentified; VI-II: 3-acetyl-2,5-di-tert-cyclopenta-2,4-dienone) and 1000 micrograms/plate (BHT). The antimutagenic effects of BHT and its derivatives on mutagenesis by chemical agents were investigated in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 and Escherichia coli WP-2 hcr-. VI-II suppressed the mutagenesis induced in TA98 and TA100 by 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (AF-2) and that induced in WP-2 hcr- by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) without decreasing cell viability. In WP-2 hcr-, the mutagenesis induced by AF-2 and ethyl methanesulfonate was also suppressed significantly. Mutations induced by methyl methanesulfonate were slightly inhibited. However, VI-II had no effect on the mutagenesis induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine.",Is BHT mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
966,"Crude extracts and partially purified as well as purified fractions were prepared from three Thai medicinal plants, namely, Acanthus ebracteatus Vahl, Plumbago indica Linn, and Rhinacanthus nasuthus Kurz, and then tested for their mutagenic and antimutagenic potentials using the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test. All fractions tested were not mutagenic toward either strain TA98 or TA100 whether tested in the presence or absence of S-9 mix. Interestingly, however, various fractions--especially those extracted by organic solvents such as petroleum ether, hexane, and chloroform, as well as some purified compounds from these plants--could strongly inhibit the mutagenicity of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), an indirect mutagen, when tested in the presence of S-9 mix but not that of 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (AF-2), which does not require metabolic activation for its mutagenicity. Furthermore, these fractions could markedly inhibit the activity of rat liver aniline hydroxylase, which is one of the cytochrome-P450-mediated reactions. These results therefore suggest that these Thai medicinal plants contain an antimutagen(s) which inhibits chemical mutagenesis by inhibiting the enzyme activities necessary for activation of indirect mutagens/carcinogens. Identification as well as anticarcinogenicity of purified compounds of these plants are being investigated in our laboratory.",Is aflatoxin B1 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
967,"The optimum concentrations of Aroclor-induced rat liver S9 microsomal fraction for the mutagenic activity of the four standard mutagens 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), acriflavine (ACR), benzo[a]pyrene (BP) and cyclophosphamide (CP) were determined in four mutation assays. The four assays were the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100, cycloheximide resistance in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mouse lymphoma TK assay and the human peripheral lymphocyte cytogenetic assay. BP was the only mutagen to be most active at comparable S9 concentrations, of approximately 1%, for all four assays. The optimum S9 concentrations for each of the remaining three mutagens varied substantially between the four assays. ACR was a potent direct-acting mutagen in both mammalian cell assays. The mouse lymphoma TK assay results showed similar optimal values of 1.5% S9 or below for each of the four test agents. The assay with the largest variation of optimal S9 values for the four mutagens was the Ames test in strain TA100, although it also had the widest peaks of activity over the range of S9 concentrations tested. It is likely that the diversity of findings is due to a variety of metabolites affecting the different genetic endpoints that are measured in these assays. Thus from these results it is not possible for bacterial optimization data to be related to other routine in vitro systems. The use of more than one concentration of S9 would contribute useful information.",Is ACR mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
968,"The Salmonella mutagenicity assay was utilized to compare hepatic S9 fractions derived from wild and laboratory reared woodchucks (Marmota monax). Two promutagens, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracence (DMBA) and 2-amino-fluorene (AF) were tested at 5 concentrations with the tester strains TA98 and TA100, against 2 levels of S9 fraction. AF produced similar number of revertants with the S9 fraction from wild and laboratory-reared animals. DMBA produced 2-4 times more revertant colonies at 50 microliter S9/plate with wild woodchuck S9 than with S9 from the laboratory-reared animals with both tester strains. It was concluded that natural inducers in the wild woodchuck diet may have contributed to the increased reversion frequency over laboratory reared woodchucks. Dose-response parameters for the activation of DMBA by S9 fraction from woodchucks and rats were compared with TA100. Woodchuck S9 had 3-40 more revertants/nmol and a 100-fold lower threshold of response than S9 from Aroclor 1254-induced rats.",Is DMBA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
969,"The Salmonella mutagenicity assay was utilized to compare the hepatic S9 fractions from untreated and 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) induced woodchucks with Aroclor 1254 induced rats. Three known promutagens, benzo[a]pyrene (BP), 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), and 2-aminofluorene (AF) were tested at 5 concentrations with the strain TA100 against 3 levels of S9 fraction. Both woodchuck S9 fractions were as effective as the rat S9 in activating BP and both were more effective than the rat S9 in activating DMBA. Untreated woodchuck S9 was also as effective as rat S9 in activating AF. The protein content of the S9 fraction did not differ significantly between rats and woodchucks, but the P-450 content of the rat S9 was approximately 3.5 times that of woodchuck.","Is 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene mutagenic for TA100 strain?",True

In the presence of an S9 activating system all the compounds were mutagenic in strains TA100, TA98 and TA1538 was 4-NH2-BP greater than 4-N(Ac)2-BP greater than 12-NH2-BP greater than 12-N(Ac)2-BP greater than AF greater than 11-NH2-BP congruent to BP greater than 6-NH2-BP; whereas in strain TA100, the order was 4-NH2-BP greater than 4-N(Ac)2-BP greater than BP greater than 12-NH2-BP congruent to 12-N(Ac)2-BP congruent to 11-NH2-BP greater than 6-NH2-BP congruent to AF. Inclusion of the deacylase inhibitor, paraoxon, in the incubation decreased the mutagenicity of 4-N(Ac)2-BP but had no effect on its primary amine. These data suggest that, at least for this group of compounds, arylamines derived from carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are activated to potent mutagens primarily through S9-mediated metabolism (e.g., N-oxidation) of the amine.",Is 6-NH2-BP mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
971,"Mutagenicities of AF-2, MNNG, 4NQO, aflatoxin B1, benzo [a] pyrene and Trp-P-1, with or without metabolic activation, were inactivated by treatment with human saliva to a great extent in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium test strains TA98 and TA100. Mutagenic activities of quercetin, pyrolysates of beef, salmon and sodium glutamate, and condensate of cigarette smoke were also decreased to some extent by saliva treatment, but no significant effect was found on the activity of MMS and pyrolysate of polypeptone. These effects showed individual variations. The inhibition of AF-2 mutagenicity by saliva varied with temperature in TA100 but not in TA98 cultures. Boiled saliva inactivated AF-2 mutagenicity in TA98 to some extent but not in TA100 cultures. Inactivation of AF-2 mutagenicity by saliva treatment was completed within 30 sec. Complex mechanisms may be involved in the inactivation of mutagenicity of carcinogens by saliva, including biochemical reactions with enzymes, vitamins, etc. and/or adsorption with high molecular weight substances in saliva such as proteins, bacterial cells, mucous materials, etc.",Is AF-2 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
972,"The mutagenic potential of total aqueous, total oligomers flavonoids (TOF), ethyl acetate (EA), chloroform (Chl), petroleum ether (PE) and methanol (MeOH) extracts from aerial parts of Moricandia arvensis was assessed using Ames Salmonella tester strains TA100 and TA1535 with and without metabolic activation (S9), and using plasmid pBluescript DNA assay. None of the different extracts produced a mutagenic effect, except aqueous extract when incubated with Salmonella typhimurium TA100 after metabolic activation. Likewise, the antimutagenicity of the same extracts was tested using the ""Ames test"". Our results showed that M. arvensis extracts possess antimutagenic effects against sodium azide (SA) in the two tested Salmonella assay systems, except metabolized aqueous and PE extracts when tested with S. typhimurium TA100 assay system. Different extracts were also found to be effective in protecting plasmid DNA against the strand breakage induced by hydroxyl radicals, except PE and aqueous extracts. Antioxidant capacity of the tested extracts was evaluated using the enzymatic (xanthine/xanthine oxidase assay) (X/XOD) and the non enzymatic (NBT/Riboflavine assay) systems.

973,"Polyphenols with antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic properties are present in fruits, vegetables and legumes. In this study, the Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98 and TA100 were used in the microsuspension assay to examine the antimutagenic effect of phenolic compounds extracted from the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) against mutagenicity induced by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). A dose-response curve was constructed for AFB1; from which a level of 40 ng AFB1/tube was selected for all antimutagenicity assays. The AFB1 and phenolic extract (PE) were not toxic to the bacteria at concentrations tested. In the case of PE, results were similar to the number of spontaneous revertants for TA98 and TA100. The inhibitory effect of PE against AFB1 mutagenicity was dose-dependent at the lower concentrations tested (2.5, 5, 10, 12.5, 15 and 25 microgram-equivalent (+)-catechin/tube for TA98; 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 5, 10 and 25 microgram-equivalent (+)-catechin/ tube for TA100). Further, a two-stage incubation procedure was used to investigate the potential interaction between PE and AFB1. The greatest inhibitory effect of the PE on AFB1 mutagenicity occurred when PE and AFB1 were incubated together. When the bacteria were first incubated with PE followed by a second incubation with AFB1, lower inhibition was observed. Lower inhibition was also observed when the bacteria were first incubated with AFB1 followed by a second incubation with PE. The results suggest that the mechanism of inhibition could involve the formation of a chemical complex between of PE and AFB1.",Is PE mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
974,"The widely used agricultural antifungal agent aureofungin (ARF) was subjected to genotoxicity assessment using the Ames Salmonella assay as well as the in vivo micronucleus test and dominant lethal test in Swiss mice. In the Ames Salmonella spot test, ARF slightly elevated the number of histidine revertants after metabolic activation over a wide dose range (1-1000 micrograms/plate) in TA102 but not in TA97a, TA98 or TA100. In the preincubation plate incorporation assay with TA102, ARF increased the number of revertants in a dose-dependent manner only after metabolic activation. ARF failed to significantly elevate the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (PE) in the bone marrow of Swiss mice. It elevated the frequency of dominant lethal mutations in the 7th and 8th weeks at 30 mg/kg body weight, a concentration much higher than the actual concentration used in the field. We conclude that ARF is non-mutagenic in somatic cells in vivo at doses used in the present study, probably mutagenic in stem-cell spermatogonia and may be classified as an equivocal promutagen, possibly acting as a cross-linker.",Is ARF mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
975,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the applicability of green tea seed (GTS) extract as a natural preservative in food. Food preservative ability and mutagenicity studies of GTS extract and identification of antimicrobial compounds from GTS extract were carried out. The GTS extract showed only anti-yeast activity against Candida albicans with MIC value of 938μg/mL and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii with a MIC of 469μg/mL. The active compounds were identified as theasaponin E1 (1), assamsaponin A (2), and assamsaponin B (3). And GTS extracts didn't show mutagenicity because there were no dose-dependent changes in colonies of Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and Escherichia coli WP 2 uvrA regardless of the metabolic activation system. And GTS extract also showed a potent food preservation affect which eliminated all yeast below the MIC value in application test at soy sauce.

The methanolic extract indicated no mutagenicity when tested with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. Antimutagenic activity was reported with inhibition of mutagenicity in a concentration dependent fashion. The methanolic extract demonstrated antioxidant activity in the DPPH radical-scavenging test (IC50 = 4.57 mg/mL), comparable to ascorbic acid and BHT. Moreover, the extract presented a remarkable and potent inhibition against soybean lipoxygenase (IC50 = 641.57 µg/mL).

977,"The acetone extract of Ochna pretoriensis was evaluated for antibacterial activity using bioautography and serial microplate dilution methods against four nosocomial bacterial pathogens namely: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude extract led to the isolation of two antibacterial biflavonoids, ochnaflavone and ochnaflavone 7-O-methyl ether. Gram-negative bacteria were more sensitive to the isolated compounds than the Gram-positive bacteria (MIC values: 31.3 microg/mL for P. aeruginosa and 62.5 microg/mL for S. aureus). In addition, the isolated compounds were assessed for their potential toxic effects in the MTT toxicity assay using monkey kidney vero cells and Ames genotoxicity test using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98. LC50 values were 125.9 microg/mL for ochnaflavone and 162.0/microg/mL for ochnaflavone 7-O-methyl ether. The isolated compounds have selectivity index values ranging from 1.29 to 4.03. Selectivity index values higher than one indicate that test samples are less toxic to the host cells than to the pathogens. The biflavonoids did not have any mutagenic effects in the Salmonella/microsome assay without metabolic activation.",Is Ochna pretoriensis mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
978,"The Salmonella typhimurium/microsome assay is a widely used bacterial genotoxicity assay to test potential carcinogens. The aim of this work was to evaluate the mutagenic and antimutagenic activities with and without the addition of an extrinsic metabolic activation system of essential oils obtained from an aerial part of Pituranthos chloranthus harvested from different stations in Tunisia. The oils showed no mutagenicity when tested with S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, and TA1535. On the other hand, we showed that these essential oils reduced significantly Benzo [a] pyrene (B[a] P) and sodium-azide-induced mutagenicity. The scavenging capacity of these essential oils was also estimated by evaluating the inhibition of DPPH radical. Essential oils harvested at Medenine and Gabes in November were more effective in scavenging activity. The essential oils were tested for their antimicrobial properties against five different bacteria, and were found to be weakly active, with MIC and MBC values in the range 0.6-4 and 2.2-5 mg/mL, respectively.",Is oils mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False

In the antibacterial test, anolignan B showed activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration values obtained (MIC) ranged from 3.8 microg/ml against Bacillus subtilis (Gram-positive) to 31 microg/ml against Escherichia coli (Gram-negative). In the anti-inflammatory assays, anolignan B showed activity against both COX-1 (IC(50) = 1.5 mM) and COX-2 (IC(50) = 7.5 mM) enzymes.

980,"Eight quinolones were examined for their bacterial mutagenicity in the Ames Salmonella TA102 assay and for their effects in other bacterial genotoxicity assays. In the quantitative Ames plate incorporation assay, all eight quinolones induced His+ deletion reversion in Salmonella tester strain TA102, with maximum reversion observed at about two to eight times the MIC. The quinolones also induced the SOS response. At quinolone concentrations close to the MIC, SOS cell filamentation gene sulA was induced in sulA::lacZ fusion strain Escherichia coli PQ37. RecA-mediated cleavage of lambda repressor in lambda::lacZ fusion strain E. coli BR513 was measurable at about 10 times the MIC, though no induction occurred at 20 micrograms of nalidixic or oxolinic acid per ml. Genotoxicity of quinolones also was observed in the Bacillus subtilis DNA repair assay, in which the mutant strain M45 (recA) was more susceptible to quinolones than its parent strain, H17 (rec+). The results from these analyses indicate that quinolones induce SOS functions and are mutagenic in bacteria; these properties correspond to their antimicrobial activities.",Is quinolones mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True
981,"Methyl isocyanate (MIC) in aqueous solution forms methylamine (MA) and N,N'-dimethylurea (DMU). MA in buffered system further converts into its salt form, methylamine hydrochloride (MAH). Therefore, MAH and DMU were evaluated for their mutagenic activity in the in vitro Ames Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test. The liquid preincubation protocol was followed, using tester strains TA98, TA100 and TA104 of Salmonella typhimurium, in the presence of 0, 5, 15 and 30% Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver S9 mixture. DMU and MAH did not induce a mutagenic response in any of the tester strains, both in the presence and in the absence of S9 mixture. The results therefore confirm that MIC in its native form or as its unknown metabolites is responsible for the mutagenic activity reported earlier by us in the his tester strains TA100 and TA104 of Salmonella typhimurium (Mutation Res., 204 (1988) 123-129) and not due to its hydrolysis products, MA or DMU.",Is MIC mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
982,"Methyl isocyanate (MIC) was tested for mutagenicity using the Ames Salmonella/microsome liquid-preincubation procedure with slight modification of test conditions. In the modification the preincubation mixture was incubated at 10 degrees C for 60 min.

MIC induced mutagenic response in two base-pair substitution strains, TA100 and TA104, in the presence and absence of S9. However, mutagenic response in the presence of S9 was low as compared to that in the absence of S9. In the comparative mutagenic activity at 3 different preincubation test conditions (37 degrees C for 20 min, 20 degrees C for 40 min and 10 degrees C for 60 min), optimum mutagenic response was observed at 10 degrees C for the 60-min test condition.

Three aluminum pots from the same manufacturer but of different years of use (6-year-old, 3-year-old, and new aluminum pots) were used for the experiment. Six selected heavy metals (Cadmium, Copper, Arsenic, Nickel, Lead, and Aluminum) were also analyzed in the samples using an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS Buck, Scientific model 210 VGP). Cadmium, Copper, Arsenic, Nickel, Lead, and Aluminum were present in all the test water samples at concentrations that were higher than the maximum limit allowable by standard regulatory organizations. The concentrations of these metals in the samples also increased as the duration of use of the aluminum pots increased. The results further showed that the water boiled in the three aluminum pots is mutagenic and genotoxic in both Ames fluctuation and SOS chromotests. The 6-year-old aluminum pot induced the highest mutagenicity and genotoxicity followed by the 3-year-old aluminum pot. The metals in the tested samples were believed to be responsible for the observed mutagenicity and genotoxicity in the microbial assays. The findings of this study revealed that cooking with Aluminum pots could lead to the leaching of heavy metals into food, and pose mutagenic and genotoxic risks to consumers.",Is Aluminum pots mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
984,"In Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assays the metabolic activation of 2-acetylaminofluorene (2AAF) was greater by isolated hepatocytes from two species resistant to 2AAF-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, the guinea-pig and rabbit, than by hepatocytes from the highly susceptible rat liver. S. typhimurium strain TA98/1,8DNP(6) was less sensitive to 2AAF-induced mutagenesis than strain TA98. Even in the absence of bacterial esterification (TA98/1,8DNP(6)), 2AAF mutagenicity was always lowest following activation by rat hepatocytes. Paraoxon (an inhibitor of deacetylase) inhibited by more than 90% the mutagenicity of 2AAF with rat and guinea-pig hepatocytes, but only partially inhibited the mutagenicity of N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene-a metabolite of 2AAF-particularly at low substrate concentrations. In a modified mutagenicity assay in which hepatocytes and 2AAF were pre-incubated before the addition of TA98, a reduction of 2AAF mutagenicity was observed with guinea-pig but not rat hepatocytes. Thus, even when the integrity of the cells used for metabolic activation is maintained, and when bacterial esterification is avoided, conventional Salmonella assays do not show a correlation between the mutagenicity of 2AAF in vitro and its carcinogenicity in vivo. The correlation may, however, be improved by modification of in vitro conditions.",Is Paraoxon mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
985,"An increase in the number of revertant colonies in the Ames test is generally taken as a strong indication of mutagenic activity of a test compound. However, irrelevant positive findings may constitute a major problem in regulatory drug testing. In this study, mixtures containing only amino acids such as glycine, lysine, arginine and isoleucine, routinely used as peptide preservatives in polypeptide pharmaceutical products, were investigated for mutagenesis in the Ames Salmonella typhimurium test. The results demonstrated that in the presence of metabolic activation, all the solutions containing arginine induced an increase in the number of revertant colonies in strains TA98, TA100 and TA1535 compared with the solvent control. More specifically, for strain TA98, all arginine doses tested, i.e. from 0.4 to 8 mg/plate induced a statistically significant increase in the number of revertants. This increase was biologically significant from 1.2 to 8 mg/plate. For strain TA100, the five highest test doses, i.e., from 1.2 to 8 mg/plate, induced statistically and biologically significant increases in the number of revertants. A statistically significant increase in colony number was also observed in strain TA1535, but only at the maximal test dose of 8 mg/plate arginine. These increases were observed with arginine from two different sources, suggesting that the observed effect would not be due to the presence of potential impurities in the type of arginine used. Our findings show that a functional metabolic activation system was required to induce an increase in the number of colonies. The presence of vitamin C inhibited the arginine-induced increase in the number of revertant colonies in S. typhimurium strain TA98, suggesting a potential involvement of oxidative stress.",Is arginine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
986,"Melanoidins are formed during household cooking procedures and are part of our daily diet, but data on their toxicological potential are still scarce. Therefore, the mutagenic, cytotoxic and genotoxic activity of the water soluble total fraction (sol A), the water soluble high molecular weight fraction (HMW; Molecular weight>12,400 Da) and the remaining water soluble low molecular weight fraction (LMW) isolated from a glucose-glycine model system roasted at 125 degrees C was comprehensively studied in human lymphocytes (genetic end point: sister chromatid exchange (SCE)), Caco-2 cells (SCE, cell viability, cell proliferation) and in the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA102 (Ames test). Tests were performed in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The results indicate a significant increase in SCE formation in human lymphocytes after the exposure to 0.05% and 0.1% of the melanoidin fractions. In Caco-2 cells, only the exposure to LMW increased the SCE formation as a matter of concentration. Cell's proliferation and viability decreased significantly after exposure to melanoidins. In the AMES test, melanoidins did not show a mutagenic potential, neither using the TA98 nor the TA102 strain. These results show that melanoidins isolated from the glucose-glycine mixture exhibited modest but significant genotoxic effects in human lymphocytes and, in particular the LMW, in Caco-2 cells, but they induce neither in low nor in very high concentrations mutagenicity in bacteria strains.",Is melanoidins mutagenic for TA98 or TA102 strain?,False
987,"The antimutagenic effects of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) prepared by heating three sugars (fructose, glucose and xylose) and four amino acids (arginine, glycine, lysine and tryptophan) at 100 degrees C for 10 hr was evaluated in the Salmonella/microsome assay. The highest extent of browning was found in the MRPs of sugars-lysine and xylose-amino acids. The MRPs of xylose-amino acids showed stronger antioxidative activity and reducing power than did the other combinations. No mutagenicity or toxicity in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was observed with any of the MRPs in the presence of S-9. Most MRPs, especially those of sugars-tryptophan and xylose-amino acids, strongly inhibited the mutagenicity of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoline (IQ), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyridol-(4,3-b)indole (Trp-P-1) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido(1,2-a:3',2'-d)imidazole (Glu-P-1) in the presence of S-9. However, the MRPs of fructose-glycine and fructose-arginine increased the mutagenicity of Trp-P-1. The antimutagenic effect of the MRPs was well correlated with their antioxidative activity and reducing power. The mutagenicity of benzo[a]pyrene was moderately inhibited by most MRPs, but was increased by the MRP of glucose-arginine. Aflatoxin B1 mutagenicity was increased greatly by all the MRPs except that of xylose-tryptophan. The findings suggested that MRPs might have a bifunctional property of co-mutagenicity and antimutagenicity in certain cases.",Is MRPs mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
988,"Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) was evaluated as an antimutagen in the Ames Salmonella tester strain assay. Taurine inhibited mutagenesis by doxorubicin (-74%), bleomycin (-55%), mitomycin C (-56%), and 2-aminofluorene (-52%), but not danthrone or benzo(a)pyrene, in strain TA102. In strain TA98, doxorubicin mutagenicity, but not that of 2-aminofluorene or benzo(a)pyrene, was inhibited by taurine. N-Methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (-73%), but not dexon, mutagenicity was inhibited by taurine in strain TA100. Taurine inhibited those mutagens against which it was effective in a dose-related fashion. Taurine was more effective in inhibiting doxorubicin mutagenicity in strain TA102 than its analogues hypotaurine, beta-alanine, and guanidinoethanesulfonic acid or alanine or glycine. The observed inhibition may indicate a role for taurine in modulating the activity of oxidant species.",Is Taurine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
989,"Dimethylglycine (DMG) and the chemically related amino acids glycine, sarcosine (monomethylglycine) and betaine (trimethylglycine) were tested in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 after treatment with sodium nitrite under acidic conditions using a modified Ames Salmonella/microsome assay as reported by Colman et al. (1980). The increase in the number of revertants observed both with and without metabolic activation was also induced in the control mixtures without adding the amines. From the subsequent testing of the individual components of the mixtures, we concluded that non-consumed nitrite was responsible for the mutagenic responses observed in the different reaction mixtures, and not the amines themselves. There were no consistent indications of mutagenic activity of the DMG test mixture as compared to the control mixture which exhibited both consistent mutagenic activity and a toxic effect which was not increased by the addition of DMG. In fact, DMG seemed to decrease the toxicity of the control reaction solution to the Salmonella which was clearly observed at the higher doses. DMG cannot be considered mutagenic under the test conditions employed. The same can be said of the other amino acids as well.",Is DMG mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
990,"Ten different amino acid-glucose Maillard browning products before and after reaction with nitrite were evaluated by the Ames mutagenicity assay. No mutagenic response was observed in the methylene chloride extracts of any browning products tested before nitrosation. However, mutagenicity was showed in most of the browning mixtures, e.g., glycine-glucose, lysine-glucose (I), arginine-glucose, phenylalanine-glucose (II), and methionine-glucose after nitrosation when examined by Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 either with or without S-9 metabolic activation. Among the browning mixtures, (I) and (II) showed the greatest mutagenic activity after reaction with nitrite. The mutagenicity of lysine-glucose with nitrite was dependent on browning intensity, nitrosation pH, nitrosation time, nitrite level and blocking agents.",Is browning mixtures mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
991,"Different scavengers of active oxygen species (superoxide dismutase, catalase, mannitol and dimethylfuran) were tested in the Ames Salmonella assay to determine the role of the reactive oxygen species in the benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) mutagenesis process. Exogenously added superoxide dismutase or catalase at 10-100 micrograms ml-1 top agar, or 3-12 mM mannitol showed no effect on B[a]P mutagenicity in the presence of S9 mix. However, dimethylfuran (DMF), a singlet oxygen scavenger, inhibited in a dose-related manner the mutagenic response of B[a]P in the presence of the microsomal fraction. DMF at 3 and 6 mM inhibited the number of revertants by 69 and 93% for strain TA 100, and 76 and 78% for TA98, respectively. DMF at these levels was neither toxic nor mutagenic to the bacteria. The result indicates that singlet oxygen may play an important role in promoting B[a]P mutagenicity.",Is DMF mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
992,"Cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia) is an important spice which is widely consumed in the Indian subcontinent as well as in several other parts of the world. In the present study, NMR spectroscopy showed the presence of cinnamaldehyde to be the major component of the bark. The possible mutagenic effects of cinnamon bark ethanolic extract (CEE, 0.01-1 mg/plate) cinnamon oil (CNO, 0.125-1 mg/plate), and its active component cinnamadehyde (CLD, 0.125-1 mg/plate) were evaluated. Antimutagenic activity of CEE, CNO, and CLD was also tested against various food borne mutagens (heterocyclic amines and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)) and sodium azide (SA) using Ames assay. Similarly, the antimicrobial activity was studied using agar well diffusion assay against various pathogens. CEE was non-mutagenic in any of the five tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102, and TA104) in Ames test. CEE exhibited antimutagenic activity against all the mutagens tested in the higher doses. Additionally, CEE, CNO, and CLD were effective against various pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, S. typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli in the agar well diffusion assay. Promising antimutagenic and antimicrobial properties were shown by the cinnamon bark ethanolic extract and cinnamaldehyde, respectively. Therefore, their role in cancer chemoprevention, as well as a natural antimicrobial agent must be exploited and studied in depth in in vivo conditions.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
993,"Context Seaweeds from the Mexican Pacific Ocean have not been evaluated as a source of chemoprotectants. Objective The objective of this study is to evaluate chemopreventive activities of the seaweeds Phaephyceae - Padina durvillaei (Dictyotaceae) - Rodhophyceae - Spyridia filamentosa (Spyridiaceae), Gracilaria vermiculophylla (Gracilariaceae) - and Chlorophyceae - Ulva expansa (Ulvaceae), Codium isabelae (Codiaceae), Rhizoclonium riparium (Cladophoraceae) and Caulerpa sertularioides (Caulerpaceae). Materials and methods Methanol, acetone and hexane seaweed extracts were assessed at 30 and 3 mg/mL on antioxidant capacity (DPPH and ABTS assays), 0.003-3.0 mg/plate on antimutagenic activity against AFB1 using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 tester strains in Ames test, and 12.5 to 100 μg/mL on antiproliferative activity on Murine B-cell lymphoma. Phenols, flavonoids and pigments content were also assessed as antioxidant compounds. Results Extraction yield was higher in methanol than in acetone and hexane extracts (6.4, 2.7 and 1.4% dw). Antioxidant capacity was higher in brown and green than in red seaweed species, particularly in P. durvillaei extracted in acetone (EC50  value= 16.9 and 1.56 mg/mL for DPPH and ABTS). Flavonoids and chlorophylls were identified as mainly antioxidant components; particularly in hexane extracts, which were correlated with the antioxidant capacity. Highest mutagenesis inhibition (> 40%) occurred in R. riparium at the lowest concentration assayed (0.003 mg/plate), while highest antiproliferative inhibition (37 and 72% for 12.5 and 25 μg/mL) occurred in C. sertularioides. Discussion and conclusion Flavonoids and chlorophylls explained the chemopreventive activities assessed in S. filamentosa, R. riparium and C. sertularioides. These seaweeds have a high potential as a source of novel chemoprotectants. ",Is seaweed extracts mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
994,"In the neotropical savannah, Astronium species are used in popular medicine to treat allergies, inflammation, diarrhea and ulcers. Given that natural products are promising starting points for the discovery of novel potentially therapeutic agents, the aim of the present study was to investigate the mutagenic and antimutagenic activities of hydroalcoholic extracts of Astronium spp. The mutagenicity was determined by the Ames test on Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA97a, TA100 and TA102. The antimutagenicity was tested against the direct-acting and indirect-acting mutagens. The results showed that none of the extracts induce any increase in the number of revertants, demonstrating the absence of mutagenic activity. On the other hand, the results on the antimutagenic potential showed a moderate inhibitory effect against NPD and a strong protective effect against B[a]P and AFB1. This study highlights the importance of screening species of Astronium for new medicinal compounds. The promising results obtained open up new avenues for further study and provide a better understanding the mechanisms by which these species act in protecting DNA from damage. However, further pharmacological and toxicological investigations of crude extracts of Astronium spp., as well as of its secondary metabolites, are necessary to determine the mechanism(s) of action to guarantee their safer and more effective application to human health.

995,"In vitro cytotoxicity and genotoxicity induction by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) from maize (ME) and tortillas (TE) produced by microwave nixtamalization were investigated in monkey kidney (Vero cells) using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, the induction of lipid peroxidation, the oxidative damage by means of glutathione (GSH) depletion, and the Salmonella-microsomal screening system (Ames test). Our results showed that, at higher concentrations, both ME and TE extracts that contained varying amounts of aflatoxin caused a considerable decrease in Vero cell viability (up to 37%) after 4 h of exposure. Aflatoxins from ME induced greater oxidative damage by enhancing lipid peroxidation (up to 6.05 ± 0.14 μmol/mg protein) as compared to TE; however, TE also induced significant malondialdehyde formation in particular at the higher aflatoxin concentration tested (up to 2.7 ± 0.19 μmol/mg protein). The decrease in GSH level was also more pronounced in ME as compared to TE. Moreover, the Ames test results indicated that the mutagenic activity of TE was greatly reduced compared with that of ME based on his(-) → his(+) reversions in the Salmonella TA100 strain. According to these results, it is concluded that the microwave nixtamalization procedure reduced aflatoxins and their in vitro toxicity and mutagenic activity.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
996,"In this article, the genotoxic and antigenotoxic effects of methanol extract of of Cladonia foliacea (Huds.) Willd. (CME) were studied using WP2, Ames (TA1535 and TA1537), and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test systems. The results of our studies showed that 5 µM concentration of aflatoxin B1(AFB1) changed the frequencies of SCE and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. When 5 and 10 µg/mL concentrations of CME was added to AFB1, the frequencies of SCE and MDA level were decreased and SOD, GSH, and GPx levels were increased. The extract CME did not show any mutagenicity on Ames (Salmonella typhimurium TA1535, TA1537) and WP2 (Escherichia coli) test systems. On the other hand, CME has antimutagenicity on the mentioned test systems. The results of this experiment have clearly shown that CME has a significant antioxidative and antigenotoxic effect, which is thought to be due to the antigenotoxic activities of antioxidant enzymes.",Is CME mutagenic for TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
997,"The possible benefits of some bioactive flavones and xanthones present in plants of the genus Syngonanthus prompted us to screen them for estrogenic activity. However, scientific research has shown that such substances may have undesirable properties, such as mutagenicity, carcinogenicity and toxicity, which restrict their use as therapeutic agents. Hence, the aim of this study was to assess the estrogenicity and mutagenic and antimutagenic properties. We used recombinant yeast assay (RYA), with the strain BY4741 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Ames test, with strains TA100, TA98, TA97a and TA102 of Salmonella typhimirium, to evaluate estrogenicity, mutagenicity and antimutagenicity of methanolic extracts of Syngonanthus dealbatus (S.d.), Syngonanthus macrolepsis (S.m.), Syngonanthus nitens (S.n.) and Syngonanthus suberosus (S.s.), and of 9 compounds isolated from them (1=luteolin, 2=mix of A-1,3,6-trihydroxy-2-methoxyxanthone and B-1,3,6-trihydroxy-2,5-dimethoxyxanthone, 3=1,5,7-trihydroxy-3,6-dimethoxyxanthone, 4=1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxy-2,5-dimethoxyxanthone, 5=1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxy-5-methoxyxanthone, 6=7-methoxyluteolin-8-C-β-glucopyranoside, 7=7-methoxyluteolin-6-C-β-glucopyranoside, 8=7,3'-dimethoxyluteolin-6-C-β-glucopyranoside and 9=6-hydroxyluteolin). The results indicated the estrogenic potential of the S. nitens methanol extract and four of its isolated xanthones, which exhibited, respectively, 14.74±1.63 nM; 19.54±6.61; 7.20±0.37; 6.71±1.02 e 10.01±4.26 nM of estradiol-equivalents (EEQ). None of the extracts or isolated compounds showed mutagenicity in any of the test strains and all of them showed antimutagenic potential, in particular preventing mutations caused by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). The results show that the xanthones, only isolated from the methanol extract of S. nitens capitula, probably were the responsible for its estrogenic activity and could be useful as phytoestrogens, providing a new opportunity to develop hormonal agents. In addition, flavones and xanthones could also be used as a new antimutagenic agent.

Many positive results were obtained in these previous research. Thus, in this study, we aimed to determine whether extracts of Usnea articulata (UAE) and Usnea filipendula (UFE) possessing a protection against aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-induced genotoxic and oxidative damage. The results of our studies showed that 5 μM concentrations of AFB1 increased the frequencies of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). However, when 5, 10 and 20 µg/mL concentrations of UAE and UFE was added to AFB1, the frequencies of SCE and MDA level were decreased and SOD, GSH and GPx level were increased. The Ames (Salmonella typhimurium TA1535, TA1537) and WP2 (Escherichia coli) test systems carried out evinced that UAE and UFE possess any mutagenicity, but have antimutagenic effects. Consequently, the results of this experiment have clearly shown that UAE and UFE have strong antioxidative and antigenotoxic effects that are associated with its antioxidant nature.

999,"Using the Ames bacterial mutagenicity test, the comet assay, and an in vivo micronucleus test, we investigated the effect of the chemoprotective substance phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) on the mutagenic activity of indirect-acting mutagens and carcinogens aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), and direct-acting mutagen and carcinogen N-nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU). In the Ames test, the antimutagenic activity of PEITC was studied in the concentration range 0.3-300 microg/plate. PEITC at concentrations of 0.3, 3 and 30 microg/plate reduced dose-dependently mutagenicity of AFB1 and IQ in both S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains. In the case of the direct mutagen MNU, the antimutagenic effect of PEITC was detected only at concentration of 30 microg/plate in the strain TA100. The PEITC concentration 300 microg/plate was toxic in the Ames test. The 24 h pre-treatment of HepG2 cells with PEITC at concentration 0.15 microg/ml resulted in a significant decrease of DNA breaks induced by MNU at concentrations 0.25 and 0.5 mM. Although a trend towards reduced strand break level were determined also at PEITC concentrations 0.035 and 0.07 microg/ml it did not reach the statistical significance. No effect, however, of PEITC on IQ-induced DNA breaks was observed. Chemopreventive effect of PEITC was revealed also in vivo. Pretreatment of mice with PEITC concentrations of 25 and 12.5 mg/kg b.w. administered to mice in three daily doses resulted in reduction of micronucleus formation in mice exposed to all three mutagens under study, with statistically significant effect at concentration of 25 mg/kg. Results of this study indicate that the strong PEITC antimutagenic properties may have an important role in the prevention of carcinogenesis and other chronic degenerative diseases that share some common pathogenetic mechanisms.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

This study aimed to determine the levels of lutein and protein in corn before and after ozonation and to verify the antimutagenic potential of the extracted lutein against aflatoxin using the Ames test. The lutein content was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Nitrogen analysis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were used to analyze protein. Clean ozone-treated corn had a total lutein content of 28.36 microg/g, which was higher than that of 22.75 microg/g in the untreated clean corn. However, the lutein content was 11.69 microg/g in the ozone-treated contaminated corn, which was lower than that of 16.42 microg/g in the untreated contaminated corn. In both corn samples, the protein content of ozone-treated corn was lower than that of untreated corn, indicating that protein could be destroyed by the ozonation process, which may influence the nutritious value of the corn. Lutein extracts alone showed no mutagenic potential against Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA100. Lutein extracts from corn inhibited the mutagenicity of AFB1 in a dose-response manner more efficiently than lutein standard. Lutein extracts from different corn samples had similar antimutagenic potentials against AFB1, so the ozone treatment did not affect the antimutagenic potentials of lutein extracts.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1001,"Mutagenic and antimutagenic activities against direct acting mutagens, nifuroxazide (NF) and sodium azide (SA), and indirect acting mutagen aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) of extracts prepared from aerial parts of Pituranthos tortuosus were investigated in bacterial assay systems (i.e., the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA100, TA98, TA1538, TA1535, and the SOS chromotest with Escherichia coli PQ 37). It was found that all extracts obtained from P. tortuosus decreased the mutagenicity induced by AFB1 (10 microg/assay), SA (1.5 microg/assay), and NF (20 microg/assay). Ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol, and total oligomer flavenoid extracts exhibited the highest inhibition level of mutagenicity induced by the indirect mutagen AFB1. In addition, antiproliferative and apoptotic properties of these extracts have also been reported using two leukemia cell lines, L1210 and K562.

The objective of this work was to study the relationship among antimutagenicity, antioxidant and enzymatic activities of methanolic extract and trolox by principal components multivariate analysis. Antimutagenicity of phenolic compounds present in methanolic extract from the seed coat of common beans (P. vulgaris, Flor de Mayo Bajío cultivar) and trolox against AFB1 mutagenicity were evaluated in the Salmonella typhimurium microsuspension assay. Antioxidant capacity of methanolic extract and trolox were evaluated using beta-carotene and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) in vitro model assays. Cythrome P450 activity was measured by fluorometric assay. For phenolic extract, trolox and phenolic extract+trolox, the inhibition on AFB1 mutagenicity in tester strain TA100 was 47, 59 and 69%, respectively. While in TA98 was 39, 48 and 68%. The inhibition of phenolic compounds, trolox and phenolic compounds+trolox on cytochrome P450 (CYP450) activity was 48, 59 and 88%, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that phenolic extract and trolox have high antimutagenic and antioxidant activity and also inhibited enzymatic activity.

A first assay was performed by the plate incorporation procedure and a confirmation test by the pre-incubation method. In either test, no increase in the number of his(+) revertant colonies over the negative (solvent) control values was noted with any of the four tester strains thereby indicating that BIO was not genotoxic in the Salmonella assay. Antimutagenic activity was investigated by testing (by the plate incorporation method) different non-toxic doses of BIO against one or more non-toxic doses of direct-acting (sodium azide: SA, 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide: 4-NQNO, 2-nitrofluorene: 2-NF and nitro-o-phenylenediamine: NPD) as well as indirect-acting (cyclophosphamide: CP, benzo[a]pyrene: B[a]P, aflatoxin B1: AFB1, 2-aminoanthracene: 2-AA, and 2-aminofluorene: 2-AF) mutagens. BIO did not alter the effects of any direct-acting mutagen or B[a]P and 2-AF. Mutagenic effects of AFB1 and CP, however, were markedly and dose-dependently antagonized by BIO. It has been reported that, in the rat liver, activation of B[a]P and 2-AF depend on CYP1A1 activity, and that CYP2B subfamily is involved in the metabolic activation of CP and AFB1. It has also been described that BIO is a potent inhibitor of CYP2B1/2 and a weaker inhibitor of CYP1A1. Therefore, antagonism of CP-and AFB1-induced mutagenic effects by BIO could have been mediated-at least in part-by the inhibition of CYP2B enzymes.",Is nitro-o-phenylenediamine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
1006,"The hot water extract of the herbal tea, Gynostemma pentaphyllum Makino, was not found to be mutagenic in Salmonella mutation assay with or without metabolic activation. However, the extract had both DT-diaphorase inducing activity in the murine hepatoma (Hepa1c1c7) cell line and antimutagenic properties towards chemical-induced mutation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. Mutagenicity of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido [1, 2-a: 3', 2', 3-d] imidazole (Glu-P-1), 2-aminodipyrido [1, 2-a: 3', 2', 3-d] imidazole (GIu-P-2), 2-amino-1, 4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido [4, 3-b] indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido [4, 3-b] indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo [4, 5-f] quinoline (IQ) and Benzo [a] pyrene (B[a]P) was inhibited by the extract of Gynostemma pentaphyllum Makino in a dose-dependent manner, but no effect was found on the mutagenic activity of 2-(2-Furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (AF-2). However, the extract enhanced the mutagenicity induced by 2-aminoanthracene (2AA), and N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG).",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1007,"The fate of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a mycotoxin known to occur in polished rice, during rice cooking was evaluated to determine reduction in AFB1 residues and mutagenic potentials. The amounts of AFB1 in three lots of naturally contaminated polished rice from Korea were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography after washing and after steaming. An in vitro mutagenicity assay with Salmonella Typhimurium TA100 was used to confirm the results of the chemical analyses. Cooking significantly reduced AFB1 (mean reduction, 34%) in naturally contaminated polished rice and reduced mutagenicity by ca. 27%. Processing factors (reflecting the removal of AFB1 residues during processing) for cooked rice were estimated at 0.66 to 0.73, as determined chemically and toxicologically, respectively. The revised Korean provisional daily intake of AFB1 from consumption of rice as a dietary staple (0.58 to 3.94 ng/kg of body weight per day) is still higher than that reported for foods in general in the United States (0.26 ng/kg of body weight per day). Thus, Koreans probably consume higher amounts of foodborne AFB1 than do Americans and thus are at higher risk for AFB1-induced health consequences.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1008,"alpha-Bisabolol (BISA) is a sesquiterpene alcohol found in the oils of chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) and other plants. BISA has been widely used in dermatological and cosmetic formulations. This study was undertaken to investigate the mutagenicity and antimutagenicity of BISA in the Salmonella/microsome assay. Mutagenicity of BISA was evaluated with TA100, TA98, TA97a and TA1535 Salmonella typhimurium strains, without and with addition of S9 mixture. No increase in the number of his+ revertant colonies over the negative (solvent) control values was observed with any of the four tester strains. In the antimutagenicity assays, BISA was tested up to the highest nontoxic dose (i.e. 50 and 150 microg/plate, with and without S9 mix, respectively) against direct-acting (sodium azide, SA; 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, 4-NQNO; 2-nitrofluorene, 2-NF; and nitro-o-phenylenediamine, NPD) as well as indirect-acting (cyclophosphamide, CP; benzo[a]pyrene, B[a]P; aflatoxin B1, AFB1; 2-aminoanthracene, 2-AA; and 2-aminofluorene, 2-AF) mutagens. BISA did not alter mutagenic activity of SA and of NPD, and showed only a weak inhibitory effect on the mutagenicity induced by 4-NQNO and 2-NF. The mutagenic effects of AFB1, CP, B[a]P, 2-AA and 2-AF, on the other hand, were all markedly and dose-dependently reduced by BISA. It was also found that BISA inhibited pentoxyresorufin-o-depentylase (PROD, IC50 2.76 microM) and ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD, 33.67 microM), which are markers for cytochromes CYP2B1 and 1A1 in rat liver microsomes. Since CYP2B1 converts AFB1 and CP into mutagenic metabolites, and CYP1A1 activates B[a]P, 2-AA and 2-AF, results suggest that BISA-induced antimutagenicity could be mediated by an inhibitory effect on the metabolic activation of these promutagens.",Is 4-NQNO mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
1009,"Influence of grapefruit juice intake on aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-induced liver DNA damage was examined using a Comet assay in F344 rats given 5 mg/kg AFB1 by gavage. Rats allowed free access to grapefruit juice for 5 days prior to AFB1 administration resulted in clearly reduced DNA damage in liver, to 65% of the level in rats that did not receive grapefruit juice. Furthermore, rats treated with grapefruit juice extract (100 mg/kg per os) for 5 days prior to AFB1 treatment also reduced the DNA damage to 74% of the level in rats that did not receive grapefruit juice. No significant differences in the portal blood and liver concentrations of AFB1 were observed between grapefruit juice intake rats and the controls. In an Ames assay with AFB1 using Salmonella typhimurium TA98, lower numbers of revertant colonies were detected with hepatic microsomes prepared from rats administered grapefruit juice, compared with those from control rats. Microsomal testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation was also lower with rats given grapefruit juice than with control rats. Immunoblot analyses showed a significant decrease in hepatic CYP3A content, but not CYP1A and CYP2C content, in microsomes of grapefruit juice-treated rats than in non-treated rats. No significant difference in hepatic glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and glutathione content was observed in the two groups. GSTA5 protein was not detected in hepatic cytosol of the two groups. In microsomal systems, grapefruit juice extract inhibited AFB1-induced mutagenesis in the presence of a microsomal activation system from livers of humans as well as rats. These results suggest that grapefruit juice intake suppresses AFB1-induced liver DNA damage through inactivation of the metabolic activation potency for AFB1 in rat liver.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1010,"The MeOH extract of Pueraria thunbergiana (Leguminosae) flowers and its fractions were subjected to Ames test to test the antimutagenicity. EtOAc fraction (1 mg/plate) decreased the number of revertants of Salmonella typhymurium TA100 by 95% against aflatoxin B, (AFB1). Phytochemical isolation of the EtOAc fraction afforded four isoflavonoids (tectorigenin, glycitein, tectoridin and glycitin) and one saponin (kaikasaponin III). Though the three isoflavonoids other than tectoridin showed significant antimutagenicity, the activity of kaikasaponin III was the most potent. Kaikasaponin III (1 mg/plate) decreased the number of revertants of S. typhymurium TA100 by 99% against AFB, but by 75% against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Tectorigenin (1 mg/plate) inhibited the AFB1-induced mutagenicity by 90% and MNNG-induced one by 76%. Glycitein and glycitin were less active than tectorigenin and kaikasaponin III. This result suggested that kaikasponin III prevents the metabolic activation of AFB1 and scavenge electrophilic intermediate capable of mutation. The two components with potent activities, tectorigenin and kaikasaonin III, significantly prevented the malondialdehyde formation caused by bromobenzene in the rat.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1011,"Polyphenols with antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic properties are present in fruits, vegetables and legumes. In this study, the Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98 and TA100 were used in the microsuspension assay to examine the antimutagenic effect of phenolic compounds extracted from the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) against mutagenicity induced by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). A dose-response curve was constructed for AFB1; from which a level of 40 ng AFB1/tube was selected for all antimutagenicity assays. The AFB1 and phenolic extract (PE) were not toxic to the bacteria at concentrations tested. In the case of PE, results were similar to the number of spontaneous revertants for TA98 and TA100. The inhibitory effect of PE against AFB1 mutagenicity was dose-dependent at the lower concentrations tested (2.5, 5, 10, 12.5, 15 and 25 microgram-equivalent (+)-catechin/tube for TA98; 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 5, 10 and 25 microgram-equivalent (+)-catechin/ tube for TA100). Further, a two-stage incubation procedure was used to investigate the potential interaction between PE and AFB1. The greatest inhibitory effect of the PE on AFB1 mutagenicity occurred when PE and AFB1 were incubated together. When the bacteria were first incubated with PE followed by a second incubation with AFB1, lower inhibition was observed. Lower inhibition was also observed when the bacteria were first incubated with AFB1 followed by a second incubation with PE. The results suggest that the mechanism of inhibition could involve the formation of a chemical complex between of PE and AFB1.",Is PE mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1012,"Hericium erinaceus is valuable in the diet and in medical treatment. It contains water-soluble polysaccharides that have been found to enhance immunity and which show anti-artificial pulmonary metastatic tumor effects. In this study, water and ethanol extracts of the mycelium and fruiting body of Hericium erinaceus were examined by the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 to screen for antimutagenic effects against 5 mutagens: AFB1, B[a]P, Glu-P-1, NQNO, and Trp-P-1. We found that both extracts have the strongest antimutagenic activity against Trp-P-1, followed by Glu-P-1, B[a]P-1, AFB1, and finally NQNO. In addition, the antimutagenicity of the extracts was produced in a concentration-dependent manner. At a concentration of 200 ppm, both extracts showed the highest inhibitory action. However, the linear correlation indicated that concentration-activity relationship was not significant (p > 0.05). In addition, extracts showed less antimutagenicity after heat treatment (p < 0.05). This suggests that the antimutagenicity of the extracts is heat-labile. The ethanol extract from mycelium or fruiting body had better antimutagenic effects than did the water extract (p < 0.05). Also, the extract from the fruiting body had better antimutagenic effects than did that from the mycelium.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1013,"Most animal genotoxicity studies have used exposures to single chemicals; humans, however, are potentially exposed to mixtures of genotoxins. Cancer and developmental toxicity risks associated with genotoxins in mixture are generally estimated by assuming additivity of the components. Two or more genotoxins acting sequentially or simultaneously may present a greater or lesser hazard than that predicted by simple addition of their potencies. Previously, we studied the effect of one genotoxin on the binding of a second genotoxin to DNA in an in vitro system and demonstrated that consecutive binding of the two toxins was not additive. In the present study, the effect of one genotoxin on the mutagenicity of another was evaluated for two well-known genotoxins using the Salmonella assay. Pretreatment of frameshift strains TA98 and TA1538 with AFB1-8,9-epoxide (17.3 ng/plate) enhanced the mutagenicity induced by subsequent exposure to N-acetoxy-acetylaminofluorene (N-AcO-AAF) approximately 2-3 times above theoretical values for additivity. Pretreatment of base-substitution strain TA100 with N-AcO-AAF (0.1 microg/plate) inhibited the mutagenicity following subsequent exposure to AFB1-8,9-epoxide by 3 times below the theoretical additive value. Concentration-response relationships for these enhancing or inhibitory effects were demonstrated using increasing concentrations of the first genotoxin during pretreatment. These results demonstrate effects, other than additive, of sequential exposures to two genotoxins on the induction of mutations in a bacterial system.","Is AFB1-8,9-epoxide mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?",True
1014,"CYP3A7-M10 mouse is a transgenic mouse carrying human CYP3A7 cDNA, in which CYP3A7 is expressed in the small intestine but not in the kidney. HITEC mouse is a transgenic mouse developed to detect mutagenic potency of various chemicals in vivo. The M10/HITEC mouse was established by crossmating of these two strains of mice. When a 9,000 x g supernatant fraction prepared from the small intestine was added to an incubation mixture for Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 strain to examine the mutagen-producing activity from aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), the mutagen-producing activities of the 9, 000 x g supernatant fraction from the small intestine was found to be 1.7-fold higher in the M10/HITEC mice than in HITEC mice. Such a difference in the capacity to activate AFB1 was not seen with the 9, 000 x g supernatant fraction from the kidney from both strains of mice. Male M10/HITEC mice of 8 weeks old were treated with a single i.p. injection of AFB1 ( 8 mg/kg body weight). The mutation of the introduced rpsL gene in the genomic DNA from the small intestine and the kidney was analyzed. The mutation frequency in the small intestine of M10/HITEC mice was significantly higher (p<0.05) than that of HITEC mice, while the mutation frequency in both strains was similar in the kidney. These results provide the first evidence for the toxicological function of CYP3A7 in vivo.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1015,"Fifteen kinds of commonly consumed Thai vegetables were sequentially extracted with hexane, chloroform and methanol, and then tested for antimutagenic activities against direct-acting (AF-2 and NaN3) and indirect-acting (AFB1 and B(a)P) mutagens using Ames' Salmonella mutagenicity test with Salmonella typhimurium TA100 as tester strain. It was found that only the methanol extract of neem leaves contain weak antimutagen inhibiting the mutagenicities of both direct-acting mutagens. Interestingly, all vegetables studied were found to contain chemical compounds, mainly nonpolar ones, capable of inhibiting the mutagenicity of AFB1, while only some vegetables contain chemical compounds capable of inhibiting the mutagenicity of B(a)P, which is also an indirect-acting mutagen. Studies on anticarcinogenic potentials demonstrated that Thai bitter gourd fruits, but not sweet basil leaves, at the concentration of 6.25% and 12.5% in the diet, partially inhibited DMBA-induced mammary gland carcinogenesis in female Sprague-Dawley rats when fed to the animals 2 weeks prior to DMBA. Results in the present study therefore demonstrated that most Thai vegetables contain antimutagens inhibiting the mutagenicity of some indirect-acting mutagen, particularly AFB1. The mechanism of their antimutagenicity may probably be the inhibition of the activity of metabolic-activating enzymes in rat liver homogenates. Very interestingly, our results clearly reveal that Thai bitter gourd fruits, which possess Phase II enzymes inducing property, as well as the ability to reduce Phase I enzyme activities in rat liver, contain some anticarcinogens or chemopreventive agents. However, sweet basil leaves that possess both Phase I and Phase II enzyme-inducing properties may not contain any anticarcinogen, at least against DMBA-induced mammary gland carcinogenesis.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1016,"Ellagic acid (EA) is a phenolic compound that exhibits both antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic activity in a wide range of assays in vitro and in vivo. It occurs naturally in some foods such as strawberries, raspberries, and grapes. In the previous work, we used the Salmonella microsuspension assay to examine the antimutagenicity of EA against the potent mutagen aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) using tester strains TA98 and TA100. Briefly, the microsuspension assay was approximately 10 times more sensitive than the standard Salmonella/microsome (Ames) test in detecting AFB1 mutagenicity, and EA significantly inhibited mutagenicity of all AFB1 doses in both tester strains with the addition of S9. The greatest inhibitory effect of EA on AFB1 mutagenicity occurred when EA and AFB1 were incubated together (with metabolic enzymes). Lower inhibition was apparent when the cells were first incubated with EA followed by a second incubation with AFB1, or when the cells were first incubated with AFB1 followed by a second incubation with EA alone, all with metabolic enzymes. The result of these sequential incubation studies indicates that one mechanism of inhibition could involve the formation of an AFB1-EA chemical complex. In the present study, we further examine the effect of EA on AFB1 mutagenicity, but without the addition of exogenous metabolic enzymes. We report the mutagenicity of AFB1 in the microsuspension assay using TA98 and TA100 without the addition of S9. Neither the concentrations of AFB1 (0.6, 1.2, and 2.4 microg/tube) nor the concentrations of EA (0.3, 1.5, 3, 10, and 20 microg/tube) were toxic to the bacteria. The results indicate that AFB1 is a direct-acting mutagen, and that EA inhibits AFB1 direct-acting mutagenicity.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1017,"Extracts, isolated through sequential fractionation and partition procedures described previously (Martinez et al. 1994) from aflatoxin-free corn and aflatoxin-contaminated corn with and without ammonia treatment, were investigated for mutagenic potential using the Ames test (TA 100 tester strain). 2-Aminofluorene (2-AF) and pure aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) were used as positive controls. Although TA100 showed mutagenic response to pure AFB1 at a dose of ca 10 ng/plate, all isolates tested from ammonia-treated aflatoxin-contaminated corn containing 7500 ng AFB1/g did not exhibit positive results in the Ames test. Additionally, isolates from non-ammonia-treated aflatoxin-contaminated corn failed to give positive mutagenic potentials. These results indicate that differences between the mutagenic potentials of pure aflatoxins and of aflatoxins in naturally-contaminated corn exist. CH2Cl2 extracts (the fractions containing aflatoxins) obtained from aflatoxin-contaminated corn with and without ammonia treatment were applied to preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) in an effort to separate aflatoxins and/or ammonia/aflatoxin reaction products from the ""unknown interfering materials' existing in the corn matrix. Each of the fractions separated by TLC was tested by the Ames test with S9 activation and none of them gave a mutagenic response to TA100. CH2Cl2 extracts in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) obtained from non-ammonia-treated aflatoxin-free corn were spiked with pure AFB1 and tested by TA100 with S9 activation. Again, no positive responses were observed. These findings provide further evidence of ""unknown interfering materials' in corn which may bind with aflatoxin and/or can be extracted by CH2Cl2 together with aflatoxin, and, therefore, block the mutagenic activity of aflatoxin in the Ames test. Those materials were not separated from the aflatoxins by the TLC technique used in the present study. Possible reasons and further studies required to evaluate this phenomenon are discussed.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1018,"The effects of dietary administration of diallyl sulfide (DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS) and allyl mercaptan (AM) on the genotoxicity of different chemicals were studied in two experimental systems: (i) measurement of hepatic DNA single-strand breaks induced in rats by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) or methylnitrosourea (MNU); (ii) mutagenicity of AFB1 or NDMA on Salmonella typhimurium TA100 using hepatic S9 from rats fed allyl sulfides as the activation system. All compounds strongly reduced hepatic DNA breaks induced by AFB1 and NDMA but did not modify the genotoxicity of MNU. In the Ames test, the mutagenicity of NDMA was strongly inhibited by hepatic S9 from rats fed either compound. The mutagenicity of AFB1 was also reduced but to a lesser extent. Such effects are likely related to the modulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes which play a key role in metabolic activation as well as detoxication of NDMA and AFB1.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1019,"DNA adduct formation assay (DAFA) was carried out to compare dose responses with the Ames test and chromosomal aberration test using aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). In the bacterial mutation test, AFB1 and BaP (0-1 microgram/plate) were all positive in TA97a and TA100 with dose-related revertants. However, the slopes of the dose-response curves were gradual (slope 0.55-3.73, r = .84-.98). In the chromosome aberration test, a significant increase in the percentage of chromosomal aberrations was obtained from male ICR mouse spleen cells treated with AFB1 and BaP, but a dose-related increase was insensitive (slope 0.09-0.23, r = .75-.78). The incidence of chromosomally aberrant spleen cells treated with BaP was significantly increased compared with AFB1. DAFA was performed in vitro with [3H]-AFB1 and [3H]BaP. These two carcinogens were able to induce genotoxicity and showed good dose-related increases in terms of DNA adduct formation (slope 0.78-1.28, r = 1.00). Coefficients of variation (CV) for the slope of each dose-response curve were much lower in DAFA in vitro (CV 15.09- 18.34%) than those in any other test (CV 19.69-99.33%, Ames test; 18.89-44.58%, chromosome aberration test). Furthermore, DAFA in vivo was performed to investigate organotropic DNA adduct formation and persistence in Sprague-Dawley rats ip or orally treated with AFB1 and BaP. DNA adducts were monitored for 48-96 h by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using corresponding monoclonal antibodies, 6A10 and 8E11. DAFA in vivo demonstrated that the liver and kidney might be the probable target organs for AFB1 with the highest formation and persistence of DNA adducts and the lung and liver for BaP regardless of the route of administration. The results suggest that DAFA in vitro could be useful for detecting genotoxic compounds, and DAFA in vivo should also be considered as a good alternative method for the screening of organ-specific chemical carcinogens.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True

Further, we used a two-stage incubation procedure that incorporates washing the bacterial cells free of the incubation mixture after the first incubation to investigate EA and AFB1 interaction. Three different concentrations of AFB1 (2.5, 5 and 10 ng/tube) were tested against five different concentrations of EA for TA98 and TA100. EA significantly inhibited mutagenicity of all doses of AFB1 in both tester strains with the addition of S9. EA alone was not mutagenic at the concentrations tested. The greatest inhibitory effect of EA on AFB1 mutagenicity occurred when EA and AFB1 were incubated together. Lower inhibition was apparent when the cells were first incubated with EA followed by a second incubation with AFB1, and also when the cells were first incubated with AFB1 followed by a second incubation with EA alone.

1022,"The conventional method of site-directed mutagenesis was used to develop two Salmonella strains, JK-1 and JK-2, for detecting frameshift mutagens. The JK-1 strain was derived from Salmonella typhimurium TA1537 strain transformed by a mutant construct. A guanosine nucleotide was inserted between nucleotide residues 312 and 313 of the beta-lactamase gene. The JK-2 strain was obtained by the same procedure, but a guanosine nucleotide in position 315 of the beta-lactamase gene was deleted. The strains were tested with ten frameshift mutagens and the revertants were selected by ampicillin resistance. Representative mutagens including 2-nitrofluorene (2-NF), 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF), 9-aminoacridine (9-AA), 2,7-diaminofluorene (2,7-DAF) and 2-methoxy-6-chloro-9-(3-(ethyl-2-chloro-ethyl)-aminopropylamino)acridine (ICR-170) were more potent in the JK-1 strain than the JK-2 strain, and the number of revertant colonies were dose related. Under the same conditions, the ampicillin test was more sensitive than the Ames test. Other types of compounds such as 2-methoxy-6-chloro-9-(2-chloroethylaminopropylamino)acridine (ICR-191), benzo[a]pyrene (BP), 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide (4-NQNO), hycanthone and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) were not as mutagenic to these new strains.

Mutagenicity of AFB1, Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2, Glu-P-1, Glu-P-2, IQ, MNNG and AF-2, was inhibited by the extract of lemon grass in a dose-dependent manner, but no effect was found on the mutagenic activity of benzo[a]pyrene.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1024,"The antimutagenic effects of 27 kinds of plant flavonoids on the mutagenicity of aflatoxin B1(AFB1) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine(MNNG) in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 were investigated. In the mixed applications of AFB1 (1 microgram/plate) with the flavonoids (300 micrograms/plate) in the presence of a mammalian metabolic activation system (S9 mix), chrysin, apigenin, luteolin and its glucoside, kaempferol, fisetin, morin, naringenin, hesperetin, persicogenin, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin showed the antimutagenic effect against AFB1 with more than 70% inhibition rate. A little or no antimutagenicities except flavone against MNNG (0.5 microgram/plate) were observed. For the antimutagenicity of the flavonoids on AFB1, the flavonoid structure that contains the free 5-, 7-hydroxyl group seemed to be essential. However, saturation of the 2,3-double bond or elimination of the 4-keto group did not affect the activity.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1025,"The abilities of different rabbit lung cell types to bioactivate aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) to a DNA-binding and mutagenic metabolite have been examined. Microsomes were prepared from centrifugal elutriation-enriched preparations of isolated rabbit lung cell types. The activation of [3H]AFB1 (5.0 or 200 microM), measured indirectly as covalent binding to calf thymus DNA, was concentrated in microsomes from the non-ciliated bronchiolar epithelial (Clara) cell-rich fractions (13-22 times the activity of whole lung microsomes). Microsomes from type II cell-rich fractions had minimal activity. Significant correlations were detected between the rates of microsomal DNA binding and the percentages of Clara cells in the fractions. Prior treatment of rabbits with the cytochrome P450 class 1A inducer beta-naphthoflavone had no significant effect on the microsomal activation of AFB1. In other experiments, intact, enriched isolated rabbit lung cells were incubated with AFB1 (0-1.5 microM) in a modification of the Ames mutagenicity assay, using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100. The ability to activate AFB1 to mutagenic metabolite(s) in this system was localized in Clara cell-rich fractions, with no significant activity being detected in other fractions. The results of these studies indicate that the biotransformation of AFB1 to DNA-binding and mutagenic metabolite(s) in rabbit lung is heterogeneous, and that the Clara cell is specifically implicated in this ability.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True

The assay used Salmonella typhimurium TA98 as an indicator of the mutagenicity and hepatic post-mitochondrial fractions (S-9) from male Sprague-Dawley rats as the activating system. All three fatty acids inhibited the mutagenicity of IQ without effect on the uptake of the active metabolites and/or on the DNA repair processes within the bacterial cell. The activation of three other food mutagens, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was also inhibited by these fatty acids.","Is 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline mutagenic for TA98 strain?",True
1027,"Hepatic microsomal fractions (microsomes) were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats. The effect of arachidonic acid on the conversion of the heterocyclic aromatic amine 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) to its genotoxic metabolites was investigated using a modified bacterial mutation assay (indicator: Salmonella typhimurium TA98). Arachidonic acid inhibited the mutagenicity of IQ without effect on the uptake of the active metabolites and/or on the DNA-repair processes within the bacterial cell.

1028,"The mechanism by which vitamin A prevents or delays in chemical carcinogenesis remains unclear. In the present study, we assess the suggestive role of vitamin A in the initiation phase of carcinogenesis. We have conducted a dose-effect relationship between vitamin A dietary intake and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) genotoxicity measured both in vitro and in vivo. Thus AFB1-induced mutagenesis in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was investigated and compared to AFB1-induced single-strand breaks (SSBs) in DNA of rat hepatocytes. Rats were fed ad libitum with diet containing 0, 5, 50 or 500 IU of retinyl palmitate for 8 weeks. The AFB1-treated rats were injected i.p. with 1 mg/kg body weight. In the Ames test conditions TA98 back-reversion was negatively correlated with the log of vitamin A concentration in liver S9 fractions from experimental groups. However, the activities of metabolizing enzymes which specifically activate or deactivate AFB1 were found to be significantly decreased in vitamin A-deficient animals and weakly modified in vitamin A-supplemented animals. For in vivo experiments, the DNA elution rate of both AFB1-treated and untreated rats was increased in vitamin A deficiency condition (+79% and +17% respectively) and was reduced with the higher vitamin A dietary level (-44% and -53% respectively). DNA damage measured in vivo showed a significant positive correlation with mutagenic activity measured in the Ames test. These results confirm that the vitamin A status of animals can influence AFB1 genotoxic activity in vitro and indicate that this phenomenon also occurs in vivo. Thus a similar mechanism may be considered for the protective action of vitamin A both in vitro and in vivo. However, this mechanism is unlikely to involve modulation of the microsomal enzyme system responsible for AFB1 metabolism. Therefore a protective mechanism at the cytosolic or nuclear levels may be suggested.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1029,"Ames test procedures were used to test 8 natural food extracts for their antimutagenic activity against the mutagenic activity induced in S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) or metabolic extracts from A. versicolor or A. ochraceus. The tested substances were extracted repeatedly with acetone. The revertants induced by AFB1, metabolic extracts of A. versicolor or A. ochraceus were significantly decreased when extracts of the 8 natural foods were added to the media. The results showed that these extracts had marked inhibitory effects on the mutagenic activity induced by AFB1 or metabolic extracts of the two molds and also suggested that antimutagenic substances were present in these natural foods. These experiments provide a scientific basis for the study of food substances for the prevention of carcinogenesis. It is considered that these 8 natural food extracts produce marked antimutagenic effects and are practically valuable in the field of chemoprophylaxis of liver cancer in humans.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1030,"Crude extracts and partially purified as well as purified fractions were prepared from three Thai medicinal plants, namely, Acanthus ebracteatus Vahl, Plumbago indica Linn, and Rhinacanthus nasuthus Kurz, and then tested for their mutagenic and antimutagenic potentials using the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test. All fractions tested were not mutagenic toward either strain TA98 or TA100 whether tested in the presence or absence of S-9 mix. Interestingly, however, various fractions--especially those extracted by organic solvents such as petroleum ether, hexane, and chloroform, as well as some purified compounds from these plants--could strongly inhibit the mutagenicity of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), an indirect mutagen, when tested in the presence of S-9 mix but not that of 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (AF-2), which does not require metabolic activation for its mutagenicity. Furthermore, these fractions could markedly inhibit the activity of rat liver aniline hydroxylase, which is one of the cytochrome-P450-mediated reactions. These results therefore suggest that these Thai medicinal plants contain an antimutagen(s) which inhibits chemical mutagenesis by inhibiting the enzyme activities necessary for activation of indirect mutagens/carcinogens. Identification as well as anticarcinogenicity of purified compounds of these plants are being investigated in our laboratory.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1031,"Chlorine gas was used to treat aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). The time-related exposure study showed that 4 ml (15 mg) pure chlorine gas caused about 90% destruction of 100 micrograms AFB1 within 10 min, at standard temperature and pressure. Four fluorescent reaction products were produced, two of which were identified as 8,9-dichloro-AFB1 and 8,9-dihydroxy-AFB1 (diol). The use of [14C]AFB1 confirmed the 90% destruction of the compound by chlorine gas. An increased destruction of AFB1 also occurred when an increased amount of chlorine gas was used. The mutagenic activity of the AFB1 sample treated for 10 min was reduced to about 5% of the untreated control using the Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the presence of a rat-liver S-9 mix. A similar time-related reduction in AFB1 toxicity after chlorine treatment was also achieved using the chicken embryo toxicity assay.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1032,"Emodin (1,6,8-trihydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone), an important aglycone found in natural anthraquinone glycosides frequently used in laxative drugs, was mutagenic in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome assay (Ames test) with a specificity for strain TA1537. The mutagenic activity was activation-dependent with an optimal amount of S9 from Aroclor 1254-treated male Sprague-Dawley rats of 20% in the S9 mix (v/v) for 10 micrograms emodin per plate. Heat inactivation of the S9 for 30 min at 60 degrees C prevented mutagenicity. The addition of the cytochrome P-448 inhibitor 7,8-benzoflavone (18.5 nmoles per plate) reduced the mutagenic activity of 5.0 micrograms emodin per plate to about one third, whereas the P-450 inhibitor metyrapone (up to 1850 nmoles per plate) was without effect. To test whether a metabolite binds covalently to Salmonella DNA, [10-(14)C]emodin was radiosynthesized, large batches of bacteria were incubated with [10-(14)C]emodin and DNA was isolated. [G-3H]Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was used as a positive control mutagen known to act via DNA binding. DNA obtained after aflatoxin treatment could be purified to constant specific activity. With emodin, the specific activity of DNA did not remain constant after repeated precipitations so that it is unlikely that the mutagenicity of emodin is due to covalent interaction of a metabolite with DNA. The antioxidants vitamin C and E or glutathione did not reduce the mutagenicity. Emodin was also negative with strain TA102. Thus, oxygen radicals are probably not involved. When emodin was incubated with S9 alone for up to 50 h before heat-inactivation of the enzymes and addition of bacteria, the mutagenic activity did not decrease. It is concluded that the mutagenicity of emodin is due to a chemically stable, oxidized metabolite forming physico-chemical associations with DNA, possibly of the intercalative type. In order to check whether an intact mammalian organism might be able to activate emodin to a DNA-binding metabolite, radiolabelled emodin was administered by oral gavage to male SD rats and liver DNA was isolated after 72 h. Very little radioactivity was associated with the DNA. Considering that DNA radioactivity could also be due to sources other than covalent interactions, an upper limit for the covalent binding index, CBI = (mumoles chemical bound per moles DNA nucleotides)/(mmoles chemical administered per kg body weight) of 0.5 is deduced. This is 10(4) times below the CBI of AFB1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Is Emodin mutagenic for TA102 or TA1537 strain?,True
1033,"The effects of glutathione (GSH) and the combination of GSH and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) on aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) mutagenesis in the Salmonella mutagenicity assay using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 were tested. Ten concentrations of AFB1 (0-1.0 micrograms/plate) were added to a liver microsomal homogenate (S9 mix) or to S9 mix containing GSH or S9 mix containing the combination of GSH + GST. One-third of the samples were plated directly. Two-thirds were incubated for 30 min at 37 degrees C prior to plating, and of those, half included bacteria. All samples were plated according to Ames et al [1975]. The results show that the addition of GSH and GSH + GST affected AFB1 mutagenesis by forming the AFB1-GSH conjugate and decreasing the availability of AFB1-8,9-epoxide. The effect of GST on GSH activity varied with the strain because of the different amounts of S9 mix used. The formation of the AFB1-GSH conjugate was verified by using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography for quantitation of AFB1 and detection of AFB1-GSH.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1034,"Aflatoxin B1 and some of its metabolites were released from water-soluble aflatoxin conjugates isolated from rat primary hepatocyte cultures and hydrolysed by enzymes (beta-glucuronidase and sulphatase), by acid or by a combination of both treatments. The presence of AFB1 in the hydrolysates was detected on TLC plates, or indicated indirectly by the Ames mutagenicity assay. The aflatoxin conjugates were not mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the presence of rat-liver S-9 mix. However, following enzymatic hydrolysis, the chloroform extract of the hydrolysate was highly mutagenic to the bacteria, indicating the presence of mutagenic AFB1. The conjugates AFB1-glucuronide and AFB1-sulphate are therefore produced from AFB1 in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes.",Is chloroform extract mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1035,"Mutagenic activity of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was followed in the Ames Salmonella/microsome test using liver S-9 from control and partially hepatectomized (PH) mice. The S-9 preparations from the PH mice were capable of inducing significantly greater AFB1 mutagenic activity to strain TA100 than S-9 preparations from either unoperated control, sham-operated control, or Aroclor 1254-induced mice. Increased activity was observed with S-9 preparations made at both 42 h and 148 h following PH.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1036,"Weanling male Fischer rats were fed a purified diet or diets containing 25% (w/w) freeze-dried ground beets or cabbage with or without 1 ppm aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) for 26 wk. In 3-7 wk the cabbage diet diminished, while the beet diet enhanced AFB1-induced plasma alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) elevation. When the experiment was extended to 42 wk by maintaining the animals on the purified (basal) diet for a further 16 wk the rats that had consumed AFB1 in the beet diet had 72 +/- 14 tumours/liver (mean surface diameter of tumours, 6.13 +/0 4.69 mm); animals that had been given AFB1 in the control diet had 30 +/- 16 tumours/liver (mean surface diameter, 4.36 +/- 3.16 mm); rats that had been given AFB1 in the cabbage diet had 13 +/- 5 tumours/liver (mean surface diameter, 4.28 +/- 2.89 mm). In the Salmonella/mammalian microsomal test, urine from rats fed AFB1 with beets caused significantly (P less than 0.05) more revertants in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 than did urine from rats fed AFB1 with purified or cabbage diets. The beet- and cabbage-containing diets had no effect on the plasma AFP concentration, hepatic tumorigenesis, or the mutagenicity of urine in rats receiving no AFB1. The evidence suggests that non-nutrient components of common vegetables may influence the response to chemical carcinogens, and that AFP determinations are useful in the rapid identification of dietary factors that modify carcinogenesis.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1037,"Mutagenic activity of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was followed in the Ames Salmonella/microsome test using liver S-9 from uninfected and Fasciola hepatica infected mice. The S-9 preparations from parasite-infected animals were capable of inducing significantly greater AFB1 mutagenic activity to strain TA100 than S-9 preparations from either control, uninfected mice or Aroclor 1254-induced mice. The differences in activity between infected and uninfected mice were consistent between sex and strains of mice studied. The observed increase in biological activity was apparently due to an induction phenomenon in the host tissues rather than due to metabolism of AFB1 by F. hepatica enzymes.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1038,"The Ames assay employing Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98 was used to investigate potential interactions between aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and the phenolic antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyanisole, and propyl gallate. AFB1 doses were within the linear response range, and the antioxidants were used at levels of 0 to 50 micrograms per plate. All three antioxidants were nonmutagenic in either bacterial tester strain, with or without the hepatic S-9 enzyme preparation; toxic effects were observed at doses higher than 20 micrograms per plate. Butylated hydroxytoluene and butylated hydroxyanisole substantially increased AFB1-induced mutagenesis in the two tester strains with microsomal activation. The addition of 5 to 20 micrograms of butylated hydroxytoluene or hydroxyanisole to 5 to 20 ng of AFB1 per plate caused more than a twofold increase in the number of His+ revertants. Addition of propyl gallate resulted in only a moderate increase in the number of revertants. Whereas several anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic effects by phenolic antioxidants have been reported, particularly in studies with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the enhancement of mutagenic potency of AFB1 by these compounds suggests a specificity with respect to the chemical nature of AFB1.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1039,"Sprague-Dawley rats and Swiss mice were given diets containing lindane, 125 ppm, or zineb, 5200 ppm, or a mixture of both at the above-mentioned concentrations for 2 and 4 weeks. The effect of pesticide ingestion on the ability of liver S9 to metabolize aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) into mutagenic derivatives was tested by the Salmonella (TA100)/microsome test according to Ames. Control mouse-liver S9 was less efficient (13%) than the corresponding preparation from control rat liver. The ingestion of lindane produced a similar increase in the activities of both rat- (68%) and mouse-liver S9 (62%). Pretreatment with zineb inhibited (46%) rat-liver S9 but caused a marked increase (400%) in the activity of mouse-liver S9. Concomitant exposure to both pesticides showed that lindane released the inhibitory action of zineb on rat-liver S9 and reduced the stimulatory effect of zineb on mouse-liver S9. The inducing action of zineb in mice was a function of the dietary concentration of the pesticide. No effect was observed at dietary concentrations of zineb up to and including 500 ppm.",Is AFB1 mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1040,"An examination has been made of some of the parameters which can affect mutant numbers in the Salmonella/microsome assay. The type of minimal media plates used for the assay and the concentration of glucose-6-phosphate, one of the co-factors necessary for mono-oxygenase action, had no effect on mutant numbers. Increases in mutated bacteria resulted from the use of (1) log-phase bacteria, (2) higher NADP concentrations than those normally recommended, and (3) higher phosphate buffer concentrations. Six mutagens, i.e., 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF), 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine (3,3'-DCB), cyclophosphamide (CY), aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) and benzo[a]pyrene (BP), all requiring mono-oxygenase activation, were studied with two Salmonella typhimurium strains, TA98 and TA100, and liver preparations from rats given different inducing agent treatments using optimum conditions. Phenobarbitone induction was generally superior to Aroclor-1254 in converting these substrates to mutagens except for the polycyclic hydrocarbon substrates. A comparison of 3-methylcholanthrene, Aroclor-1254, beta-naphthoflavone or phenobarbitone as inducing agents revealed the first three of these to be equally effective in activating BP or 3MC to mutagens, whereas phenobarbitone was less active. Dual administration of 3-methylcholanthrene and phenobarbitone to rats did not result in an additive mutagenic effect using AAF, AFB1 or 3,3'-DCB as substrates, the numbers of mutant bacteria obtained being only equal to that seen with 3-methylcholanthrene alone. These differences were not due to there being different liver protein optima for the various inducing agent treatments. The foregoing results are discussed in relation to attempts to draw up a rigid protocol for mutagenicity testing.",Is 2-acetylaminofluorene mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1041,"This study evaluates mutagenic and antimutagenic effects of aqueous, total oligomers flavonoïds (TOF), ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from aerial parts of Cyperus rotundus with the Salmonella typhimurium assay system. The different extracts showed no mutagenicity when tested with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1538 either with or without the S9 mix. On the other hand, our results showed that all extracts have antimutagenic activity against Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in TA100 and TA98 assay system, and against sodium azide in TA100 and TA1535 assay system. TOF, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts exhibited the highest inhibition level of the Ames response induced by the indirect mutagen AFB1. Whereas, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts exhibited the highest level of protection towards the direct mutagen, sodium azide, induced response. In addition to antimutagenic activity, these extracts showed an important free radical scavenging activity towards the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical. TOF, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts showed IC(50) value of 15, 14 and 20μg/ml, respectively.

In this study, a bacterial reverse mutation assay with Salmonella Typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98, TA100, and TA102 and an in vitro chromosome aberration test with Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells were used to investigate the genotoxicity of water extract from Korean soybean paste (doen-jang [dwen-jahng]) and its antigenotoxic activity against aflatoxin B1. The water extract itself did not exhibit cytotoxicity or mutagenicity. The extract significantly reduced the numbers of revertants when it was added to the assay system with Salmonella Typhimurium TA100 (P < 0.05). The extract also exhibited significant inhibitory effects on chromosome aberration in CHL cells (P < 0.05). Dose-response relationships were observed between the concentration of the water extract and both its antimutagenic effect and its suppression of chromosome aberration.

1043,"The antimutagenic effects of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) prepared by heating three sugars (fructose, glucose and xylose) and four amino acids (arginine, glycine, lysine and tryptophan) at 100 degrees C for 10 hr was evaluated in the Salmonella/microsome assay. The highest extent of browning was found in the MRPs of sugars-lysine and xylose-amino acids. The MRPs of xylose-amino acids showed stronger antioxidative activity and reducing power than did the other combinations. No mutagenicity or toxicity in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was observed with any of the MRPs in the presence of S-9. Most MRPs, especially those of sugars-tryptophan and xylose-amino acids, strongly inhibited the mutagenicity of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoline (IQ), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyridol-(4,3-b)indole (Trp-P-1) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido(1,2-a:3',2'-d)imidazole (Glu-P-1) in the presence of S-9. However, the MRPs of fructose-glycine and fructose-arginine increased the mutagenicity of Trp-P-1. The antimutagenic effect of the MRPs was well correlated with their antioxidative activity and reducing power. The mutagenicity of benzo[a]pyrene was moderately inhibited by most MRPs, but was increased by the MRP of glucose-arginine. Aflatoxin B1 mutagenicity was increased greatly by all the MRPs except that of xylose-tryptophan. The findings suggested that MRPs might have a bifunctional property of co-mutagenicity and antimutagenicity in certain cases.",Is Aflatoxin B1 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

1046,"Synthetic dyes are released in wastewater from textile manufacturing plants, and many of these dyes are genotoxic. In the present study, the mutagenicity of azo, anthraquinone, and triphenyl methane dyes was investigated before and after successive biodegradation with activated sludge and the ligninolytic fungus, Irpex lacteus. Two biodegradation systems were used to reduce the genotoxicity of dyes that were not efficiently inactivated by activated sludge alone. Mutagenicity was monitored with the Salmonella reversion assay conducted with the base-pair substitution detector strains, TA100 and YG1042, and the frame-shift detector strains, TA98 and YG1041, with and without rat liver S9. All dyes except for Congo Red (CR) were mutagenic with S9 activation. Assays conducted with the dyes indicated that only the azo dye Reactive Orange 16 (RO16) was mutagenic in both TA98 and TA100. Methyl Red and Disperse Blue 3 (DB3) were mutagenic in TA98, YG1041 and YG1042, while Reactive Black 5 was mutagenic in YG1041 and YG1042. Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR), Crystal violet (CV) and Bromophenol Blue (BPB) were mutagenic only in TA98, but the toxicity of the latter two dyes complicated the evaluation of their mutagenicity. CR was not mutagenic in any of the tester strains. Biodegradation studies conducted with RO16 and DB3 indicated that the two-step biodegradation process reduced the mutagenic potential of RO16 and DB3 to a greater extent than activated sludge alone; the mutagenicity of the two dyes was reduced by 95.2% and 77.8%, respectively, by the two-step process.

1047,"The fungicide benomyl and its commercial preparations Fundazol 50WP and Benlate 50WP and the benomyl metabolite methyl-2-benzimidazole carbamate and its commercial preparation MBC 50WP were tested for mutagenicity in in vitro spot tests, in microsomal plate assay, in liquid-culture treatments, or in rodent host-mediated assay. The base-pair substitution Salmonella typhimurium mutant hisG46 and the hisG46-bearing uvrB excision-repair-deficient mutants TA100, TA1530, TA1535 or TA1950 were used as test organisms. Complete genotypic information of these mutants is given in Ames et al. [2]. Captain 50WP, streptozotocin (SZN), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), 2-aminopurine and N-acetylaminofluorene were used as positive control compounds. In nonoverlay spot tests Benlate 50WP was not mutagenic over a dose range of 50-5000 microgram/spot in hisG46 and TA1535. In overlay spot tests 50 or 100 microgram/spot Benomyl, MBC, Fundazol 50WP, Benlate 50WP and MBC 50WP were tested in hisG46, TA1530 or TA1950. Only a non-commercial MBC sample at 100 microgram/spot showed weak mutagenic activity in hisG46. In microsomal activation plate assay MBC, benomyl, Fundazol 50WP and Benlate 50WP were tested in TA100 over a dose range of 50-2000 microgram/plate. None of the compounds showed mutagenicity. In a 20-h liquid-culture treatment 10, 100, 1000 and 10 000 microgram/ml Fundazol 50WP were not mutagenic in TA 30. In 1-h liquid-culture treatments benomyl, Benlate 50WP or Fundazol 50WP failed to induce mutations in hisG46, TA100 or TA1950 over a dose range of 0.25-1000 microgram/ml. Appropriate positive controls were mutagenic in each experiment. The consistently negative results in this study with commercial MBC and benomyl preparations are contrary to positive results reported earlier with similar methods and similar commercial preparations. Possible reasons to explain the different results are presented. The alkylating agents SZN and MNNG induced fewer mutations in TA1530 and TA1950 uvrB excision-repair-deficient strains than in the hisG46 excision-proficient strain, indicating that with these mutagens excision-repair is also a mutation-prone process. In rodent host-mediated assays with Fundazol 50WP in mice 3 consecutive subcutaneous hourly doses of 500 mg/kg in hisG46 and TA1950 and in rats or mice an oral dose of 4000 mg/kg in TA1950 were not mutagenic.

1048,"1,1-Dichloropropene (1,1-DCPe) is a contaminant of some source waters used to make drinking water. Because of this and the fact that no toxicological data were available for this compound, which is structurally similar to the rodent carcinogen 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-DCPe), 1,1-DCPe was placed on the Contaminant Candidate List of the US Environmental Protection Agency. Consequently, we have performed a hazard characterization of 1,1-DCPe by evaluating its mutagenicity in the Salmonella assay and its DNA damaging (comet assay) and apoptotic (caspase assay) activities in human lymphoblastoid cells. In Salmonella, 1,1-DCPe was not mutagenic in strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA104 +/-S9 mix. However, it was clearly mutagenic in strain RSJ100, which expresses the rat GSTT1-1 gene. 1,1-DCPe did not induce DNA damage in GSTT1-1-deficient human lymphoblastoid cells, and it induced apoptosis in these cells only at 5 mM. Consistent with its mutagenesis in RSJ100, 1,1-DCPe reacted with glutathione (GSH) in vitro, suggesting an addition-elimination mechanism to account for the detected GSH conjugate. 1,1-DCPe was approximately 5000 times more mutagenic than its ethene congener 1,1-dichloroethylene (1,1-DCE or vinylidene chloride). Neither 1,1-DCE nor 1,3-DCPe showed enhanced mutagenicity in strain RSJ100, indicating a lack of activation of these congeners by GSTT1-1. Thus, 1,1-DCPe is a base-substitution mutagen requiring activation by GSTT1-1, possibly involving the production of a reactive episulfonium ion. This bioactivation mechanism of 1,1-DCPe is different from that of its congeners 1,1-DCE and 1,3-DCPe. The presence of 1,1-DCPe in source waters could pose an ecological or human health risk. Occurrence data for 1,1-DCPe in finished drinking water are needed to estimate human exposure to, and possible health risks from, this mutagenic compound.","Is 1,1-DCPe mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?",False
1049,"The charred surface of fish and beef showed strong mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium test strains when activated by S-9 mix of rat liver. The pyrolysis products of proteins and amino acids were also highly mutagenic. Among the pyrolysis products of amino acids, those of tryptophan, serine, and glutamic acid were most active. The new gamma-carboline derivatives, 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole, were purified from the pyrolysis products of tryptophan. These new compounds were stronger mutagens than aflatoxin B1 towards S. typhimurium TA98, a frameshift type mutant, and they also transformed cryopreserved Syrian hamster embryo cells in vitro. Tryptophan pyrolysate also contained the beta-carboline derivatives, norharman and harman, which are not mutagenic alone, but act as comutagens. A mixture of norharman or harman and nonmutagenic aniline or o-toluidine was strongly mutagenic. The mutagenicities of charred products of other foods, such as seaweed and garlic, are reviewed in this article. Flavonoids, such as kaempferol and quercetin, and glycosides of these flavonoles were mutagenic. The mutagenicity of cooked vegetables depends partly on these flavonoid derivatives. The already-known existence of benzol[a]pyrene and nitroso compounds in cooked food is also reviewed.","Is 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole mutagenic for TA98 strain?",True
1050,"Azaperone was evaluated for its mutagenic potential by the Salmonella/microsome test. No mutagenic activity towards six S. typhimurium strains could be evidenced with azaperone at doses up to 2,000 micrograms/plate, either without or with metabolic activation at usual test conditions. Higher concentrations of liver post-mitochondrial fraction from Aroclor 1254 (ARO)-pretreated rats did not reveal any increase in the number of revertants towards S. typhimurium strains TA1537, TA1538 and TA98. Moreover, a plate-incorporation test with liver post-mitochondrial fractions from mice pretreated with phenobarbital (PB) and a liquid preincubation test with liver post-mitochondrial fractions from rats pretreated with ARO also failed to reveal any mutagenic action of azaperone towards S. typhimurium strain TA98. Thus, none of the tests used provided any indication of azaperone having a mutagenic action.",Is Azaperone mutagenic for TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
1051,"In order to detect possible mutagenic substances in pyrolysate obtained by burning polyvinyl chloride product (PVC-P) at approximately 1000 degrees C, mutagenicity of rough extracts obtained by extraction with various solvents for the products was investigated by means of reversion mutation assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 with or without microsomal metabolic activation (S9 mix). Strong mutagenicity in TA98 without S9 mix was observed in acetone-extract of PVC-P. The extract was fractionated into acidic, neutral and basic by liquid-liquid distribution and the mutagenicity in TA98 without S9 mix was found in the neutral fraction. Identification of mutagenic substances in the neutral fraction from acetone extract, which showed the strongest mutagenicity, was attempted by means of thin layer chromatography and capillary gas chromatography. The results suggest that mutagenic substances from pyrolysate of PVC-P are benzanthrone and an isomer of benzo(c)cinnoline. The results also suggest that burning wastes containing plastic products is not always safe even if at 1000 degrees C and further research on the problem is necessary.",Is PVC mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1052,"Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 were used to assess the mutagenic potential of the aerosol from a commercially available, rechargeable, closed system electronic-cigarette. Results obtained were compared to those for the mainstream smoke from a Kentucky reference (3R4F) cigarette. Two different test matrices were assessed. Aerosol generated from the e-cigarette was trapped on a Cambridge filter pad, eluted in DMSO and compared to cigarette smoke total particulate matter (TPM), which was generated in the same manner for mutagenicity assessment in the Salmonella assay. Fresh e-cigarette and cigarette smoke aerosols were generated on the Vitrocell ®  VC 10 smoking robot and compared using a modified scaled-down 35mm air agar interface (AAI) methodology. E-cigarette aerosol collected matter (ACM) was found to be non-mutagenic in the 85mm plate incorporation Ames assay in strains TA98 and TA100 conducted in accordance with OECD 471, when tested up to 2400μg/plate. Freshly generated e-cigarette aerosol was also found to be negative in both strains after an AAI aerosol exposure, when tested up to a 1L/min dilution for up to 3h. Positive control responses were observed in both strains, using benzo[a]pyrene, 2-nitrofluorene, sodium azide and 2-aminoanthracene in TA98 and TA100 in the presence and absence of metabolic activation respectively. In contrast, cigarette smoke TPM and aerosol from 3R4F reference cigarettes were found to be mutagenic in both tester strains, under comparable test conditions to that of e-cigarette exposure. Limited information exists on the mutagenic activity of captured e-cigarette particulates and whole aerosol AAI approaches. With the lower toxicant burden of e-cigarette aerosols compared to cigarette smoke, it is clear that a more comprehensive Ames package of data should be generated when assessing e-cigarettes, consisting of the standard OECD-five, TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 (or TA97) and E. coli (or TA102). In addition, TA104 which is more sensitive to the carbonyl based compounds found in e-cigarette aerosols under dry-wicking conditions may also prove a useful addition in a testing battery. Regulatory standard product testing approaches as used in this study will become important when determining whether e-cigarette aerosols are in fact less biologically active than cigarette smoke, as this study suggests. Future studies should be supported by in vitro dosimetry approaches to draw more accurate comparisons between cigarette smoke, e-cigarette aerosol exposure and human use.",Is ACM mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
1053,"Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1537, TA97, TA102 and TA104 were assessed for their suitability and use in conjunction with a Vitrocell(®) VC 10 Smoking Robot and 3R4F reference mainstream cigarette smoke. Little information exists on TA97, TA104, TA1535, TA1537 and TA102 using an aerosol 35mm spread-plate format. In this study, TA1535 and TA1537 were considered sub-optimal for use with a scaled-down format, due to low spontaneous revertant numbers (0-5 revertants/plate). In the context of a regulatory environment, TA97 is deemed an acceptable alternative for TA1537 and was therefore selected for whole smoke exposure in this study. However, there is no acceptable alternative for TA1535, therefore this strain was included for whole smoke exposure. TA1535, TA97, TA102 and TA104 were assessed for mutagenic responses following exposure to cigarette smoke at varying concentrations (using diluting airflow rates of 1.0, 4.0, 8.0 and 12.0L/min), and exposure times of 24 and 64min. A positive mutagenic response to cigarette smoke was observed in strain TA104 at both the 24 and 64min time points, in the presence of S-9, at the highest smoke concentration tested (1.0L/min diluting airflow). The three remaining strains were found to be unresponsive to cigarette smoke at all concentrations tested, in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Cigarette smoke particulate deposition was quantified in situ of exposure using quartz crystal microbalance technology, enabling data to be presented against an associated gravimetric mass (μg/cm(2)). Finally, data obtained in this study were combined with previously published Ames data for TA98, TA100, YG1024, YG1042 and Escherichia coli (WP2 uvrA pKM101), generated using the same 35mm methodology. The combined data-set was used to propose an aerosol testing strategy, based on strain compatibility with the whole smoke aerosol, whilst maintaining the essence of the regulatory guidelines for the standard Ames assay.

1054,"To date there are no widely accepted methods for the toxicological testing of complex gaseous mixtures and aerosols, such as cigarette smoke, although some modifications to the standard regulatory methods have been developed and used. Historically, routine testing of cigarettes has primarily focused on the particulate fraction of cigarette smoke. However, this fraction may not accurately reflect the full toxicity and mutagenicity of the smoke aerosol as a whole, which contains semi-volatiles and short-lived products of combustion. In this study we have used a modified version of the bacterial reverse-mutation (Ames) assay for the testing of mainstream smoke generated from 3R4F reference cigarettes with a Vitrocell(®) VC 10 exposure system. This method has been evaluated in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, YG1024 and YG1042) and one strain of Escherichia coli (WP2 uvrA pKM101) in the absence and presence of a metabolic activation system. Following exposure at four concentrations of diluted mainstream cigarette-smoke, concentration-related and reproducible increases in the number of revertants were observed in all four Salmonella strains. E. coli strain WP2 uvrA pKM101 was unresponsive at the four concentrations tested. To quantify the exposure dose and to enable biological response to be plotted as a function of deposited mass, quartz-crystal microbalances were included in situ in the smoke-exposure set-up. This methodology was further assessed by comparing the responses of strain YG1042 to mainstream cigarette-smoke on a second VC 10 Smoking Robot. In summary, the Ames assay can be successfully modified to assess the toxicological impact of mainstream cigarette-smoke. ",Is cigarette smoke mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or pKM101 strain?,True
1055,"To evaluate the genotoxic risk that contaminated sediment could constitute for benthic organisms, three contaminated (VA, VC and VN) and one uncontaminated (RN) sediment samples were collected in the Berre lagoon (France). Potentially bioavailable contaminants in sediments were obtained using sediment extraction with synthetic seawater adjusted to pH 4 or pH 6, simulating the range of pH prevailing in the digestive tract of benthic organisms. The genotoxic activities of these extracts were evaluated by three short-term bioassays: the Salmonella mutagenicity test using the Salmonella typhimurium strain TA102, the alkaline comet assay and the micronucleus assay on the Chinese Hamster Ovary cells CHO-K1. Results of the Salmonella mutagenicity assay detected a mutagenic response for RN extract at pH 6, and for VA extract at pH 4. Results of the comet and micronucleus assays detected low genotoxic/clastogenic activities for VA and VC extracts at pH 6 and higher activities for RN, VA and VC extracts at pH 4. To identify if metals (Al, Fe, Mn, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn) were involved in these genotoxic activities, their concentrations were determined in the extracts, and their speciation was assessed by thermodynamic calculations. Results showed that extracts from sites VA, VC and VN generally presented the highest trace metal contents for both extractants, while the site RN presented lower trace metal contents but the highest Fe and Mn contents. Thermodynamic calculations indicated that Fe, Mn, As and in a lower extend Co, Ni and Zn were mainly present under free forms in extracts, and were consequently, more likely able to induce a genotoxic effect. Results globally showed no correspondence between free metal contents and genotoxic activities. They suggested that these positive results could be due to uncharacterized compounds, acting as direct genotoxic agents or enhancing the genotoxic properties of analyzed metals.",Is RN mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True

VCP-IS-2Na was assayed with chemical mutagens, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (furylfuramide) and 4-nitroquinolin 1-oxide (4NQO), which do not require liver metabolizing enzymes. VCP-IS-2Na at a concentration of 0.40 micromol/ml suppressed 66.2%, 54.7% and 60.2% of the SOS-inducing activity on MNNG, furylfuramide, and 4NQO, and the 50% inhibitory dose value (ID(50)) was 0.12 micromol/ml, 0.26 micromol/ml, and 0.17 micromol/ml, respectively. In addition, VCP-IS-2Na was assayed with 2-aminoanthracene (2AA) and 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), which require liver metabolizing enzymes. To study the structure-activity relationship, L-ascorbic acid (VC) and VCP-Na were also assayed with all mutagens. VCP-IS-2Na, suppressed the chemical and physical mutagens-induced SOS response greater than VC and VCP-Na in the umu test. Also, the antimutagenic activities of VCP-IS-2Na, VC, and VCP-Na against MNNG and Trp-P-1 were assayed by the Ames test using the S. typhimurium TA100 strain. In summary, this research suggests that VCP-IS-2Na showed potent antimutagenic effects against chemical mutagens and UV irradiation.",Is VCP-IS-2Na mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
1057,"Previous studies showed that binary mixtures of the environmental pollutants 1- and 3-nitrobenzo[a]pyrene produced a synergistic mutational response in the Salmonella reversion assay. Since nitroreduction is believed to mediate the direct-acting mutagenicity of the individual compounds, we have examined the role of nitroreduction in the mutagenicity of mixtures of 1- and 3-nitrobenzo[a]pyrene in the Salmonella plate incorporation assay. While mixtures of 1- and 3-nitrobenzo[a]pyrene induced up to 183% more revertants in strain TA98 than produced by equivalent amounts of the individual compounds, in the nitroreductase-deficient strain TA98NR the same mixtures only induced up to 57% more revertants than the individual compounds. Analysis of mixtures of 1- and 3-nitrosobenzo[a]pyrene (the two-electron reduction products of 1- and 3-nitrobenzo[a]pyrene) for mutation induction in TA98 yielded no evidence of a synergistic effect between the compounds. The mutagenicity of the mixtures was dependent upon the amount of the more mutagenic component. Salmonella cultures were also incubated with mixtures of 1- and 3-nitrobenzo[a]pyrene, as well as with equivalent amounts of the individual compounds. In two experiments, nitroreductive ability, as measured by the amount of 1-nitropyrene metabolized to 1-aminopyrene in 1 hr, was increased 9 to 105% in cultures pretreated with the mixtures as compared with cultures pretreated with the individual compounds. The results of this study support the hypothesis that nitroreduction is a major factor in the synergistic mutational response induced by 1- and 3-nitrobenzo[a]pyrene in Salmonella typhimurium.",Is 3-nitrosobenzo[a]pyrene mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

The pyrolyzates are potent mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines formed during cooking. Solution of these amines was mixed with aqueous suspension of bacterial cells or dietary fibers, and removal of these amines from the reaction mixture by centrifugation was defined as the binding. Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 were effectively bound to all gram-positive and some gram-negative bacterial cells, corn bran, apple pulp, and soy bean fiber. Binding of Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and cellulose was moderate, and to chitin and chitosan it was little. None but corn bran bound Glu-P-1 and Glu-P-2 effectively. Corn bran effectively bound all mutagens tested. The quantity of the binding of IQ, MeIQ, and MeIQx was dependent on the strain of bacteria and the kind of fiber. The mechanism of binding of Trp-P-2 to freeze-dried feces, Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC9018), and corn bran was investigated. The binding was pH dependent, occurred instantaneously, and was inhibited by the addition of metal salts. These results indicate that the binding was mostly due to a cation-exchange mechanism, but some irreversible binding of Trp-P-2 was observed, most notably to freeze-dried feces. The mutagenicity of Trp-P-2 for Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of S9 mix was inhibited by the addition of LC9018 or corn bran to the reaction mixture. The results indicate that bound Trp-P-2 did not cause mutation under the assay conditions.","Is 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline mutagenic for TA98 strain?",True

Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 was used with and without metabolic activation (S9 mix). The anti-mutagenic properties was assayed with the following HCAs: 2-amino-3-methylimidazo-[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo-[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo-[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), the imidazoles 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido-[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1) and 2-aminodipirydo-[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-2). All HCAs with S9 induced mutagenicity at 10(-10) mol/plate. Without S9, IQ and MeIQ showed mutagenicity at 10(-8) mol/plate, MeIQx and Glu-P-1 at 10(-5) mol/plate, while Glu-P-2 was inactive. In presence of HACs (10(-9) mol/plate), C. lechleri essential oil was tested for mutagen-protective properties (concentration range: 0.01-0.10 mg/plate) taking the Highest Uneffective Dose (HUD) as threshold reference.

The antimutagens were purified chromatographically while monitoring the antimutagenic activity against Trp-P-2 with a modified Ames test employing a plate method. This purification resulted in the isolation of four strong antimutagens, 5,7-dihydroxy-6,3',4'-trimethoxyflavone (eupatilin), 5, 7,4'-trihydroxy-6,3'-dimethoxyflavone (jaceosidin), 5,7, 4'-trihydroxyflavone (apigenin) and 5,7, 4'-trihydroxy-3'-methoxyflavone (chrysoeriol) from the methanol extract. These antimutagenic flavones exhibited strong antimutagenic activity against not only Trp-P-2 but also against other heterocyclic amines, such as 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4, 3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3, 8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-3-methyl-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (MeA(alpha)C) in S. typhimurium TA98.

1065,"The TNO gastro-Intestinal tract Model (TIM) is a dynamic computer-controlled in vitro system that mimics the human physiological conditions in the stomach and small intestine. In the current TIM physiological parameters such as pH, temperature, peristaltic movements, secretion of digestion enzymes, bile and pancreatic juices, and absorption of digested products-by removal through dialysis-was simulated. Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAA; viz. IQ, MeIQ, MeIQx and PhIP) were used as model compounds for food mutagens, and the passage through TIM was investigated for each of these compounds separately. Subsequently, the influence of a matrix and different rates of passage on the availability for absorption and distribution were studied in experiments with prepared meat, supplemented with MeIQx. Samples taken at various time points from the jejunal and ileal dialysates and from the lumen at the end of the small intestine (ileal delivery) were tested for the presence of mutagenic activity in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 as indicator, in the presence of mammalian metabolic activation (rat S9 mix). The results show that, comparable with the human in vivo situation, all four HAA are quickly removed (approx. 50% in 2 hr; approx. 95% in 6 hr) and mainly recovered from the lumen into the jejunal and ileal dialysates (94% of recovery). Only 5+/-1.5% is recovered in the chyme at the end of the small intestine. When MeIQx was added to meat, its availability for absorption was slower, although the influence of the gastrointestinal passage time on the availability of MeIQx was more pronounced than this matrix effect. More MeIQx was found in the jejunal dialysate (23%; P<0.01) and less in the ileal delivery (8%; P<0.01) when simulating the gastrointestinal passage of solid meals was compared to simulating that of liquid meals. The present experiments demonstrate that TIM can be applied to study in vitro the availability of heterocyclic aromatic amines in the gastrointestinal tract. More generally, these studies indicate that TIM shows promise as a useful tool for various research purposes dealing with the availability for absorption of mutagenic as well as antimutagenic components in food.",Is MeIQ mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1066,"Mutagenicity, co-mutagenicity and anti-mutagenicity of glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) were examined by the Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 with S9. As pro-mutagens, 2-aminoanthracene (2AA), Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), 3-amino-1-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4, 3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4, 5-f]quinoline (IQ) and 2-amino-3, 4-dimethylimidazo[4, 5-f]quinoline (MeIQ) were used. In addition to these pro-mutagens, blue-chitin extracts of human gallbladder bile (BCE) collected from the cholecystectomized patients with cholelithiasis were used in order to investigate the role of GUDCA on mutagen(s) actually existing in human bile. It was found that GUDCA did not show mutagenicity in this test system. Concerning the modification of mutagenic activities of pro-mutagens, GUDCA showed the different directions. GUDCA acted as co-mutagen, since it enhanced the mutagenic activities of 2AA and BaP. But, acted as anti-mutagen, since it suppressed the activities of Trp-P-2, IQ and MeIQ, all of which were classified as heterocyclic amines. GUDCA also suppressed the mutagen(s) in human bile. Because of the use of blue-chitin absorbed method for testing bile mutagenicity, the chemicals involved were considered to be heterocyclic amines and other polycyclic compounds. In these we suspect the bile mutagens are heterocyclic amines. Further examination should be directed towards the investigation into the mechanism of anti-mutagenic effects of GUDCA on mutagen(s) actually existing in human bile.",Is GUDCA mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1067,"Airborne cooking by-products from frying beef (hamburgers), pork (bacon strips) and soybean-based food (tempeh burgers) were collected, extracted, tested for mutagenicity and chemically analysed. The fumes generated by frying pork and beef were mutagenic, with 4900 and 1300 revertants/g of food cooked, respectively. No mutagenicity was detected in fumes from frying tempeh burgers. Bacon fried to a well-done but non-charred state was eight times more mutagenic in a microsuspension Ames/Salmonella test (TA98 with S-9) than hamburgers and about 350 times more mutagenic than tempeh burgers. Among food samples cooked to a well-done, non-charred state, bacon strips had almost 15-fold more mass (109.5 ng/g) than that of the beef, whereas no heterocyclic amine (HCA) was detected in the fried tempeh burgers. 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) was the most abundant HCA, followed by 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx). No 2-amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (A alpha C) was detected in the food samples fried at about 200 degrees C, although it was present in the collected airborne products. The total amounts of HCAs in the smoke condensates were 3 ng/g from fried bacon, 0.37 ng/g from fried beef and 0.177 ng/g from fried soy-based food. This study indicates that cooks are potentially exposed to relatively high levels of airborne mutagens and carcinogens and that long-term sampling inside restaurants and kitchens may be warranted in order to assess the potential risk of prolonged exposure.",Is Bacon mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1068,"Prostaglandin H synthase (PHS) is widely distributed in mammalian tissues and has the ability to oxidize a variety of mutagens and carcinogens. It may therefore play a key role in the metabolic activation of xenobiotics. The present study documents that highly purified PHS can be used in conjunction with 5-phenyl-4-pentenyl-1-hydroperoxide (PPHP), a relatively stable and non-mutagenic hydroperoxide substrate, for the metabolic activation of aromatic amines to mutagenic derivatives that can be detected in short-term Salmonella typhimurium mutagenesis assays. The PHS-based activation system alone was not mutagenic for these tester strains, nor were the test compounds significantly toxic for the bacteria over the concentration range tested. When used in conjunction with Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100 in a modified Ames assay, this system should prove useful for screening of a wide range of compounds for metabolic activation by this mammalian peroxidase. The potential broad utility of this purified PHS-dependent metabolic activation system was investigated by evaluating the activation of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), which are representative of a group of mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic arylamines to which humans are exposed via their diet. Both IQ and MeIQ were activated by PHS to potent mutagens and confirm the utility of the PPHP/PHS system for the activation of premutagens. Whereas the extent of activation of aromatic amines by S9-based systems is significantly greater than for the PHS activation system described herein, PHS may play a significant role in target tissues in which it is present at significantly greater levels than P450 isoenzymes. Moreover, it is likely that the substrate specificity of PHS differs sufficiently from that of P450 isoenzymes so that PHS may activate some compounds that are not efficiently activated by mixed-function oxidase based systems.",Is PHS mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

The liquid preincubation method in the presence of strain TA98 was utilized. In order to understand the mechanism involved in this metabolic activation, some modulators were incorporated in the medium. The results suggest that an oxygenated hemoprotein, probably oxyhemoglobin, is involved in the activation into genotoxic intermediate(s).",Is MeIQ mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1070,"Heterocyclic aromatic amines, derived from the pyrolysis of amino acids and proteins, are potent mutagens in the Ames Salmonella assay with rodent liver activation. Additionally, heterocyclic aromatic amines are multipotent carcinogens. We report evidence that these compounds are substrates for the hydroperoxidase activity of prostaglandin H synthase, as measured by alterations in UV/visible spectra, and are bioactivated to macromolecule-reactive species by this enzyme. Indirect electron paramagnetic resonance studies indicate that this activation may occur via a one-electron mechanism. 2-Amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) are direct-acting mutagens in TA98. The mutagenicity of IQ and MeIQ, but not Trp-P-2, were enhanced by activation with ram seminal vesicle microsomes (a rich source of prostaglandin H synthase). Subsequent experiments utilized the newly constructed tester strain TA1538/1,8-DNP6 (pYG 121), which has enhanced arylamine N-acetyltransferase activity. In this strain IQ, MeIQ and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido-[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1) were mutagenic with ram seminal vesicle microsome activation. 3-Amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) was a weak direct-acting mutagen, and was not activated by the ram seminal vesicles (RSV) system. The responses of IQ and MeIQ were markedly enhanced in TA1538/1.8-DNP6 (pYG 121), relative to TA98. These data are consistent with the involvement of prostaglandin H synthase-catalyzed activation in heterocyclic aromatic amine-induced extrahepatic neoplasia.",Is MeIQ mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

The in vivo activation of the three mutagens was investigated in 4- and 24-week-old mice using an intrasanguineous host-mediated assay. All three compounds showed reduced levels of activation with the older hosts. Hepatic S9 fractions from female mice of varying ages between 2 and 24 weeks were used in the in vitro mutagenicity assay. To achieve optimal activation to bacterial mutagens, 5% S9 was required for aflatoxin B1 and Trp-P-2 and 10% S9 for MeIQ; age of donor generally had little effect on the profile of these protein activation curves. Under these optimal conditions MeIQ and Trp-P-2 both exhibited, as before, age-dependent decreases in activation over a wide range of mutagen concentrations, however the in vitro activation of aflatoxin showed no consistent change with age. Spectrophotometric measurements of S9 cytochrome P-450 content showed a decrease in concentration with increasing age, but this was not sufficient to account for changes observed in hepatic mutagen activation. However, changes in the activities of certain cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes and cytosolic GSH-transferases, which in turn result in changes in the activation and detoxification capacity of the liver, would appear to explain age-dependent changes in the activity of mutagens in vivo.",Is MeIQ mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

When incubated with uninduced (control) rat hepatocytes, both the acetylated and the unacetylated compounds appeared to be relatively stable, whereas water-soluble metabolites (i.e. not extractable by ethyl acetate at alkaline pH) were rapidly formed with hepatocytes from PCB-induced animals. No DNA damage was induced by IQ or MeIQ in hepatocytes isolated from control rats, as measured by alkaline elution. In hepatocytes from PCB-pretreated rats, IQ, MeIQ, AcIQ and AcMeIQ induced DNA damage at low (10(-6) M) concentrations, with AcIQ being more potent than IQ whereas AcMeIQ was less potent than MeIQ. Similar patterns were observed when unscheduled DNA synthesis was measured in hepatocytes. The compounds induced sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster V79 cells with PCB-induced hepatocytes as activation system; IQ and AcIQ were equal while AcMeIQ had less activity than MeIQ. The compounds were also compared in bacterial mutagenesis test systems (Salmonella typhimurium TA98). With hepatocyte activation, AcIQ was slightly more potent than IQ, whereas AcMeIQ was markedly less mutagenic than MeIQ. With subcellular fractions as activation system (rat liver S9 or microsomes), the N-acetylated compounds were similar to or less mutagenic than their parent compounds.

1073,"The umu test system is a newly developed method to evaluate genotoxic activities of a wide variety of environmental carcinogens and mutagens (Oda et al., 1985). In the present study, we further examined the abilities of 151 chemicals to induce umu gene expression in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. Among the chemicals examined, 72 compounds induced umu gene expression, which could be defined on a basis of increased beta-galactosidase activity by 2-fold over the background level. The potent genotoxic compounds without metabolic activation were adriamycin, bleomycin, daunorubicin, 1,3-dinitropyrene, 1,6-dinitropyrene, 1,8-dinitropyrene, N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, furylfuramide, methyl methanesulfonate, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, mitomycin C, 1-nitropyrene and 4-nitroquino-line-1-oxide. In the presence of S9, aflatoxin B1, 2-aminoanthracene, Glu-P-1, IQ, MeIQ, MeIQx, Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 also induced umu gene expression markedly. Several chemicals such as 2-acetylaminofluorene, 9-aminoacridine, azobenzene, benzanthracene, benzidine, diethyl nitrosamine, 1-nitronaphthalene, paraquat, potassium dichromate and sodium nitrite were weakly genotoxic and the induction by these compounds could be detected only when the incubation time was prolonged from 2 h to 5 h. Data are also presented that some of the chemicals such as dimethyl sulfoxide, m-dioxan, 5-fluorouracil and paraquat, which have been reported to be non-mutagenic in Ames/Salmonella assay, were found to be active in inducing umu gene expression, while the known mutagenic compounds including acrylonitrile, 4,4'-dinitrobiphenyl, furfural, methylene chloride, 1-naphthylamine, sodium azide, o-tolidine and o-toluidine were non-genotoxic in the present assay system.",Is m-dioxan mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True

The pyrolyzates are potent mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines formed during cooking. Solution of these amines was mixed with aqueous suspension of bacterial cells or dietary fibers, and removal of these amines from the reaction mixture by centrifugation was defined as the binding. Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 were effectively bound to all gram-positive and some gram-negative bacterial cells, corn bran, apple pulp, and soy bean fiber. Binding of Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and cellulose was moderate, and to chitin and chitosan it was little. None but corn bran bound Glu-P-1 and Glu-P-2 effectively. Corn bran effectively bound all mutagens tested. The quantity of the binding of IQ, MeIQ, and MeIQx was dependent on the strain of bacteria and the kind of fiber. The mechanism of binding of Trp-P-2 to freeze-dried feces, Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC9018), and corn bran was investigated. The binding was pH dependent, occurred instantaneously, and was inhibited by the addition of metal salts. These results indicate that the binding was mostly due to a cation-exchange mechanism, but some irreversible binding of Trp-P-2 was observed, most notably to freeze-dried feces. The mutagenicity of Trp-P-2 for Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of S9 mix was inhibited by the addition of LC9018 or corn bran to the reaction mixture.

1078,"The standard Salmonella mutagenicity test uses two strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA1535 and TA100) containing the same base pair substitution mutation (hisG46). These strains differ only in that strain TA100 contains the plasmid pKM101, whose mucAB gene products enhance SOS mutagenesis. This makes strain TA100, in general, the more sensitive of the two for mutagen detection, raising the question as to whether or not to include strain TA1535 in the core battery of strains in routine testing. Out of 659 chemicals judged as mutagens in the S. typhimurium assay when subjected to the National Toxicology Program's screening protocol, 36 (5%) were evaluated as positive in strain TA1535 but not in strain TA100. Of these, 23 were judged as negative and 13 as equivocal in strain TA100, and 5 were positive or equivocal in at least one other strain (TA97 or TA98). In general, the data on these chemicals indicate that the absolute increases in revertants per plate induced in strain TA1535 were too small to have been judged as positive if similar increases occurred in strain TA100, which has a much higher spontaneous background. For three chemicals (acetaldehyde oxime, 6-mercaptopurine, and 1,3-butadiene) the absolute increases in revertants in strain TA1535 greatly exceeded those in strain TA100.

1079,"Cyclohexanone oxime is used primarily as a captive intermediate in the synthesis of caprolactam for the production of polycaprolactam (Nylon-6) fibers and plastics and also in a variety of industrial applications. Cyclohexanone oxime was selected for study because of the potential for human exposure and the interest in oximes as a chemical class. Toxicity studies of cyclohexanone oxime (approximately 99% pure) were carried out in male and female B6C3F1 mice; the compound was administered in drinking water for 2 weeks or 13 weeks. In addition, the genetic toxicity of cyclohexanone oxime was evaluated by determining mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium and induction of chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells in vitro, with and without S9 activation. The frequency of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of mice from the 13-week study was also determined. In the 2-week study, groups of five male and five female mice were given drinking water containing 0, 106, 312, 625, 1,250, or 2,500 ppm cyclohexanone oxime. No deaths occurred, and there was no decrease in weight gain in any group. No gross lesions were observed; there were significant increases in relative spleen weights of males and females in the 2,500 ppm group and increases in the relative liver weight of male mice exposed to 312 ppm or greater. In the 13-week studies, groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were given drinking water containing 625, 1,250, 2,500, 5,000 or 10,000 ppm cyclohexanone oxime. Deaths occurred in the 10,000 ppm groups and weight gain was depressed in males and females given 10,000 ppm and in females given 5,000 ppm. There were significant increases in relative spleen weight at exposure levels of 5,000 and 10,000 ppm and significant increases in the relative liver weights of males and females that received 10,000 ppm. Microscopically, hematopoietic cell proliferation was observed in the spleen of males and females in the 5,000 and 10,000 ppm groups. Centrilobular cell hypertrophy was observed in the liver of males in the 2,500, 5,000, and 10,000 ppm groups and in females in the 5,000 and 10,000 ppm groups. Olfactory epithelial degeneration was observed in all exposed groups. Cyclohexanone oxime was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535 with S9 activation only; results of mutagenicity testing of cyclohexanone oxime were negative in strains TA97, TA98, and TA100, with and without S9. Cyclohexanone oxime gave equivocal results in a test for induction of chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells without S9; with S9, results were negative. In vivo, no induction of micronuclei was noted in erythrocytes of mice treated with cyclohexanone oxime either for 13 weeks in drinking water or for 3 days by intraperitoneal injection. In summary, the major targets of cyclohexanone oxime toxicity are the erythrocyte, spleen, liver, and nasal epithelium. The no-effect level for erythrotoxicity is 2,500 ppm following 13 weeks of exposure. The no-effect level for hematopoietic cell proliferation in the spleen is 2,500 ppm. The no-effect level for hepatotoxicity is 1,250 ppm for males and 2,500 ppm for females following 13 weeks of exposure.

The mutagenic responses in TA98 were 2- to 6-fold lower compared to TA100. Furthermore, I and II were less active in TA100NR, while compound III was about four times more mutagenic in TA100NR compared to the parent strain TA100. Incubation of III with NADPH and bacterial lysates showed that the extent of reduction was greater in TA100 compared to TA100NR. High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis of the ethyl acetate extract obtained from incubation of III with lysates of TA100 revealed the formation of four metabolites with retention times of about 4.0, 5.7, 10.0, and 14.3 minutes. The spectroscopic and chromatographic properties of the components with retention times of 10.0 and 14.3 minutes were identical to two derivatives obtained by chemical reduction of III, and thus represent nitroreduction products. These derivatives have been identified as cis- and trans-oxime isomers of methyl 3,4-dichloro-2-furoate, based on spectroscopic analyses. These oximes were not mutagenic for TA100. Furthermore, III was more mutagenic under anaerobic conditions, suggesting that secondary superoxide or nitroanion free radicals generated from nitroreduction are not responsible for the mutagenicity of III. In addition, the higher mutagenic response in TA100NR, and the lack of mutagenic activities of the amino and the oxime analogs of III suggest that the mutagenic activation of III might be due to the nitroso intermediate or involve mechanisms other than nitroreduction.",Is oxime mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False

BQD did, however, induce a marked effect upon S-phase synthesis in the livers of female rats between 14 and 48 hr after a single oral dose of 250 mg/kg. A similar effect was also observed in the livers of male rats. There was no evidence of hepatotoxicity (in terms of elevated liver enzyme levels) after treatment of female rats with the compound indicating that the increase in cell proliferation was due to a direct mitogenic effect of BQD in this organ. Some liver mitogens have been found to be liver carcinogens; this does not appear to be the case for BQD.

In contrast to these results, a positive response was noted only for 2-(hydroxyimino)-N-phenyl-acetamide oxime in strain TA1535 in the absence of activation in the Salmonella/microsome test.",Is Acetaldehyde oxime mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
1084,"The urine of mice injected intraperitoneally with pyrene during exposure to NO2 was found to contain highly mutagenic compounds by means of the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98. The mice were exposed to 20 ppm NO2 for 3 days before intraperitoneal injection of pyrene (800 mg/kg of body weight). The pyrene-treated mice were further exposed to NO2 for an additional 24 hr, and the urine from the mice was collected in ice-cooled containers and stored frozen in the dark. The collected samples were treated with beta-glucuronidase and passed through activated Sep-Pack C18 cartridges. After elution with methanol, the effluent was concentrated and the residue was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The DMSO solution was fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography and the mutagenicity of each fraction was assayed with S. typhimurium strain TA98. The mutagenic compounds 3-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, 6-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, 8-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, and 1-hydroxypyrene were identified in the mutagenic fractions by mass spectrometry and UV-visible spectrophotometry with synthetic reference substances. These mutagenic compounds may have been formed by either nitration of hydroxylated pyrene, or hydroxylation of 1-nitropyrene, which is formed in vivo from pyrene and NO2, or the simultaneous occurrence of these two reactions in the mouse body.",Is 3-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1085,"Paper strips containing indicator dyes have been developed by defence scientists to change color upon exposure to certain agents but not to common solvents. As a preliminary step in studies on their possible genetic or carcinogenic hazard, 6 dyes used in these detection papers were tested with the Salmonella/mammalian-microsome assay. The 3 nitro arenes tested were found to be mutagenic. Two of them, Orasol Navy Blue 2RB (without metabolic activation) and Eastman Fast Blue B-GLF (with metabolic activation), induced higher yields of mutations in the frameshift revertible strains, but base substitution mutations also were found. The third nitro arene, ethyl-bis-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) acetate, induced only frameshift reversions, the greatest yields without metabolic activation. Because of weak but consistent mutagenic activation. Because of weak but consistent mutagenic effects with a fourth dye, thiodiphenyl-4,4'-diazo-bis-salicylic acid, fluctuation tests using Salmonella strain TA98 were performed, and dose-related, statistically-significant mutagenic responses were observed. Two remaining dyes, Fluorescent Brilliant Yellow R and 2,5,2',5'-tetramethyltriphenylmethane-4,4'-diazo-bis-beta-hydroxynaphthoic anilide, were not mutagenic in experiments using doses extending into the toxic range. Spot tests were performed on different paper strips containing the dyes. When the papers were eluted with dimethyl sulfoxide, responses were found to be qualitatively similar to those in the plate tests. Although microbial test results cannot be used to assess risk in man, these results indicate a potential mutagenic or carcinogenic hazard for individuals exposed to these dyes, especially the nitro aromatics.",Is Fast Blue B mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1086,"Air pollution is increasing, along with consumption of fossil fuels such as coal and diesel gas. Air pollutants are known to be a major cause of respiratory-related illness and death, however, there are few reports on the genotoxic characterization of diverse air pollutants in Korea. In this study, we investigated the mutagenic activity of various particles such as diesel exhaust particles (DEP), combustion of rice straw (RSC), pine stem (PSC), and coal (CC), tunnel dust (TD), and road side dust (RD). Ultra-fine particles (UFPs) were collected by the glass fiber filter pad. Then, we performed a chemical analysis to see each of the component features of each particulate matter. The mutagenicity of various UFPs was determined by the Ames test with four  Salmonella typhimurium  strains with or without metabolic activation. The optimal concentrations of UFPs were selected based on result of a concentration decision test. Moreover, in order to compare relative mutagenicity among UFPs, we selected and tested DEP as mutation reference. DEP, RSC, and PSC induced concentration-dependent increases in revertant colony numbers with TA98, TA100, and TA1537 strains in the absence and presence of metabolic activation. DEP showed the highest specific activity among the particulate matters. In this study, we conclude that DEP, RSC, PSC, and TD displayed varying degrees of mutagenicity, and these results suggest that the mutagenicity of these air pollutants is associated with the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in these particulate matters.",Is TD mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1537 strain?,True
1087,"Commercial anthraquinone (AQ) (9,10-anthracenedione) is produced by at least three different production methods worldwide: oxidation of anthracene (AQ-OX), Friedel-Crafts technology (AQ-FC) and by Diels-Alder chemistry (AQ-DA), with the final product varying in color and purity. AQ-OX begins with anthracene produced from coal tar and different lots can contain various contaminants, particularly the mutagenic isomers of nitroanthracene. AQ has been reported to be negative in a variety of genotoxicity tests including numerous Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assays. In addition, we report that AQ-DA is negative in the Salmonella-Escherichia coli reverse mutation assays, the L5178Y mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, for inducing chromosomal aberrations, polyploidy or endoreduplication in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Further, a previous 18 month bioassay conducted with AQ administered to male and female B6C3F(1) and (C57BL/6xAKR)F(1) mice reported no induction of cancer. Thus, it was somewhat unexpected that in a long-term study conducted by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) AQ-OX induced a weak to modest increase in tumors in the kidney and bladder of male and female F344/N rats and a strong increase in the livers of male and female B6C3F(1) mice. In the studies reported here, a sample of the AQ-OX used in the NTP bioassay was shown to be mutagenic in the Ames tester strains TA98, TA100 and TA1537. Addition of an S9 metabolic activation system decreased or eliminated the mutagenic activity. In contrast, the purified NTP AQ-OX as well as the technical grade samples AQ-FC and AQ-DA were not mutagenic in the Ames test. The chemical structure of AQ does not suggest that the parent compound would be DNA reactive. Therefore, a mutagenic contaminant was present in the NTP bioassay sample that is either directly mutagenic or can be activated by bacterial metabolism. Analytical studies showed that the primary contaminant 9-nitroanthracene (9-NA) was present in the NTP AQ-OX at a concentration of 1200 p.p.m., but not in the purified material. The 9-NA and any other contaminants that might have been present in the NTP AQ-OX induced measurable mutagenicity at 9-NA concentrations as low as 0.15 microg/plate in tester strain TA98, indicating potent mutagenic activity. On the basis of revertants per microgram, 9-NA was more potent than benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and was about equally as potent as the 2-nitrofluorene run concurrently as positive controls. TD(50) quantitative carcinogenicity potency estimates indicate that a carcinogen of a potency in the range between B[a]P and dimethylnitrosamine would be required to produce the observed carcinogenic response at the levels of the contaminants found in the test sample. While recognizing that there are limitations in extrapolating mutagenic potency to potential carcinogenic potency, these estimates do indicate that it is plausible that the 9-NA contaminant might have been responsible for all of the tumor induction observed in the NTP study. In fact, in the absence of reliable cancer data, the genetic toxicology profile indicates that AQ would not be a genotoxic carcinogen. Thus, no conclusion as to the carcinogenic activity of AQ can be made at this time.",Is 9-nitroanthracene mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1537 strain?,True
1088,"The standard Salmonella mutagenicity test uses two strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA1535 and TA100) containing the same base pair substitution mutation (hisG46). These strains differ only in that strain TA100 contains the plasmid pKM101, whose mucAB gene products enhance SOS mutagenesis. This makes strain TA100, in general, the more sensitive of the two for mutagen detection, raising the question as to whether or not to include strain TA1535 in the core battery of strains in routine testing. Out of 659 chemicals judged as mutagens in the S. typhimurium assay when subjected to the National Toxicology Program's screening protocol, 36 (5%) were evaluated as positive in strain TA1535 but not in strain TA100. Of these, 23 were judged as negative and 13 as equivocal in strain TA100, and 5 were positive or equivocal in at least one other strain (TA97 or TA98). In general, the data on these chemicals indicate that the absolute increases in revertants per plate induced in strain TA1535 were too small to have been judged as positive if similar increases occurred in strain TA100, which has a much higher spontaneous background. For three chemicals (acetaldehyde oxime, 6-mercaptopurine, and 1,3-butadiene) the absolute increases in revertants in strain TA1535 greatly exceeded those in strain TA100. Evaluation of the reproducibility of these findings and of the mechanisms and relevance of unique TA1535 positives should be useful when decisions are made as to whether this strain should be kept as a part of the core battery of strains in the S. typhimurium assay.",Is 6-mercaptopurine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or pKM101 strain?,True
1089,"Eight components of humic substances were ozonated. Mutagenic activity was found with TA100 with and without S9 mix for all ozonated components. Ozonated products of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde were separated into five fractions by silica gel chromatography and each fraction subjected to mutagenicity assay. Mutagenic activity was found in the chloroform and chloroform-acetone (1:1) fractions. The compounds in these fractions were identified, and aldehydes such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, glyoxal, glyoxylic acid and methyl glyoxal were found to be mutagenic. Mutagenic compounds are present in the polar fraction.",Is ozonated components mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1090,"We have previously described a very sensitive and efficient bacterial test designed to detect chemical carcinogens as mutagens. Chloroacetaldehyde is mutagenic in this system and is of interest because it is a possible metabolite in mammals of the large volume industrial chemicals 1,2-dichloroethane (ethylene dichloride) (3.5 billion kg/yr, U.S.) and vinyl chloride (2.5 billion kg/yr, U.S.), and of the antineoplastic agent cyclophosphamide. Chloroacetaldehyde reverts a new Salmonella bacterial tester strain (TA100). Chloroacetaldehyde is shown to be hundreds of times more effective in reversion of TA100 than is chloroethanol (ethylene chlorohydrin), a known metabolic precursor of chloroacetaldehyde and a possible metabolite of dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, or than vinyl chloride, which is itself mutagenic for TA100. Chloroethanol is shown to be activated by rat (or human) liver homogenates to a more highly mutagenic form with reversion properties similar to chloroacetaldehyde. Reversion properties of cyclophosphamide after in vitro metabolic activation suggest that chloroacetaldehyde is not the active mutagenic form of this antineoplastic drug.",Is Chloroacetaldehyde mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1091,"A precise understanding of differences in genomic mutations according to the mutagenic mechanisms detected in mutagenicity data is required to evaluate the carcinogenicity of environmental mutagens. Recently, we developed a highly accurate genome sequencing method, 'Hawk-Seq™', that enables the detection of mutagen-induced genome-wide mutations. However, its applicability to detect various mutagens and identify differences in mutational profiles is not well understood. Thus, we evaluated DNA samples from Salmonella typhimurium TA100 exposed to 11 mutagens, including alkylating agents, aldehydes, an aromatic nitro compound, epoxides, aromatic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We extensively analysed mutagen-induced mutational profiles and studied their association with the mechanisms of mutagens. Hawk-Seq™ sensitively detected mutations induced by all 11 mutagens, including one that increased the number of revertants by approximately 2-fold in the Ames test. Although the sensitivity for less water-soluble mutagens was relatively low, we increased the sensitivity to obtain high-resolution spectra by modifying the exposure protocol. Moreover, two epoxides indicated similar 6- or 96-dimensional mutational patterns; likewise, three SN1-type alkylating agents indicated similar mutational patterns, suggesting that the mutational patterns are compound category specific. Meanwhile, an SN2 type alkylating agent exhibited unique mutational patterns compared to those of the SN1 type alkylating agents. Although the mutational patterns induced by aldehydes, the aromatic nitro compound, aromatic amines and PAHs did not differ substantially from each other, the maximum total base substitution frequencies (MTSFs) were similar among mutagens in the same structural groups. Furthermore, the MTSF was found to be associated with the carcinogenic potency of some direct-acting mutagens. These results indicate that our method can generate high-resolution mutational profiles to identify characteristic features of each mutagen. The detailed mutational data obtained by Hawk-Seq™ can provide useful information regarding mutagenic mechanisms and help identify its association with the carcinogenicity of mutagens without requiring carcinogenicity data.",Is aldehydes mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1092,"Cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia) is an important spice which is widely consumed in the Indian subcontinent as well as in several other parts of the world. In the present study, NMR spectroscopy showed the presence of cinnamaldehyde to be the major component of the bark. The possible mutagenic effects of cinnamon bark ethanolic extract (CEE, 0.01-1 mg/plate) cinnamon oil (CNO, 0.125-1 mg/plate), and its active component cinnamadehyde (CLD, 0.125-1 mg/plate) were evaluated. Antimutagenic activity of CEE, CNO, and CLD was also tested against various food borne mutagens (heterocyclic amines and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)) and sodium azide (SA) using Ames assay. Similarly, the antimicrobial activity was studied using agar well diffusion assay against various pathogens. CEE was non-mutagenic in any of the five tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102, and TA104) in Ames test. CEE exhibited antimutagenic activity against all the mutagens tested in the higher doses. Additionally, CEE, CNO, and CLD were effective against various pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, S. typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli in the agar well diffusion assay. Promising antimutagenic and antimicrobial properties were shown by the cinnamon bark ethanolic extract and cinnamaldehyde, respectively. Therefore, their role in cancer chemoprevention, as well as a natural antimicrobial agent must be exploited and studied in depth in in vivo conditions.",Is CEE mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
1093,"Perillaldehyde, a natural monocyclic terpenoid found most abundantly in the herb perilla, has a long history of use as a flavouring ingredient to add spiciness and citrus taste to foods. Previously, it was judged to be safe by several international expert panels. To confirm the safety of flavourings placed on the European Union list of flavourings, perillaldehyde was selected by the European Food Safety Authority as a representative of a subgroup of alicyclic aldehyde flavouring substances to be evaluated for genotoxic potential. Perillaldehyde was tested in a bacterial reverse mutation assay, an in vitro micronucleus assay in human lymphocytes, an HPRT assay in mouse lymphoma cells, and a micronucleus/comet assay in Han Wistar rats. In contrast to previously published results, perillaldehyde induced mutation in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of metabolic activation. The comet assay was negative for duodenum and weakly positive for liver but only at a hepatotoxic dose of perillaldehyde. All other genotoxicity assays were negative. These data do not provide an indication of any genotoxic potential for perillaldehyde, and they provide the primary basis for recent scientific opinions regarding perillaldehyde genotoxicity announced by several international organizations responsible for safety assessment of food additives and flavourings.",Is perillaldehyde mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1094,"The antimutagenicity of α-hexylcinnamaldehyde (1), a semisynthetic and more stable derivative of cinnamaldehyde, was evaluated against common environmental pollutants in the bacterial reverse mutation assay. The pre-, co-, and post-treatment protocols were applied to assess the involvement of desmutagenic and/or bioantimutagenic mechanisms. Compound 1 (9-900 μM) produced a strong antimutagenicity (>40% inhibition) in the Salmonella typhimurium TA98 strain against the nitroarenes 2-nitrofluorene and 1-nitropyrene in almost all experimental conditions. A strong inhibition was also reached against the nitroarene 1,8-dinitropyrene and the arylamine 2-aminoanthracene in the cotreatment at the highest concentrations tested. In order to evaluate if an inhibition of bacterial nitroreductase (NR) and O-acetyltransferase (OAT) could be involved in the antimutagenicity of 1 against nitroarenes, the substance was further tested against 1-nitropyrene (activated by both NR and OAT) in TA98NR and TA98 1,8-DNP strains (lacking the NR and OAT enzymes, respectively). Although both desmutagenic and bioantimutagenic mechanisms appear mostly involved in the antimutagenicity of 1, based on data obtained in the TA98NR strain, applying the pretreatment protocol, compound 1 seems to act as an inhibitor of the OAT-mediated mutagen bioactivation. These results provide justification for further studies on 1 as a possible chemopreventive agent. ",Is α-hexylcinnamaldehyde mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1095,"For ages, lichens have long been investigated popularly for biological roles, mainly antitumor, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Many positive results were obtained in these previous research. Thus, in this study, we aimed to determine whether extracts of Usnea articulata (UAE) and Usnea filipendula (UFE) possessing a protection against aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-induced genotoxic and oxidative damage. The results of our studies showed that 5 μM concentrations of AFB1 increased the frequencies of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). However, when 5, 10 and 20 µg/mL concentrations of UAE and UFE was added to AFB1, the frequencies of SCE and MDA level were decreased and SOD, GSH and GPx level were increased. The Ames (Salmonella typhimurium TA1535, TA1537) and WP2 (Escherichia coli) test systems carried out evinced that UAE and UFE possess any mutagenicity, but have antimutagenic effects. Consequently, the results of this experiment have clearly shown that UAE and UFE have strong antioxidative and antigenotoxic effects that are associated with its antioxidant nature. A detailed study can be performed to determine the antioxidant properties of each compound that will extend the use of lichen extracts in food and pharmacy industries.",Is UAE mutagenic for TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
1096,"In this article, the genotoxic and antigenotoxic effects of methanol extract of Evernia prunastri (Huds.) Willd. (MEP) were studied using WP2, Ames (TA1535 and TA1537) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test systems. The results obtained from bacterial test systems demonstrated that MEP has strong antimutagenic potencies on TA1537 and WP2 strains. The highest inhibition rates for MEP on TA1537 and WP2 strains were 37.70% and 69.70%, respectively. According to the SCE test system, MEP reduced the genotoxic effects of aflatoxin. In order to clarify the mechanism underlying the antigenotoxic effects of MEP, the antioxidants were determined. Cotreatments of 5, 10 and 20 µg/mL concentrations of MEP with aflatoxin B1 decreased the frequencies of SCE and the malondialdehyde level and increased amount of superoxide dismutase, glutathione and glutathione peroxidase which were decreased by aflatoxin. The data obtained from this work have clearly shown that MEP has significant antigenotoxic effects which are thought to be partly due to the antioxidant activities and antioxidant inducing capability of MEP. This is the first report indicating the antigenotoxic activities of MEP against several mutagen agents such as N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, acridin and aflatoxin.

1097,"The algal extracellular products (ECPs) in three cultures of cyanobacteria species (Anabaena, Microcystis, and Oscillatoria) dominating the eutrophic reservoir populations and their toxins have been investigated in the present work. Using gas chromatography coupled with high-resolution electron-impact mass spectrometry (GC/EI-MS) and high performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) techniques, more than 20 compounds were found in the algal culture (including cells and filtrates) extracts. The main identified ECPs were classified to polysaccharides, hydrocarbons, and aldehydes. Odor causing substances such as trans-1,10-dimethyl-trans-9-decalol (geosmin) and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB)were also found in the algal cultures. The potential mutagenicity of the algal suspensions was also studied with the Ames test. The organic extracts of the algal suspension from the axenic cultures were mutagenicity in TA98 without S9 mix and in TA100 with and without S9 mix.

1098,"2-(3-Chlorobenzyloxy)-6-(piperazin-1-yl)pyrazine (3) is a potent and selective 5-HT(2C) agonist that exhibits dose-dependent inhibition of food intake and reduction in body weight in rats, making it an attractive candidate for treatment of obesity. However, examination of the genotoxicity potential of 3 in the Salmonella Ames assay using tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 revealed a metabolism (rat S9/NADPH)- and dose-dependent increase of reverse mutations in strains TA100 and TA1537. The increase in reverse mutations was attenuated upon coincubation with methoxylamine and glutathione. The irreversible and concentration-dependent incorporation of radioactivity in calf thymus DNA after incubations with [14C]3 in the presence of rat S9/NADPH suggested that 3 was bioactivated to a reactive intermediate that covalently bound DNA. In vitro metabolism studies on 3 with rat S9/NADPH in the presence of methoxylamine and cyanide led to the detection of amine and cyano conjugates of 3. The mass spectrum of the amine conjugate was consistent with condensation of amine with an aldehyde metabolite derived from hydroxylation of the secondary piperazine nitrogen-alpha-carbon bond. The mass spectrum of the cyano conjugate suggested a bioactivation pathway involving N-hydroxylation of the secondary piperazine nitrogen followed by two-electron oxidation to generate an electrophilic nitrone, which reacted with cyanide. The 3-chlorobenzyl motif in 3 was also bioactivated via initial aromatic ring hydroxylation followed by elimination to a quinone-methide species that reacted with glutathione or with the secondary piperazine ring nitrogen in 3 and its monohydroxylated metabolite(s). The metabolism studies described herein provide a mechanistic basis for the mutagenicity of 3.",Is 2-(3-Chlorobenzyloxy)-6-(piperazin-1-yl)pyrazine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
1099,"Phenylpropanoids that possess antimutagenic activity were isolated from the buds of clove (Syzygium aromaticum). The isolated compounds suppressed the expression of the umu gene following the induction of SOS response in the Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 that have been treated with various mutagens. The suppressive compounds were mainly localized in the ethyl acetate extract fraction of the processed clove. This ethyl acetate fraction was further fractionated by silica gel column chromatography, which resulted in the purification and subsequent identification of the suppressive compounds. Electron impact mass spectrometry, IR, and (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy were then used to delineate the structures of the compounds that confer the observed antimutagenic activity. The secondary suppressive compounds were identified as dehydrodieugenol (1) and trans-coniferyl aldehyde (2). When using 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (furylfuramide) as the mutagen, compound 1 suppressed 58% of the umu gene expression as compared to the controls at a concentration of 0.60 micromol/mL, with an ID(50) (50% inhibitory dose) value of 0.48 micromol/mL, and compound 2 suppressed 63% of the umu gene expression as compared to the controls at a concentration of 1.20 micromol/mL, with an ID(50) value of 0.76 micromol/mL. Additionally, compounds 1 and 2 were tested for their ability to suppress the mutagenic activity of other well-known mutagens such as 4-nitroquinolin 1-oxide (4NQO) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), which do not require liver metabolizing enzymes, and aflatoxin B(1) (AfB(1)) and 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), which require liver metabolizing enzymes and activated Trp-P-1 and UV irradiation. Compounds 1 and 2 showed dramatic reductions in their mutagenic potential of all of the aforementioned chemicals or treatment. For the search of the structure-activity relationship, the derivatives of 1 and 2 (1a and 2a-c) were also assayed with all mutagens. Finally, the antimutagenic activities of compounds 1, 1a, 2, and 2a-c against furylfuramide, Trp-P-1, and activated Trp-P-1 were assayed by the Ames test using the S. typhimurium TA100 strain.",Is Phenylpropanoids mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
1100,"5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a heme precursor that accumulates in some porphyric disorders and in lead poisoning which can undergo metal-catalyzed oxidation producing reactive oxygen species and the keto-aldehyde, 4,5-dioxovaleric acid (DOVA). Evidence in vitro of ALA-induced DNA lesions suggests that ALA and DOVA have mutagenic potential that could possibly contribute to an increased frequency of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). In this study, we evaluated the genotoxic potential of ALA and DOVA. In the absence of exogenous metabolic activation, ALA and DOVA were mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium tester strain TA104. ALA was also mutagenic in S. typhimurium TA102, but not in TA98, TA100, or TA1535, indicating an oxidative mechanism. Removal of H(2)O(2) with catalase gave only partial protection, suggesting generation of other mutagenic species. Both ALA and DOVA damaged the DNA of Escherichia coli PQ37, inducing the SOS response detected by an increase in beta-galactosidase activity. These results verified the potential mutagenic activity of ALA and DOVA and reinforce the hypothesis that DNA damage induced by ALA may be associated with the development of HCC in individuals suffering from AIP.",Is ALA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 strain?,True
1101,"The MeOH extract of Pueraria thunbergiana (Leguminosae) flowers and its fractions were subjected to Ames test to test the antimutagenicity. EtOAc fraction (1 mg/plate) decreased the number of revertants of Salmonella typhymurium TA100 by 95% against aflatoxin B, (AFB1). Phytochemical isolation of the EtOAc fraction afforded four isoflavonoids (tectorigenin, glycitein, tectoridin and glycitin) and one saponin (kaikasaponin III). Though the three isoflavonoids other than tectoridin showed significant antimutagenicity, the activity of kaikasaponin III was the most potent. Kaikasaponin III (1 mg/plate) decreased the number of revertants of S. typhymurium TA100 by 99% against AFB, but by 75% against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Tectorigenin (1 mg/plate) inhibited the AFB1-induced mutagenicity by 90% and MNNG-induced one by 76%. Glycitein and glycitin were less active than tectorigenin and kaikasaponin III. This result suggested that kaikasponin III prevents the metabolic activation of AFB1 and scavenge electrophilic intermediate capable of mutation. The two components with potent activities, tectorigenin and kaikasaonin III, significantly prevented the malondialdehyde formation caused by bromobenzene in the rat.",Is glycitein mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
1102,"The two formaldehyde (FA)-releasers dimethylol urea (DMU) and diazolidinyl urea (DZU) are widely used as preservatives or additives. They were tested for genotoxicity in three short-term test systems, i.e. in the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay, in the in vitro micronucleus test with V79 Chinese hamster cells and in the in vitro tubulin assembly assay using isolated tubulin from pig brains. The polymerization products obtained in the tubulin assembly assay were examined additionally by electron microscopy. In the S. typhimurium mutagenicity assay with the pre-incubation assay both FA-releasers tested show a clear and concentration-dependent increase in the number of revertants in strains TA98, TA100 and TA102 with and without metabolic activation (rat liver S9 mix). In all cases, a biologically relevant increase in the number of revertants was achieved within the concentration range tested (DZU: 0.04-1.8 micromol per plate, DMU: 0.21-8.33 micromol per plate). FA was tested at 0.06-2.5 micromol per plate and lead to similar effects.Both compounds induce the formation of micronuclei (concentration range tested: DZU: 2.5-50 micromol/l, DMU: 3.3-333 micromol/l). However, DMU shows a comparatively weaker effect exclusively in the absence of the metabolizing enzymes. By contrast, DZU yields a distinct increase of the micronucleus rate in the absence and in the presence of S9. In addition, DZU predominantly causes an increase of large micronuclei, which suggests that this compound has a marked aneugenic potential. Cytotoxic effects accompany the clastogenic effects of both DMU and DZU. The examination of DMU and DZU in view of a possible aneugenic potential in the tubulin assembly assay yielded the following results: DMU at concentrations up to 10 mmol/l did not influence the formation of microtubuli, whereas DZU inhibited this process completely at 3 mmol/l. FA at 6 mmol/l completely inhibited the tubulin assembly. These results could clearly be confirmed by electron microscopy examination. The different potential of the two compounds with respect to the inhibition of tubulin formation is apparently due to a significant difference in the degree of FA release. According to these results, both compounds have to be considered as genotoxic in vitro. On account of these data and because of the widespread use of these two compounds in various products used in daily life, a reevaluation of the risk associated with these compounds seems to be necessary.",Is DMU mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1103,"Glutaraldehyde (GA; CAS no. 111-30-8) has a wide spectrum of industrial, scientific and biomedical applications, with a potential for human exposure particularly in its biocidal applications. The likelihood for genotoxic effects was investigated in vitro and in vivo. A Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation assay showed no evidence for mutagenic activity with strains TA98, TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538, with or without metabolic activation. However, there was a weak mutagenic response (1.9-2.3-fold at the highest non-toxic concentration) with TA100 in the presence of metabolic activation. In a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) forward gene mutation assay (HGPRT locus) there were no consistent, statistically significant, reproducible or dosage-related increases in the frequency of 6-thioguanine resistant cells. There were no reproducible or dosage-related increases in sister chromatid exchanges in an in vitro test in CHO cells. An in vitro cytogenetics study in CHO cells showed no evidence for an increase in chromosomal aberrations on treatment with GA, either in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. In vivo, a mouse peripheral blood micronucleus test showed no increase in micronucleated polychromatophils at sampling times of 30, 48 and 72 h after acute gavage dosing with GA at 40, 80 and 125 mg kg(-1) (corresponding to 25, 50 and 85% of the LD(50)). The absence of an in vivo clastogenic potential was confirmed by no increase in chromosomal aberrations in a rat bone marrow cytogenetics study with sampling at 12, 24 and 48 h after acute gavage dosing with GA (12.5, 30 or 60 mg kg(-1) with males, and 7.5, 20 or 40 mg kg(-1) with females). Thus, in this series of tests, GA produced genotoxic effects in vitro only in a bacterial reverse mutation assay with no evidence for in vivo genotoxicity.",Is Glutaraldehyde mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
1104,"Furan is classified as a nongenotoxic hepatocarcinogen. It is thought to be activated to a toxic metabolite, cis-2-butene-1,4-dial, which is acutely toxic to liver cells. The resulting cytotoxicity is followed by compensatory cell proliferation, increasing the likelihood of tumor production. We examined the genotoxic activity of cis-2-butene-1,4-dial in several strains of Salmonella typhimurium commonly used in the Ames assay. This reactive compound tested positive in TA104, a strain that is sensitive to aldehydes. Mutagenic activity was concentration-dependent (1000 +/- 180 revertants/micromol). Incubation of cis-2-butene-1,4-dial with glutathione prior to addition of bacteria inhibited both the acute toxic and genotoxic activity of this compound. No evidence of mutagenic activity was seen at nontoxic concentrations in TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA102. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that cis-2-butene-1,4-dial reacts with DNA to form mutagenic adducts. Our data suggest that cis-2-butene-1,4-dial may be an important genotoxic as well as toxic intermediate in furan-induced tumorigenesis.","Is cis-2-butene-1,4-dial mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?",True
1105,"Methyl-tert-butylether (MTBE) is an oxygenate widely used in the United States as a motor vehicle fuel additive to reduce emissions and as an octane booster [National Research Council, Toxicological and Performance Aspects of Oxygenated Motor Vehicle Fules, National Academy Press, Washington, DC, 1996]. But it is the potential for MTBE to enter drinking water supplies that has become an area of public concern. MTBE has been shown to induce liver and kidney tumors in rodents but the biochemical process leading to carcinogenesis is unknown. MTBE was previously shown to be non-mutagenic in the standard Ames plate incorporation test with tester strains that detect frame shift (TA98) and point mutations (TA100) and in a suspension assay using TA104, a strain that detects oxidative damage, suggesting a non-genotoxic mechanism accounts for its carcinogenic potential. These strains are deficient in excision repair due to deletion of the uvrB gene. We hypothesized that the carcinogenic activity of MTBE may be dependent upon a functional excision repair system that attempts to remove alkyl adducts and/or oxidative base damage caused by direct interaction of MTBE with DNA or by its metabolites, formaldehyde and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), established carcinogens that are mutagenic in some Ames strains. To test our hypothesis, the genotoxicity of MTBE-induced DNA alterations was assayed using the standard Ames test with TA102, a strain similar to TA104 in the damage it detects but uvrB + and, therefore, excision repair proficient. The assay was performed (1) with and without Aroclor-induced rat S-9, (2) with and without the addition of formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH), and (3) with human S-9 homogenate. MTBE was weakly mutagenic when tested directly and moderately mutagenic with S-9 activation producing between 80 and 200 TA102 revertants/mg of compound. Mutagenicity was inhibited 25%-30% by FDH. TA102 revertants were also induced by TBA and by MTBE when human S-9 was substituted for rat S-9. We conclude that MTBE and its metabolites induce a mutagenic pathway involving oxidation of DNA bases and an intact repair system. These data are significant in view of the controversy surrounding public safety and the environmental release of MTBE and similar fuel additives.",Is MTBE mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1106,"Cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of root canal filling cements of various chemical composition were determined in vitro. Materials set for 24 h and 1 wk were eluted for 24 h in cell culture medium (cytotoxicity testing) and dimethyl sulfoxide or physiological saline (mutagenicity testing). The differences between cytotoxic potencies of eluates of the endodontic materials on L-929 cells were quantified colorimetrically (MTT test). Eluates of Traitement SPAD were about 5- to 30-fold more toxic than silver-free AH26, Tubli-Seal, CRCS, and Endomethsone N. The rank order of the toxic effects depended on the setting time of mixed materials. Dimethyl sulfoxide and saline eluates of Traitement SPAD, Tubli-Seal, Endomethasone N, CRCS, and Ketac-Endo were not mutagenic in the Ames test. Both eluates of silver-free AH26 set for 24 h were weakly mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA100. Weak mutagenicity of saline eluates of the material was also observed in TA97a and TA102. These results point to the possibility that mixed silver-free AH26 might contain small amounts of two mutagenic substances: bisphenol A diglycidyl ether and formaldehyde.","Is SPAD,Tubli-Seal,Endomethasone N,CRCS,Ketac-Endo mutagenic for TA100 or TA102 strain?",False
1107,"The mutagenic activities of several chlorinated butenoic acids, recently identified in chlorinated drinking waters, were determined by the Salmonella microsome assay. The Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, and TA104 were used without S9 mix. The results from the investigation showed that (Z)-2-chloro-3-(dichloromethyl)-4-oxobutenoic acid (MX, in the open form) was the most potent mutagen of the compounds tested. However, a significant number of mutations was also induced by compounds with structural similarities to MX. In general, all the compounds, except the butenedioic acids, were mutagenic in the assays for both base-pair substitution strains (TA100, TA104) and for the frameshift strain TA98, with the highest mutagenic response observed in strain TA100. When the aldehyde group of MX and of 2-chloro-3-(chloromethyl)-4-oxobutenoic acid (CMCF, in the open form) was replaced by a dichloromethyl group, the mutagenic response in strains TA98 and TA104 changed. We concluded that a frame-shift mutation occurred because of the replacement. The increase of the TA104 mutagenicity suggested that adenosine could be the target for these types of compounds. Further evidence for such possibility were the modified adenosine adducts we could identify for some chlorinated butenoic acids.",Is (Z)-2-chloro-3-(dichloromethyl)-4-oxobutenoic acid mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1108,"The essential oils and their monoterpenoid constituents have been widely used as fragrances in cosmetics, as flavouring food additives, as scenting agents in a variety of household products, as active ingredients in some old drugs, and as intermediates in the synthesis of perfume chemicals. The present study was undertaken to investigate the mutagenic potential of six monoterpenoid compounds: two aldehydes (citral and citronellal), a ketone ((+/-)-camphor), an oxide (1,8-cineole, also known as eucalyptol), and two alcohols (terpineol and (-)-menthol). It is part of a more comprehensive toxicological screening of monoterpenes under way at our laboratory. Mutagenicity was evaluated by the Salmonella/microsome assay (TA97a, TA98, TA100 and TA102 tester strains), without and with addition of an extrinsic metabolic activation system (lyophilized rat liver S9 fraction induced by Aroclor 1254). In all cases, the upper limit of the dose interval tested was either the highest non-toxic dose or the lowest dose of the monoterpene toxic to TA100 strain in the preliminary toxicity test. No mutagenic effect was found with (+/-) camphor, citral, citronellal, 1,8-cineole, and (-) menthol. Terpineol caused a slight but dose-related increase in the number of his+ revertants with TA102 tester strain both without and with addition of S9 mixture. The results from this study therefore suggest that, with the exception of terpineol, the monoterpenoid compounds tested are not mutagenic in the Ames test.",Is citronellal mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
1109,"The interaction of formaldehyde and glyoxal produced from linear dodecylbenzenesulfonate (DBS) in aqueous solution after simultaneous treatment with ozone and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and the effect of DBS on the mutagenic activity of formaldehyde and glyoxal were investigated. The decomposition of DBS in aqueous solution resulted in the formation of the mutagens formaldehyde and glyoxal as intermediate products after the simultaneous treatment for 4 hr. Therefore, the aqueous solution containing decomposed DBS after the treatment for 4 hr was mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA104 in the presence and absence of S9 mix. However, the mutagenic activity was greater than the sum of the mutagenic activity of formaldehyde and glyoxal formed from DBS. The aqueous solution mixed with formaldehyde and glyoxal did not increase the mutagenicity above the sum of the mutagenic activity in the presence or absence of DBS. Furthermore, DBS at concentrations of 2.0 micrograms/plate or less did not affect the mutagenicity of the mixtures containing formaldehyde and glyoxal. In addition, there was little bacteriocidal effect of the mixed solution on the mutagenicity test strains. These results suggest that unidentified mutagenic intermediate products were produced from DBS after simultaneous treatment with ozone and UV irradiation for 4 hr.",Is DBS mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1110,"Three compounds, capsaicin, thymol and borneol, were initially screened for mutagenic activity using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98 and TA100, with and without S9 metabolic activation, and 20 min standard preincubation time. Three other compounds, allyl isothiocyanate, eugenol and cinnamaldehyde, were screened for mutagenic activity as above, but with a prolonged, nonstandard preincubation time of up to 120 minutes. All six test compounds used in the assays are associated with the pungent properties of some specific spices in which the test compounds can be found to exist naturally. The first objective of this study was to observe if mutagenic activity can be correlated to the pungent properties of these six test compounds. However, due to toxicity and the observation that only capsaicin was mutagenic, using strain TA100 in the presence of S9 metabolic activation, it was not possible to deduce any relationship between mutagenicity and the test chemicals' pungent properties. Naturally occurring capsaicin, found in the spice Capsicum annum, was detected and quantified using thin layer and gas chromatographic techniques. The final objective was to detect the presence of antimutagenic factor(s) in C. annum that would suppress the mutagenicity of capsaicin. When the mutagenic capsaicin and 2-aminoanthracene were assayed in the presence of C. annum acetone extract, using strain TA100 with S9 metabolic activation, the mutagenic response of both the mutagens were reduced by approximately 50%. Assaying capsaicin and 2-aminoanthracene in the presence of chlorophyll, the mutagenic response of the two mutagens was reduced by less than 40%. From this observation it was inferred that chlorophyll can successfully suppress the mutagenicity activities of capsaicin and 2-aminoanthracene, together with other antimutagenic factors that were present in the acetone extract of C. annum.","Is borneol,thymol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?",False
1111,"2-Chlorocinnamaldehyde and 2-bromocinnamaldehyde, compounds of practical interest, for example, as bacteriocides and fungicides or for utilization in light sensitive layers, were tested in the Ames preincubation test with various Salmonella typhimurium strains, and in the SOS chromotest with Escherichia coli PQ 37.2-Chlorocinnamaldehyde was clearly mutagenic in strain TA 100 (6081 revertants/mumol) and in strain TA 98 (3050 revertants/mumol) without S9 mix, and was clearly positive in the SOS chromotest (SOSIP = 0.181). 2-Bromocinnamaldehyde was a strong mutagen in strain TA 100 (105, 500 revertants/mumol), in strain TA98 (41567 revertants/mumol) and in strain TA 1538 (15825 revertants/mumol), and also unambiguously mutagenic in strain TA 1535 (2110 revertants/mumol) without S9 mix. The SOSIP in the SOS chromotest was 1.5. Addition of S9 mix led to a marked decrease in the mutagenic activity of 2-bromocinnamaldehyde in all strains tested. In the case of strain TA 1535, mutagenic activity was abolished or not significant in the presence of S9 mix. The possible primary mechanisms underlying these mutagenic effects are discussed. Frame-shift activity of these halocinnamaldehydes can be explained by their planar structure.",Is 2-Chlorocinnamaldehyde mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1112,"Aside from the considerable number of reports on the physical and chemical properties of dental bonding agents, information concerning their biologic effects is sparse. Three dentin bonding agents (Prisma Universal Bond, Pertac Universal Bond, and Syntac) and the ingredients methylmethacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate, and glutaraldehyde were investigated in the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity test system using five different bacterial strains (TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102, and TA104). The materials as well as the ingredients were eluted in both dimethyl sulfoxide and physiologic saline, and serially diluted eluates were used in the plate incorporation test. Pertac Universal Bond and Prisma Universal Bond did not elicit any mutagenic effects in any of the bacterial strains. In contrast, Syntac adhesive showed clear mutagenicity in S. typhimurium strain TA102. Dimethyl sulfoxide eluates, as well as physiologic saline eluates of the Syntac bonding agent, caused numbers of revertants that were about 6 times higher than control values. Reversion rates with other strains were moderately enhanced. Glutaraldehyde, an ingredient of Syntac adhesives, caused mutagenicity in a manner similar to Syntac adhesive eluates. Neither 2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate nor methylmethacrylate monomer was found to be mutagenic over a broad concentration range.",Is Syntac adhesive mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1113,"Formaldehyde was examined for bacterial mutagenicity using Escherichia coli WP2(pKM101) and WP2uvrA(pKM101), and Salmonella typhimurium TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98, TA100 and TA102, in the absence of any exogenous source of metabolic activation. Using pre-incubation exposure, clear mutagenicity was seen for TA98, TA100 and TA102, and both E. coli strains. In standard plate-incorporation assays, consistent mutagenicity was seen only for TA100 and WP2uvrA(pKM101). No evidence of mutagenicity was seen for TA1535, TA1537 or TA1538 using either method of exposure. These data confirm the enhanced ability of the pre-incubation method to detect the mutagenicity of formaldehyde both quantitatively, as expressed by numbers of revertant colonies, and qualitatively, in terms of the range of indicator strains reverted. The relatively greater sensitivity of the pre-incubation assay is probably due to better containment of a volatile agent and/or lack of interaction with agar during the initial period of exposure. The findings are consistent with the suggestion that formaldehyde induces lesions in bacteria which are, at least to some extent, excision-repairable, and indicate that the presence of the R-factor plasmid may be required for the expression of its mutagenicity in excision repair-deficient Salmonella.",Is Formaldehyde mutagenic for pKM101 or TA100 or TA1535 or WP2uvrA or TA102 or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,True
1114,"Three short-term assays (the SOS chromotest, the Ames fluctuation test and the newt micronucleus test) were used to evaluate the genotoxicity of seven chemicals (4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, potassium dichromate, formaldehyde, sodium hypochlorite, benzo[a]pyrene, cyclophosphamide and 2-naphthylamine). In the SOS chromotest, all seven compounds except sodium hypochlorite and cyclophosphamide were found to induce primary DNA damage in E. coli. With the Ames fluctuation test, all seven chemicals except sodium hypochlorite showed mutagenic activity on Salmonella typhimurium TA100, TA102 or TA98. The newt micronucleus assay detected a clastogenic effect of all seven compounds except formaldehyde on the peripheral blood erythrocytes of Pleurodeles waltl larvae. For each compound, the sensitivity of the tests was compared; (1) the SOS chromotest is the least sensitive assay in every case, (2) the Ames fluctuation test is the most sensitive assay for studied chemicals with direct genotoxic effect and (3) the newt micronucleus assay is the most sensitive test for tested compounds with indirect genotoxic activity.

1115,"The mutagenicity of a series of nine alpha-dicarbonyl compounds against S. typhimurium strain TA100 was studied using the Ames test (standard plate incorporation assay) without preincubation. Acetylbenzoyl, sodium glyoxylate and camphorquinone were not mutagenic. The following sequence of activities (in revertants per mumol of free dicarbonyl added) was obtained: glyoxal greater than methylglyoxal greater than phenylglyoxal much greater than 1,2-cyclohexanedione much greater than diacetyl greater than 3,4-hexanedione. These compounds can be grouped in three series: aldehydes, ketones and enolizable ketones (1,2-cyclohexanedione). In each of the two first groups the mutagenic activity decreases when the size of the substituent increases. No relation was found between the mutagenicity and the molecular electronic and/or resonance parameters. The low or non-existent activity of some of the chemicals studied is discussed.

1116,"The beta-alkyl substituted acrolein congeners crotonaldehyde, trans-2-pentenal, trans-2-hexenal, 2,4-hexadienal, and trans-2-heptenal were clearly mutagenic in a slightly modified preincubation Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA100 with and without S9 mix using a threefold bacterial cell density and a 90-min preincubation time, whereas trans-cis-2,6-nonadienal did not show any mutagenic activity. The greatest impediment to adequate mutagenicity testing of these compounds is their toxicity toward bacteria. Within the congener family tested, toxicity increases as a function of both chain length and lipophilicity, and it becomes more and more difficult to demonstrate mutagenicity. Mutagenicity decreases with increasing chain length. This effect may be explained by increasing toxicity. The effect of S9 mix seems to be mostly nonenzymatic detoxication by nonspecific scavanger protection of bacterial cytotoxicity. No indication could be found that bioactivation plays a role in S9-mediated reduction of bacterial cytotoxicity. Although positive mutagenic outcomes could be obtained with the SOS chromotest for other alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, these acrolein congeners were not genotoxic in this test, most probably because they are toxic for the Escherichia coli bacteria PQ37 and PQ243.",Is trans-2-hexenal mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True

The mutagenic activities of 2,4-DNBAl in TA98NR and TA98/1,8-DNP6 were lower than in TA98, whereas the activity in TA100NR was higher than in TA100 and TA100/1,8-DNP6. The mutagenic activity of 2,6-DNBAl in TA100 and that in TA100 and TA100/1,8-DNP6 decreased. These results suggest that the mutagenicities of 2,4-DNBAl and 2,6-DNBAl are dependent either on the microbial nitroreduction and subsequent acetylation or the presence of an aldehyde group. Among the reactivity indices examined, the frontier electron density values were correlated to the mutagenicities of 2,4-DNBAl and 2,6-DNBAl in TA100, TA100NR and TA100/1,8-DNP6 and the values of energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit were correlated to the mutagenicities of several substituted dinitrobenzenes.","Is 2,4-DNBAl mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?",True

MNB produced 2-fold or greater increases in revertants in TA1538, both with and without S9, and in TA100 with S9 only. A 2-fold increase in revertants was seen in TA98, but only at the highest dose tested which did not produce inhibition of background growth.

1120,"Several polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) including nitrated and oxygenated derivatives of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were tested for mutagenic activity in the Salmonella/microsome assay. Among the compounds tested the isomer mix of nitro-1-hydroxypyrenes showed the highest direct mutagenic response in both the Salmonella strain TA98 and TA100 (1251 revertants/micrograms and 463 revertants/micrograms, respectively). The direct-acting mutagenicity of the nitro-1-hydroxypyrene isomer mix was dependent upon reduction of the nitro function as evidenced by the decrease in activity observed with the nitroreductase-deficient and arylhydroxylamine esterifying-deficient tester strains. The oxygenated derivatives of PAH containing aldehyde or keto groups showed weak or no mutagenic responses. In most cases addition of S9 was essential for any mutagenic activity and the strain TA100 was more sensitive than the strain TA98.

1121,"Allyl isothiocyanate, a naturally occurring compound, component of oil of mustard and human food plants such as cabbage, cauliflower and horseradish, has up to now been regarded as nonmutagenic in bacterial mutagenicity testing systems. Recently, however, it was found to cause transitional-cell papillomas in the urinary bladder of male F344 rats. Contrary to earlier reports, in this study allyl isothiocyanate showed clear mutagenicity for Salmonella typhimurium TA100 in the preincubation assay after longer, non-standard preincubation times (greater than 20 min). The mutagenicity is expressed only in the presence of a rat-liver homogenate metabolising system, i.e. it is indirect. However, high concentrations of rat-liver homogenate suppress the mutagenicity of allyl isothiocyanate. SKF525, inhibitor of microsomal oxygenase, reduces the mutagenic potential which on the other hand is increased in the presence of 1,1,1-trichloropropene-2-oxide, inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase. This indicates the occurrence of an epoxide intermediate in allyl isothiocyanate metabolism. Another metabolic pathway, namely hydrolysis to allyl alcohol and oxidation to acrolein, a known mutagen, also seems possible as cyanamide, inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase, can slightly increase the mutagenic potential. The reason(s) for allyl isothiocyanate's requirement for long preincubation times to express mutagenicity still requires elucidation, and the question arises: is allyl isothiocyanate a single, exceptional case or not?",Is acrolein mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True

This strain contains A X T base pairs at the site of the mutation (determined by DNA sequence analysis) in contrast to the other Salmonella tester strains that detect mutagens damaging G X C base pairs. This strain differs from previous tester strains in that the mutation has been introduced into a multicopy plasmid, so that approximately equal to 30 copies of the mutant gene are available for back mutation. The new strain detects a variety of oxidative mutagens, including x-rays, bleomycin, hydrogen peroxide and other hydroperoxides, streptonigrin and other quinones, and phenylhydrazine; a variety of aldehydes, including formaldehyde, glyoxal, kethoxal, glutaraldehyde, and malondialdehyde; a number of psoralens (in the presence of near-UV light), mitomycin C, neocarzinostatin, and UV light. Some of these mutagens have been previously shown to damage thymine in DNA. Several auxiliary tester strains also are described, including TA96, a frameshift tester strain with a hot spot for mutation at a run of five A X T base pairs with a specificity similar to that of TA102.

Except for malonaldehyde (MDA), which is not mutagenic in the concentrations produced radiolytically, the relative mutagenicities of the individual radiolytic products are unknown. With irradiated solutions of 2-deoxy-D-ribose, a relationship was found between the level of non-MDA aldehydes and the mutagenicity in TA100.

1124,"We have previously described a very sensitive and efficient bacterial test designed to detect chemical carcinogens as mutagens. Chloroacetaldehyde is mutagenic in this system and is of interest because it is a possible metabolite in mammals of the large volume industrial chemicals 1,2-dichloroethane (ethylene dichloride) (3.5 billion kg/yr, U.S.) and vinyl chloride (2.5 billion kg/yr, U.S.), and of the antineoplastic agent cyclophosphamide. Chloroacetaldehyde reverts a new Salmonella bacterial tester strain (TA100). Chloroacetaldehyde is shown to be hundreds of times more effective in reversion of TA100 than is chloroethanol (ethylene chlorohydrin), a known metabolic precursor of chloroacetaldehyde and a possible metabolite of dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, or than vinyl chloride, which is itself mutagenic for TA100. Chloroethanol is shown to be activated by rat (or human) liver homogenates to a more highly mutagenic form with reversion properties similar to chloroacetaldehyde. Reversion properties of cyclophosphamide after in vitro metabolic activation suggest that chloroacetaldehyde is not the active mutagenic form of this antineoplastic drug.",Is Chloroethanol mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1125,"Two pesticides, the fungicide Endodan (ethylene thiuram monosulphide) and the insecticide-acaricide Kilacar (bis(parachlorophenyl)cyclopropyl methanol), produced or used in the neighbouring countries of Bulgaria and Greece were investigated in a coordinated research programme for their genotoxic effects in a variety of test systems. This included the Ames test, Aspergillus nidulans for mitotic segregation, in vitro human lymphocyte cell cultures for SCE and chromosomal aberrations, in vivo bone marrow cells in hamsters and rats and the dominant lethal test in rats. The genotoxicity of Endodan was found to range from negative to slightly positive in different test systems. At concentrations of 7.5 and 12.0 micrograms/plate together with S9 mix it induced base-pair substitutions in the TA100 strain of Salmonella typhimurium at a rather low level. At a dose of 93 mg/kg b.w. it also caused chromosomal aberrations in acutely treated hamster bone marrow cells. A significant increase of SCE was also found in human lymphocyte cultures at a concentration of 20.0 micrograms/ml. Endodan was found to be negative in A. nidulans for somatic segregation, lymphocyte cultures for chromosomal aberrations and mitotic activity and in rats for dominant lethals and chromosomal aberrations. Kilacar was found to be a weak mutagen in the TA97 strain of S. typhimurium at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 micrograms/plate together with S9 mix. At concentrations of 1.0, 1.5 and 2 micrograms/ml Kilacar increased the number of mitotic segregants in A. nidulans by 160%, 220% and 156% respectively over the control. In Syrian hamster bone marrow cells after acute administration at concentrations of 0, 40, 80 and 160 mg/kg, the MI was 5.50, 4.30, 3.10 and 1.30 respectively, and an increase in chromosomal aberrations of about 300% over the control was observed with a concentration of 80 mg/kg. In human lymphocytes no significant changes were observed in either MI or SCE. In the dominant lethal test after chronic treatment of male rats at doses of 5.1, 10.2 and 102.0 mg/kg b.w. no significant mutagenic effect was found although a decrease was shown in the percentage of females with implants mated with treated males in the first week.",Is Kilacar mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1126,"The ability of 22 strains of intestinal bacteria to bind the mutagenic pyrolyzates--3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido-[4,3-b]indole [(Trp-P-1) CAS: 62450-06-0], 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido [4,3-b]indole [(Trp-P-2) CAS: 62450-07-1], 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole [(Glu-P-1) CAS: 67730-11-4], 2-aminodipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole [(Glu-P-2) CAS: 67730-10-3], 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline [(IQ) CAS: 76180-96-6], 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline [(MeIQ) CAS: 77094-11-2], and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline [(MeIQx) CAS: 77500-04-0]--was investigated and compared to their ability to bind to some dietary fibers (corn bran, apple pulp, soy bean fiber, cellulose, chitin, and chitosan). The pyrolyzates are potent mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines formed during cooking. Solution of these amines was mixed with aqueous suspension of bacterial cells or dietary fibers, and removal of these amines from the reaction mixture by centrifugation was defined as the binding. Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 were effectively bound to all gram-positive and some gram-negative bacterial cells, corn bran, apple pulp, and soy bean fiber. Binding of Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and cellulose was moderate, and to chitin and chitosan it was little. None but corn bran bound Glu-P-1 and Glu-P-2 effectively. Corn bran effectively bound all mutagens tested. The quantity of the binding of IQ, MeIQ, and MeIQx was dependent on the strain of bacteria and the kind of fiber. The mechanism of binding of Trp-P-2 to freeze-dried feces, Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC9018), and corn bran was investigated. The binding was pH dependent, occurred instantaneously, and was inhibited by the addition of metal salts. These results indicate that the binding was mostly due to a cation-exchange mechanism, but some irreversible binding of Trp-P-2 was observed, most notably to freeze-dried feces. The mutagenicity of Trp-P-2 for Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of S9 mix was inhibited by the addition of LC9018 or corn bran to the reaction mixture. The results indicate that bound Trp-P-2 did not cause mutation under the assay conditions.",Is pyrolyzates mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1127,"The genotoxic environmental contaminant 1-nitropyrene is metabolised in mammalian systems by pathways more complex than the straightforward nitroreduction which accounts for most of its biological activity in bacteria. In order to evaluate the role of O-acetyltransferase (OAT) activity in generation of genotoxic intermediates from 1-nitropyrene, the mutagenicity of the major primary oxidised metabolites of 1-nitropyrene was characterised in the Ames Salmonella typhimurium plate incorporation assay with strain TA98, and with variants of TA98 deficient (TA98/1,8-DNP6) or enhanced (YG1024) in O-acetyltransferase. 1-Nitropyren-3-ol was more mutagenic in the absence than in the presence of S9, while 1-nitropyren-4-ol, 1-nitropyren-6-ol and 1-nitropyren-8-ol required S9 for maximum expression of mutagenicity. 1-Nitropyren-4-ol (176 rev/nmol without S9, 467 rev/nmol with S9 in TA98) and 1-nitropyren-6-ol (13 rev/nmol without S9, 266 rev/nmol with S9 in TA98) were overall the most potent nitropyrenol isomers assayed. 1-Acetamidopyren-8-ol and 1-acetamidopyrene 4,5-quinone were only minimally active. 1-Acetamidopyren-3-ol exhibited direct-acting mutagenicity. 1-Acetamidopyren-6-ol, previously shown to be a major contributor to mutagenicity in the urines of rats dosed with 1-nitropyrene (Ball et al., 1984b), was confirmed as a potent (359 rev/nmol) S9-dependent mutagen. Both the direct-acting and the S9-dependent mutagenicity of all the compounds studied was enhanced in the OAT-overproducing strain and much diminished (though not always entirely lost) in the OAT-deficient strain, showing that OAT amplifies expression of the genotoxicity of these compounds. 1-Acetamidopyren-6-ol required both S9 and OAT activity in order to exhibit any mutagenicity; this finding strongly implicates N-hydroxylation followed by O-esterification, as opposed to further S9-catalyzed ring oxidation, as a major route of activation for urinary metabolites of 1-nitropyrene.",Is 1-Nitropyren-4-ol mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1128,"2-Methoxy-4-nitroaniline (MNA), an intermediate in the synthesis of azo dyes used in textiles and paints, is structurally similar to carcinogenic anilines. Human exposure occurs primarily in the occupational setting through handling of dye dust, and through use and disposal of MNA-containing products. MNA has been reported to induce contact hypersensitivity in a human, myocardial necrosis in rats, and bacterial mutagenicity. This study assessed the subacute toxicity, genotoxicity, contact hypersensitivity, and reproductive toxicity of MNA in rodents in an effort to more fully characterize its toxicological profile. B6C3F1/N mice were exposed to 0, 650, 1250, 2500, 5000, or 10,000 ppm MNA by dosed feed for 14-days to evaluate subacute toxicity and histopathological endpoints. In female mice, decreased body weight (13.5 %) and absolute kidney weight (14.8 %), compared to control, were observed at 10,000 ppm MNA; increased relative liver weight (10-12 %), compared to control, occurred at 5,000-10,000 ppm MNA. In male mice, absolute (15 %) and relative liver weights (9-13 %) were increased at 2,500-5,000 ppm and 1250-10,000 ppm MNA, compared to control, respectively. In both sexes of mice, minimal elevations of hemosiderin pigmentation (a breakdown product of erythrocytes), relative to control, were observed in the liver (10,000 ppm); minimal to moderate elevations of hemosiderin pigmentation (5,000-10,000 ppm) and minimal increases in hematopoietic cell proliferation occurred in the spleen (≥ 1250 ppm). In a reproductive toxicity study, timed-mated female Harlan Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to 0-10,000 ppm MNA by dosed feed from gestation day 6 through postnatal day (PND) 21. Decreases in mean litter weights were observed at 5000 ppm MNA, compared to control, beginning at PND1. To evaluate potential contact hypersensitivity, MNA (2.5-50 %, in dimethylformamide) was applied to the dorsa of both ears of female Balb/c mice once daily for three days. The increase observed in lymph node cell proliferation (10-50 % increase in thymidine uptake compared to control) did not reproducibly achieve the Sensitization Index (SI) 3 level, and there was no ear swelling evident following sensitization with 10-50 % MNA and challenge with 25 % MNA in the mouse ear swelling test. In bacterial mutagenicity assays, MNA (250-1000 μg/plate) induced significant increases, compared to control, in mutant colonies with and without metabolic activation enzymes in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA98. These data indicate that MNA is genotoxic, and may induce erythrocyte damage and reactive phagocytosis by macrophages in the liver and spleen.",Is MNA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1129,"3,5-Dichlorobenzidine and 3,5,3'-trichlorobenzidine were prepared by the reaction of 2,6-dichloronitrosobenzene with aniline and 2-chloroaniline, respectively, to give the appropriate substituted azobenzene; reduction and rearrangement gave the desired benzidine derivatives. The products were purified and characterized by mass spectrometry and [1H] nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The mutagenic activities of the chlorinated benzidines were determined, using the Ames tester strain TA98. 3,5,3'-Trichlorobenzidine is the most potent benzidine derivative yet reported. The activities of five chlorinated benzidines are compared, and rules for the effect of substitution on activity are discussed.","Is 3,5,3'-Trichlorobenzidine mutagenic for TA98 strain?",True
1130,"Mutagenicity induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (BHP) or cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) in Salmonella typhimurium TA102 was effectively reduced by flavonols with 3',4'-hydroxyl groups such as fisetin, quercetin, rutin, isoquercitrin, hyperoxide, myricetin, myricitrin, robinetin, and to a lesser extent also by morin and kaempferol (ID50=0.25-1.05 micromol per plate). With the exception of isorhamnetin, rhamnetin, morin, and kaempferol, closely similar results were obtained with both peroxides. Hydrogenation of the double bond between carbons 2 and 3 (dihydroquercetin, dihydrorobinetin) as well as the additional elimination of the carbonyl function at carbon 4 (catechins) resulted in a loss of antimutagenicity with the notable exception of catechin itself. Again, all flavones and flavanones tested were inactive except luteolin, luteolin-7-glucoside, diosmetin, and naringenin. The typical radical scavenger butylated hydroxytoluene also showed strong antimutagenicity against CHP (ID50=5.4 micromol per plate) and BHP (ID50=11.4 micromol per plate). Other lipophilic scavengers such as alpha-tocopherol and N,N'-diphenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine exerted only moderate effects, the hydrophilic scavenger trolox was inactive. The metal chelating agent 1,10-phenanthroline strongly reduced mutagenicities induced by CHP and BHP (ID50=2.75 and 2.5 micromol per plate) at low concentrations but induced mutagenic activities at higher concentrations. The iron chelator deferoxamine mesylate, however, was less effective in both respects. The copper chelator neocuproine effectively inhibited mutagenicity induced by BHP (ID50=39.7 micromol per plate) and CHP (ID50=25.9 micrommol per plate), the iron chelator 2,2'-dipyridyl was less potent (ID50=6.25 mmol per plate against BHP, 0.42 mmol per plate against CHP). In the absence of BHP and CHP, yet not in the presence of these hydroperoxides, quercetin, rutin, catechin, epicatechin, and naringenin induced strong mutagenic activities in S. typhimurium TA102. Radical scavenging activities of flavonoids against peroxyl radicals generated from 2,2'-azo-bis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH) as measured in the haemolysis test, confirmed that in general flavonoids with di- or trihydroxy hydroxyl functions especially in positions 3', 4', 5' are effective radical scavengers. In this test system, however, luteolin was the most potent compound, followed by epicatechin and eriodictyol. Again, isorhamnetin was a potent inhibitor of lysis of red blood cells despite the presence of a 3'-OCH3 function. Radical scavenging activities of flavonoids against the stable radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in principle obeyed the rules outlined above. Flavanones, tamarixetin, and rhamnetin, however, were only weakly active against DPPH, while isorhamnetin was again a potent compound. From these results we conclude that in the Salmonella/reversion assay with strain TA102 antimutagenic activities of flavonoids against the peroxide mutagens CHP and BHP are mainly caused by radical scavenging effects.",Is CHP mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True
1131,"The antimutagenic properties of South African herbal teas were investigated using the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay. Aqueous extracts of fermented and unfermented rooibos tea (Aspalathus linearis) and honeybush tea (Cyclopia intermedia) both possess antimutagenic activity against 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) and aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1))-induced mutagenesis using tester strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence of metabolic activation. A far less inhibitory effect was noticed against the direct acting mutagens, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), cumolhydroperoxide (CHP), and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) using TA102, a strain designed to detect oxidative mutagens and carcinogens. Depending on the mutagen used, the unfermented tea exhibited the highest protective effect. A similar response regarding the protection against mutagenesis was obtained when utilising different variations of the double layer Salmonella assay. The double layer technique proved to be more effective to detect the protective effect of the different tea preparations against the direct acting mutagens. With respect to indirect mutagens, the highest protection was noticed when the carcinogen was metabolically activated in the presence of the tea extract as compared with when the tea extract was incubated in a separate layer with the bacteria. The current data suggest that two mechanisms seem to be involved in the antimutagenicity of the tea extracts towards carcinogens that require metabolic activation: (i) the tea components may interfere with cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of these mutagens and (ii) the direct interaction between the tea constituents, presumably the polyphenolic compounds, with the promutagens and/or the active mutagenic metabolites. However, the mild and/or lack of protection and in some cases even enhancement of mutagenesis induced by direct acting or oxidative mutagens, provide new perspectives regarding the role of the polyphenolic compounds known to exhibit antioxidant properties, in the protection against mutagenesis in the Salmonella assay. The present study provides the first evidence on the antimutagenic activity of honeybush tea and further evidence on the antimutagenicity of rooibos tea.",Is honeybush tea mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
1132,"The influence of nitrilotriacetic acid trisodium salt (NTA) on the mutagenic and clastogenic activity of several water-insoluble or poorly soluble chromium compounds was determined by means of the Salmonella/microsome assay (plate test on TA100 strain) and the sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) test in mammalian cell cultures (CHO line). NTA in itself did not induce gene mutations nor did it increase the frequency of SCE. Cr(VI) compounds (Pb, Ba, Zn, Sr and Ca chromates) and an industrial Cr(VI) pigment, chromium orange (containing PbCrO4 PbO), were inactive or scarcely active mutagens in the Salmonella/microsome test when dissolved in water, but they were increasingly mutagenic when solubilized by 0.5 N NaOH or NTA (10 or 100 mg/ml). Also, the mutagenic activity of Cr(VI), contaminating an industrial Cr(III) pigment (chromite), was slightly enhanced by NTA. Mutagenicity of chromates was correlated with the amounts of Cr(VI) solubilized by NTA or alkali, as determined by the colorimetric reaction with diphenylcarbazide and atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and was decreased by incubation with microsomes, due to reduction of Cr(VI) to the genetically inactive Cr(III) form. In the SCE assay, the insoluble or poorly soluble Ba, Zn, Sr and Ca chromates and the insoluble Cr(VI) pigments zinc yellow (containing ZnCrO4 Zn(OH2], chromium yellow and molybdenum orange (both containing PbCrO4) were directly clastogenic due to cellular endocytosis taking place in prolonged treatments, and NTA significantly increased their chromosome-damaging activity.",Is NTA mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False

1138,"The reaction products of deoxyguanosine with 3,4-dimethyl-, p-methyl-, m-methyl-, m-methoxy-, p-bromo-, m-chloro- and unsubstituted styrene oxide were isolated and characterized. The reaction followed second-order kinetics. The reactive site was the N-7 site of guanine. The normal isomer (attack at CH2 of styrene oxides) and the abnormal isomer (attack at CH) were obtained. The Hammett reaction constant (rho) for the normal reaction was +0.42 and that for the abnormal reaction was -1.1. The difference of acid dissociation constant, rate of imidazole ring opening and rate of glycosidic bond cleavage was not found between the normal adduct and the abnormal adduct. Styrene oxides have been tested for toxicity and mutation in a liquid suspension assay using Escherichia coli WP2 and some of its repair deficient derivatives. Salmonella typhimurium TA100 was also employed. The mutation frequency of 3,4-dimethylstyrene oxide was higher in CM571 than in WP2. The greatest mutability was found with the WP2uvrA strain. 3,4-Dimethylstyrene oxide also acted as an inducer of E. coli K-12 (kappa). The mutagenicity of 3,4-dimethylstyrene oxide may depend on a combination of the recA-dependent and recA-independent action mechanisms. The mutagenicities of these compounds in WP2uvrA and TA100 increased in the order: m-chlorostyrene oxide = p-bromostyrene oxide less than m-methoxystyrene oxide less than styrene oxide less than m-methylstyrene oxide less than p-methylstyrene oxide less than 3,4-dimethylstyrene oxide. There was no correlation between the mutagenicities and the total reaction rates. On the other hand, the reaction rates of these compounds for the abnormal reaction correlated with their mutagenicities. The results indicate that the mutagenic effect of a chemical is not dependent simply on the quantity of the adducts, but may vary with structure of its adducts.",Is Styrene oxides mutagenic for TA100 or WP2uvrA strain?,True
1139,"Biochar production, from pyrolysis of lignocellulosic feedstocks, agricultural residues, and animal and poultry manures are emerging globally as novel industrial and commercial products. It is important to develop and to validate a series of suitable protocols for the ecological monitoring of the qualities and properties of biochars. The highly sensitive Salmonella mutagenicity assays (the Ames test) are used widely by the toxicology community and, via the rat liver extract (S9), can reflect the potential for mammalian metabolic activation. We examined the Ames test for analyses of the mutagenic activities of dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) extracts of biochars using two bacterial models (S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100) in the presence and in the absence of the metabolic activation with the S9-mix. Tester strain TA98 was most sensitive in detecting mutagenic biochar products, and the contribution of S9 was established. Temperature and times of pyrolysis are important. Biochar pyrolysed at 400°C for 10min, from a lignocellulose precursor was mutagenic, but not when formed at 800°C for 60min, or at 600°C for 30min. Biochars from poultry litter, and manures of calves fed on grass had low mutagenicities. Biochar from pig manure had high mutagenicity; biochars from manures of cows fed on a grass plus cereals, those of calves fed on mother's milk, and biochars from solid industrial waste had intermediate mutagenicities. The methods outlined can indicate the need for further studies for screening and detection of the mutagenic residuals in a variety of biochar products.",Is biochar mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1140,"River sediments may contain a huge variety of environmental contaminants and play a key role in the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems. Contaminants adsorbed to sediments and suspended solids may contribute directly or after remobilization to an adverse ecological and chemical status of surface water. In this subproject of the joint research project DanTox, acetonic Soxhlet extracts from three German river sediments from the River Rhine (Altrip and Ehrenbreitstein with moderate contamination) and River Elbe (Veringkanal Hamburg heavily contaminated) were prepared and redissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). These extracts were analyzed with a standard bioassay battery with organisms from different trophic levels (bacteria, algae, Daphnia, fish) as well as in the Ames test and the umuC test for bacterial mutagenicity and genotoxicity according to the respective OECD and ISO guidelines. In total, 0.01% (standard) up to 0.25% (only fish embryo test) of the DMSO sediment extract was dosed to the test systems resulting in maximum sediment equivalent concentrations (SEQ) of 2 up to 50 g l(-1). The sediment of Veringkanal near Hamburg harbor was significantly more toxic in most tests compared to the sediment extracts from Altrip and Ehrenbreitstein from the River Rhine. The most toxic effect found for Veringkanal was in the algae test with an ErC50 (72 h) of 0.00226 g l(-1) SEQ. Ehrenbreitstein and Altrip samples were about factor 1,000 less toxic. In the Daphnia, Lemna, and acute fish toxicity tests, no toxicity at all was found at 2 g l(-1) SEQ. corresponding to 0.01% DMSO. Only when increasing the DMSO concentration the fish embryo test showed a 22-fold higher toxicity for Veringkanal than for Ehrenbreitstein and Altrip samples, while the toxicity difference was less evident for the Daphnia test due to the overlaying solvent toxicity above 0.05% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The higher toxicities observed with the Veringkanal sample are supported by the PAH and PCB concentrations analyzed in the sediments. The sediment extracts of Altrip and Veringkanal were mutagenic in the Ames tester strain TA98 with metabolic activation (S9-mix).

1142,"2-Hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (HNQ; Lawsone; CAS 83-72-7) is the principal natural dye ingredient contained in the leaves of Henna (Lawsonia inermis). Published genotoxicity studies on HNQ suggested it was a weak bacterial mutagen for Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 or was more clearly mutagenic for strain TA 2637, both in the presence of metabolic activation. HNQ was unable to induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster. However, a small increase in micronucleus frequency was reported in the bone marrow of mice at a single mid-range dose level, 24h after intraperitoneal injection. In view of the wide use of Henna hair dyes it was deemed necessary to conduct a thorough investigation, under Good Laboratory Practice conditions, of the genotoxicity of HNQ. HNQ was non-mutagenic in bacterial (Ames test) or mammalian (V79 hprt) assays. It was borderline positive in a mouse lymphoma tk mutation assay and a chromosome aberration test (CHO cells), results that may reflect a similar clastogenic mechanism. Negative in vivo genotoxicity results were noted in the rat hepatocyte in vivo/in vitro UDS test, in peripheral lymphocytes (chromosome aberrations) of rats receiving repeated oral doses of HNQ at the MTD for 28 days, and in mouse and hamster bone marrow chromosome aberration tests. However small, but statistically significant increases in the incidence of bone marrow micronuclei were observed in two out of five tests at 72 h after dosing, but not at 24 or 48 h. There was evidence of haematotoxicity at 72 h, which may have been enhanced by the vehicle (DMSO) used in the positive tests. As erythropoiesis and administration of haematotoxic agents are known to induce small increases in the frequency of bone marrow micronuclei, typically at delayed sampling times, the data suggest that the positive 72 h response produced by HNQ is consistent with stimulation of haematopoiesis subsequent to haematological toxicity of HNQ, and not due to a DNA-reactive mechanism. Overall, the weight of evidence suggests that Henna and HNQ pose no genotoxic risk to the consumer.",Is HNQ mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1143,"Extracts, isolated through sequential fractionation and partition procedures described previously (Martinez et al. 1994) from aflatoxin-free corn and aflatoxin-contaminated corn with and without ammonia treatment, were investigated for mutagenic potential using the Ames test (TA 100 tester strain). 2-Aminofluorene (2-AF) and pure aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) were used as positive controls. Although TA100 showed mutagenic response to pure AFB1 at a dose of ca 10 ng/plate, all isolates tested from ammonia-treated aflatoxin-contaminated corn containing 7500 ng AFB1/g did not exhibit positive results in the Ames test. Additionally, isolates from non-ammonia-treated aflatoxin-contaminated corn failed to give positive mutagenic potentials. These results indicate that differences between the mutagenic potentials of pure aflatoxins and of aflatoxins in naturally-contaminated corn exist. CH2Cl2 extracts (the fractions containing aflatoxins) obtained from aflatoxin-contaminated corn with and without ammonia treatment were applied to preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) in an effort to separate aflatoxins and/or ammonia/aflatoxin reaction products from the ""unknown interfering materials' existing in the corn matrix. Each of the fractions separated by TLC was tested by the Ames test with S9 activation and none of them gave a mutagenic response to TA100. CH2Cl2 extracts in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) obtained from non-ammonia-treated aflatoxin-free corn were spiked with pure AFB1 and tested by TA100 with S9 activation. Again, no positive responses were observed. These findings provide further evidence of ""unknown interfering materials' in corn which may bind with aflatoxin and/or can be extracted by CH2Cl2 together with aflatoxin, and, therefore, block the mutagenic activity of aflatoxin in the Ames test. Those materials were not separated from the aflatoxins by the TLC technique used in the present study. Possible reasons and further studies required to evaluate this phenomenon are discussed.",Is aflatoxin-free corn mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
1144,"Dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) is activated to mutagenic species in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100) by hamster hepatic S9 preparation. This S9 activity is induced by administration of ethanol to the animals. The organic solvents dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (MP) inhibit this mutagenicity, apparently because they inhibit DMN demethylase activity (assayed as formaldehyde production). Ellagic acid, dissolved in DMSO or MP, had no inhibitory effect on DMN mutagenicity, beyond the effect of the solvent vehicle.",Is dimethylsulphoxide mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
1145,"Mutagenicity of a commercially available N-nitrosodiethanolamine (NDELA) and purified NDELA was examined, using Salmonella typhimurium TA100 as a tester strain. Purified NDELA was positive in the presence of liver activation system from either rats or hamsters, but the mutagenicity was completely lost when dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as a solvent. In contrast, the commercial NDELA which was chemically of 93.8% purity showed positive mutagenicity without metabolic activation, and the liver activation system and DMSO had no effect on the direct mutagenic activity. These results indicate that an apparent discrepancy among previous findings of several investigators with the mutagenic response of NDELA might be due to an impurity in NDELA samples and the solvent, DMSO.",Is NDELA mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1146,"The urine of mice injected intraperitoneally with pyrene during exposure to NO2 was found to contain highly mutagenic compounds by means of the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98. The mice were exposed to 20 ppm NO2 for 3 days before intraperitoneal injection of pyrene (800 mg/kg of body weight). The pyrene-treated mice were further exposed to NO2 for an additional 24 hr, and the urine from the mice was collected in ice-cooled containers and stored frozen in the dark. The collected samples were treated with beta-glucuronidase and passed through activated Sep-Pack C18 cartridges. After elution with methanol, the effluent was concentrated and the residue was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The DMSO solution was fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography and the mutagenicity of each fraction was assayed with S. typhimurium strain TA98. The mutagenic compounds 3-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, 6-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, 8-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, and 1-hydroxypyrene were identified in the mutagenic fractions by mass spectrometry and UV-visible spectrophotometry with synthetic reference substances. These mutagenic compounds may have been formed by either nitration of hydroxylated pyrene, or hydroxylation of 1-nitropyrene, which is formed in vivo from pyrene and NO2, or the simultaneous occurrence of these two reactions in the mouse body.",Is 1-hydroxypyrene mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1147,"Hexachloroacetone, CCl3--CO--CCl3, reverts the Ames strains TA98 and TA100 but not the non-plasmid strains TA1537, TA1535 and TA1538. In the absence of solvent, the number of revertant colonies is 5 times the spontaneous reversion rate for TA100 and 10 times the spontaneous reversion rate for TA98 with 26 mg hexachloroacetone per plate. This effect is seen in the absence of rat liver microsomes. In dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solution a more complicated pattern is seen. In DMSO solution cooled between 18 and 20 degrees C, The maximum nuber of revertants is similar to that found in the absence of DMSO, but only 1.75 mg hexachloroacetone per plate is needed. When DMSO solution of hexachloroacetone is warmed above 20 degrees C, a yellow color develops and the solution becomes more toxic to the test bacteria. The maximum number of revertants is then produced at about 0.5 mg hexachloroacetone per plate. Hexachloroacetone is found to be active, without microsomal activation, in the E. coli WP-2 and E. coli rec-BC test systems. Hexachloroacetone readily reacts with water in DMSO solutions to form the non-mutagenic hexachloroacetone hydrate.",Is Hexachloroacetone mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True

The new Pt(II) complexes exhibited high in vitro cytotoxicity on cisplatin sensitive and resistant cell lines and showed negligible reactivity with nucleobases (Guo and 5'-GMP) but selective substitution of DMSO/DMS with soft biological nucleophiles, such as L-methionine. In order to assess the ability of the new complexes with respect to cisplatin to induce apoptosis by interaction with nongenomic targets, the Ames' test, a standard reverse mutation assay, was carried out on two Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA98 and TA100). Interestingly, the new complexes did not show the well-known mutagenic activity exhibited by cisplatin and are, therefore, able to activate apoptotic pathways without interacting with DNA.","Is Pt(O,O'-acac)(γ-acac)(L) mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?",False
1149,"Destruction procedures for dimethylsulfate (DMS), diethylsulfate (DES), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) have been investigated using treatment by 1 N NaOH, 1 N NH4OH, 1 M Na2CO3, and 1 M Na2S2O3. During the kinetic study of the destruction process, the determination of remaining concentrations of the alkylating agents was performed by the derivatization of p-nitrophenoxide to p-nitroanisole and p-nitrophenetole, which were separated by high performance liquid chromatography. The mutagenic activity of the destruction products was evaluated by the Ames test using Salmonella tester strains TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA102. The kinetics of destruction in every case followed a time-dependent exponential relationship. Solutions of 1 M Na2S2O3 showed the highest capacity for destruction of the four alkylating agents, half-lives of DMS, DES, MMS, and EMS being 0.14 min, 1.26 min, 0.60 min, and 5.26 min, respectively. No mutagenic activity was detected following complete destruction in 1 M Na2S2O3.",Is destruction products mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
1150,"The genotoxicity and mutagenicity of Halfenprox, a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide and acaricide, was assessed using two standard genotoxicity assays of the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay (Ames test) and in vitro micronucleus (MN) assay in human peripheral lymphocytes. In the Ames test, Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100 were treated with or without S9 fraction. The doses of Halfenprox were 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 μg/plate and test materials were dissolved in DMSO. The concentrations of Halfenprox did not show mutagenic activity on both strains with and without S9 fraction. The MN assay was used to investigate the genotoxic effects of Halfenprox in human peripheral lymphocytes treated with 250, 500, 750, and 1000 μg/ml concentrations of Halfenprox for 24 and 48 h, and at 1000 μg/ml the concentration was significantly increased and the MN formation was compared with the negative control for both treatment periods. In addition, a significant decrease of the nuclear devision index (NDI) values at the higher concentrations of Halfenprox and at both treatment periods was observed.",Is Halfenprox mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1151,"River sediments may contain a huge variety of environmental contaminants and play a key role in the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems. Contaminants adsorbed to sediments and suspended solids may contribute directly or after remobilization to an adverse ecological and chemical status of surface water. In this subproject of the joint research project DanTox, acetonic Soxhlet extracts from three German river sediments from the River Rhine (Altrip and Ehrenbreitstein with moderate contamination) and River Elbe (Veringkanal Hamburg heavily contaminated) were prepared and redissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). These extracts were analyzed with a standard bioassay battery with organisms from different trophic levels (bacteria, algae, Daphnia, fish) as well as in the Ames test and the umuC test for bacterial mutagenicity and genotoxicity according to the respective OECD and ISO guidelines. In total, 0.01% (standard) up to 0.25% (only fish embryo test) of the DMSO sediment extract was dosed to the test systems resulting in maximum sediment equivalent concentrations (SEQ) of 2 up to 50 g l(-1). The sediment of Veringkanal near Hamburg harbor was significantly more toxic in most tests compared to the sediment extracts from Altrip and Ehrenbreitstein from the River Rhine. The most toxic effect found for Veringkanal was in the algae test with an ErC50 (72 h) of 0.00226 g l(-1) SEQ. Ehrenbreitstein and Altrip samples were about factor 1,000 less toxic. In the Daphnia, Lemna, and acute fish toxicity tests, no toxicity at all was found at 2 g l(-1) SEQ. corresponding to 0.01% DMSO. Only when increasing the DMSO concentration the fish embryo test showed a 22-fold higher toxicity for Veringkanal than for Ehrenbreitstein and Altrip samples, while the toxicity difference was less evident for the Daphnia test due to the overlaying solvent toxicity above 0.05% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The higher toxicities observed with the Veringkanal sample are supported by the PAH and PCB concentrations analyzed in the sediments. The sediment extracts of Altrip and Veringkanal were mutagenic in the Ames tester strain TA98 with metabolic activation (S9-mix). The findings allow a better ecotoxicological characterization of the sediments extensively analyzed in all subprojects of the DanTox project (e.g., Garcia-Kaeufer et al.

In the absence of agreed limit values for sediment extracts in standard tests, further data with unpolluted reference sediments are required for a quantitative risk assessment of the investigated polluted sediments.",Is Altrip mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1152,"A paving asphalt and a vacuum residuum (derived from crude oil by atmospheric and subsequent vacuum distillation and used as a blend stock for asphalt) were tested in skin carcinogenesis assays in mice and in optimized Ames assays for mutagenic activity. In the skin cancer tests, each substance was applied twice weekly for 104 weeks to the clipped backs of groups of 50 male C3H mice. Neither the paving asphalt nor the vacuum residuum (30% weight/volume and 75% weight/weight in US Pharmacopeia mineral oil, respectively) produced any tumors. The positive control benzo[a]pyrene (0.05% w/v in toluene) induced tumors in 46 of 50 mice, demonstrating the effectiveness of the test method. Salmonella typhimurium tester strain TA98 was used in the optimized Ames assay to evaluate mutagenic potential. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) extractions of the substances were not mutagenic when tested up to toxic limits. Thus, under the conditions of these studies, neither the paving asphalt nor the vacuum residuum was carcinogenic or mutagenic.",Is vacuum residuum mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1153,"Mutagenic and genotoxic effects of metolcarb were investigated by both bacterial reverse mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102 strains with or without metabolic activation system (S9) and Allium cepa root meristematic cells, respectively. Metolcarb was dissolved in DMSO in Ames/Salmonella test system. 0.1, 1 and 10 microg/plate doses of metolcarb were found to be mutagenic S. typhimurium TA98 without S9. In Allium root growth inhibition test, EC50 value was determined 200 ppm and 0.5xEC50, EC50 and 2xEC50 concentrations of metolcarb were introduced to onion tuber roots and distilled water used as a negative control. Mitotic index (MI), increased in all concentrations compared to control at each exposure time. While disturbed anaphase-telophase, chromosome laggards, stickiness and bridges were observed in anaphase-telophase cells, pro-metaphase, C-mitosis, polyploidy, binuclear cells and disturbed nucleus were observed in other cells. The results were also analyzed statistically by using SPSS for Windows, Mann-Whitney test and Duncan's multiple range tests were performed respectively.",Is Metolcarb mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1154,"Andrographis paniculata is used in the traditional medicine for cold and influenza remedy. The main endeavor in this study was to assess the genotoxicity of the standardized extract of A. paniculata (KalmCold) through three different in vitro tests: Ames, chromosome aberration (CA), and micronucleus (MN). Ames test was performed at 5000 microg/ml, 1581 microg/ml, 500 microg/ml, 158 microg/ml, 50 microg/ml, 16 microg/ml, while the clastogenicity tests were performed at 80 microg/ml, 26.6 microg/ml, 8.8 microg/ml for short-term treatment without S9; 345 microg/ml, 115 microg/ml, 38.3 microg/ml for short-term treatment with S9; and 46 microg/ml, 15.3 microg/ml, 5.1 microg/ml for long-term without S9 using DMSO as a vehicle control. Results of Ames test confirmed that KalmCold did not induce mutations both in the presence and absence of S9 in Salmonella typhimurium mutant strains TA98 and TAMix. In CA and MN, KalmCold did not induce clastogenicity in CHO-K1 cells in vitro. Based on our results, it is evident that KalmCold is genotoxically safe. Additionally in acute oral toxicity study, female rats were treated at 5000 mg/kg of KalmCold and observed for signs of toxicity for 14 days. KalmCold did not produce any treatment-related toxic effects in rats.",Is KalmCold mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1155,"The objective of this study was to assess the mutagenic potential of a synthesized tripeptide, L-valyl-L-prolyl-L-proline (VPP), to induce mutational changes in Salmonella typhimurium LT2 strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98, and TA100, and Escherichia coli strain WP2uvrA in the classical Ames test protocol. Bacteria were exposed to plate concentrations of VPP of 0, 156.2, 312.5, 625, 1250, 2500, and 5,000 microg/plate in distilled water, in the presence and absence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver homogenate preparation (S9). Positive-control agents included sodium azide (TA100 and TA1535); 2-aminoanthracene (TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and WP2uvrA); 9-aminoacridine (TA1537); 2-nitrofluorene (TA98); and N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (WP2uvrA) in DMSO. Incubations were conducted at 37 degrees C for about 48 h then revertant colonies were counted. All positive-control agents were consistently and unequivocally positive, but there was no evidence that VPP induced increases in the incidences of revertant colonies in any bacterial strain with and without metabolic activation. These findings were replicated in a second, confirmatory test performed with and without S9. The results of the experiments revealed no treatment-associated changes in the incidence of revertant colonies in any bacterial strain tested. These results support a conclusion that, under the experimental conditions described, there is no evidence that VPP possesses mutagenic potential.",Is VPP mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or WP2uvrA or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
1156,"A battery of in vitro short-term tests revealing different genetic end-points was set up in order to study surface-water genotoxicity after disinfection with different biocides: sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)) and peracetic acid (PAA). The surface water both before and after disinfection was concentrated by adsorption on C(18) silica cartridges and the concentrates containing non-volatile organics were divided into different portions for chemical analyses and biological assays. The following in vitro tests were conducted on the water concentrates dissolved in DMSO: the Salmonella mutagenicity assay with S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100; the SOS Chromotest with Escherichia coli, the Microtox and Mutatox assays with Vibrio fischeri; and gene conversion, point mutation and mitochondrial DNA mutability assays with D7 diploid Saccharomices cerevisiae strain. The results show that the SOS Chromotest and the yeast assays are highly sensitive in detecting genotoxicity. The surface-water extracts were very often toxic to most of the test organisms considered, partially masking their potential mutagenic activity. Therefore, the assays with E. coli and with S. cerevisiae are more likely to show a mutagenic effect because these organisms are generally less sensitive to most toxic compounds. Among the tested disinfectants, NaClO and ClO(2) increased water genotoxicity, whereas PAA was able to slightly reduce raw water activity. However, because the organic compounds in the lake water varied with the season of the year, the disinfection processes, at times, both increased and decreased the raw water activity.",Is PAA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1157,"Cyracure UVR 6105 is a cycloaliphatic epoxy monomer and has both carboxylate and epoxy groups, with the potential for rapid polymerization. It is widely used in industry for the preparation of inks, resins, coatings, and was proposed for incorporation into dental composites. The objective of this study was to determine the mutagenic potential of this chemical related to its metabolite products. Several doses of Cyracure UVR 6105 were dissolved in DMSO and subjected to the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. A metabolic activation system (S9-mix) was used consisting of Arochlor-induced liver S9 homogenate enriched with NADP and glucose-6-phosphate cofactors. In contrast to studies without S9-mix, Cyracure UVR 6105 exhibited enhanced genotoxic activities with strains TA100 and TA1535 in the presence of liver S9-mix. From in vitro metabolism of Cyracure UVR 6105 with S9-mix, as used in the Ames assay, several metabolites were identified. The alcohol metabolite, 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethanol, containing intact epoxy group was identified in the organic solvent extract. This metabolite was synthesized and proved to be mutagenic against TA100 when assayed in the presence and absence of S9-mix. Results showed that the increased mutagenicity of Cyracure UVR-6105 in the presence of liver enzymes is due to the formation of the mutagenic metabolite 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethanol.",Is Cyracure UVR-6105 mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
1158,"2-Hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (HNQ; Lawsone; CAS 83-72-7) is the principal natural dye ingredient contained in the leaves of Henna (Lawsonia inermis). Published genotoxicity studies on HNQ suggested it was a weak bacterial mutagen for Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 or was more clearly mutagenic for strain TA 2637, both in the presence of metabolic activation. HNQ was unable to induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster. However, a small increase in micronucleus frequency was reported in the bone marrow of mice at a single mid-range dose level, 24h after intraperitoneal injection. In view of the wide use of Henna hair dyes it was deemed necessary to conduct a thorough investigation, under Good Laboratory Practice conditions, of the genotoxicity of HNQ. HNQ was non-mutagenic in bacterial (Ames test) or mammalian (V79 hprt) assays. It was borderline positive in a mouse lymphoma tk mutation assay and a chromosome aberration test (CHO cells), results that may reflect a similar clastogenic mechanism. Negative in vivo genotoxicity results were noted in the rat hepatocyte in vivo/in vitro UDS test, in peripheral lymphocytes (chromosome aberrations) of rats receiving repeated oral doses of HNQ at the MTD for 28 days, and in mouse and hamster bone marrow chromosome aberration tests. However small, but statistically significant increases in the incidence of bone marrow micronuclei were observed in two out of five tests at 72 h after dosing, but not at 24 or 48 h. There was evidence of haematotoxicity at 72 h, which may have been enhanced by the vehicle (DMSO) used in the positive tests. As erythropoiesis and administration of haematotoxic agents are known to induce small increases in the frequency of bone marrow micronuclei, typically at delayed sampling times, the data suggest that the positive 72 h response produced by HNQ is consistent with stimulation of haematopoiesis subsequent to haematological toxicity of HNQ, and not due to a DNA-reactive mechanism. Overall, the weight of evidence suggests that Henna and HNQ pose no genotoxic risk to the consumer.","Is 2-Hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone mutagenic for TA98 strain?",False
1159,"Bisphenol A (4,4'-isopropylidenediphenol) is a common component of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Since bisphenol A-containing plastics and resins have found uses in food-contact items, its potential migration into foodstuffs and possible health consequences have been the focus of many recent studies. However, the potential mutagenic activation of bisphenol A by nitrosylation has received little attention. Incubation of bisphenol A with sodium nitrite under acidic conditions produced a yellow-brown product. When nitrosylated bisphenol A was tested in the Ames Salmonella/microsome assay at 100 ng to 1 mg/plate, dose-dependent increases in mutagenicity were found in both TA98 and TA100 Salmonella strains. These results indicated the presence of a direct-acting mutagenic activity causing both frameshift and base pair mutations, respectively. When compared to colony formation in untreated controls, the addition of rat liver S9 for metabolic activation had little influence on revertant colony formation. Unreacted bisphenol A dissolved in DMSO, acidic buffer, or inactivated nitrosylation solution showed negligible mutagenicity. When the nature of the mutagenic changes was examined using the Ames II trade mark Assay, a variety of base pair changes was found including T:A to A:T - S9, G:C to A:T +/- S9,C:G to A:T +/- S9 and C:G to G:C +/- S9. Bisphenol A also induced frameshift mutations at G:C sites. In addition, the presence of electrophiles was shown by the production of an intensely coloured orange-red product upon incubation of nitrosylated bisphenol A with the nucleophile 4-(4'-nitrobenzyl)pyridine. These findings suggest that migration of bisphenol A into nitrite containing foodstuffs, or its ingestion in the presence of nitrite, could lead to the formation of mutagenic compounds.",Is Bisphenol A mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1160,"Ethyl carbamate is a known carcinogen occurring in fermented food and beverages and is therefore of interest for food safety assurance. We studied the genotoxicity of ethyl carbamate in Salmonella typhimurium, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells. In absence of cytochrome P450 enzymes, no ethyl carbamate-mediated genotoxicity was observed in any of the three test systems in the non-cytotoxic range. In the presence of an activating system, ethyl carbamate was found to be mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 but not in strains TA98 and TA102, indicating base-pair substitutions at G-C base pairs. In contrast, no significant mutagenicity of ethyl carbamate could be detected in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells. However, applied in cytotoxic concentrations, ethyl carbamate was genotoxic for Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the absence of P450-mediated metabolic activation. Inhibitors of P450IIE1 (DMSO, ethanol and dithiodiethylcarbamate) diminished ethyl carbamate-mediated mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 in a dose dependent manner, suggesting that P450IIE1 is the activating enzyme.",Is Ethyl carbamate mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1161,"Extracts, isolated through sequential fractionation and partition procedures described previously (Martinez et al. 1994) from aflatoxin-free corn and aflatoxin-contaminated corn with and without ammonia treatment, were investigated for mutagenic potential using the Ames test (TA 100 tester strain). 2-Aminofluorene (2-AF) and pure aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) were used as positive controls. Although TA100 showed mutagenic response to pure AFB1 at a dose of ca 10 ng/plate, all isolates tested from ammonia-treated aflatoxin-contaminated corn containing 7500 ng AFB1/g did not exhibit positive results in the Ames test. Additionally, isolates from non-ammonia-treated aflatoxin-contaminated corn failed to give positive mutagenic potentials. These results indicate that differences between the mutagenic potentials of pure aflatoxins and of aflatoxins in naturally-contaminated corn exist. CH2Cl2 extracts (the fractions containing aflatoxins) obtained from aflatoxin-contaminated corn with and without ammonia treatment were applied to preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) in an effort to separate aflatoxins and/or ammonia/aflatoxin reaction products from the ""unknown interfering materials' existing in the corn matrix. Each of the fractions separated by TLC was tested by the Ames test with S9 activation and none of them gave a mutagenic response to TA100. CH2Cl2 extracts in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) obtained from non-ammonia-treated aflatoxin-free corn were spiked with pure AFB1 and tested by TA100 with S9 activation. Again, no positive responses were observed. These findings provide further evidence of ""unknown interfering materials' in corn which may bind with aflatoxin and/or can be extracted by CH2Cl2 together with aflatoxin, and, therefore, block the mutagenic activity of aflatoxin in the Ames test. Those materials were not separated from the aflatoxins by the TLC technique used in the present study. Possible reasons and further studies required to evaluate this phenomenon are discussed.",Is aflatoxin-contaminated corn mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
1162,"Nitroscanate (NSC) was found to be a direct acting mutagen in the Ames Salmonella tester strains TA100 and TA98 and this activity increased further in the presence of rat liver S9 mix. It was inactive in TA98NR and TA100NR, and weakly active in TA98/1,8-DNP6. A substantial fall in drug induced mutagenicity by pentachlorophenol, an inhibitor of acetyltransferase, in TA98, TA100 and YG1024 suggests the initial bioconversion of a nitro group to hydroxylamine and its further activation to the ultimate N-acetoxyarylamine. The refrigerated DMSO solution of the drug in the plate incorporation assay and freshly prepared solutions using the pre-incubation procedure indicated a fall in mutagenicity owing to the conversion of NSC to N,N'-bis-4-(p-nitrophenoxy)phenyl thiourea (NFPT). The drastic reduction in mutagenicity in the presence of 4-amino-4'-nitrodiphenyl ether (ANDE) and 4-aminodiphenyl ether (ADE) was also attributed to the conversion of NSC to the corresponding thiourea, a non-mutagen. The negligible mutagenicity of ANDE and its absence in ADE and 4-isothiocyanate diphenyl ether (ITDE) suggests that the mutagenicity of NSC is due to the nitro group, and the -NCS function is responsible for enhanced mutagenicity over nor-isothiocyanate 4-nitrodiphenyl ether (NDE).",Is 4-amino-4'-nitrodiphenyl ether mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1163,"Reconstituted non-fat dry milk powder, fermented by a mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus CH3 and Lactobacillus bulgaricus 191R to produce yogurt, was freeze-dried and extracted in acetone. After evaporation of the acetone, the extract was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and tested for antimutagenicity. In the Ames test, significant dose-dependent activity was observed against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), 4-nitro-quinoline-N-oxide (4NQO), 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB), 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benz[a]anthracene (DMBA), and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole acetate (Trp-P-2). Weak activity was observed against 1,2,7,8-diepoxyoctane (DEO), and no activity was observed against methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), or aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). In a related assay (Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7), significant antimutagenic activity was detected against MNNG and 4NQO. Activity against the experimental colon carcinogens MNNG and DMAB was examined further, as assayed in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA100). Compounds responsible for both activities were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in DMSO. Adjustment of yogurt pH to 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the amount of anti-MNNG activity recovered. In contrast, extractability of anti-DMAB activity was significantly greater at acidic pH. Conjugated linoleic acid, a known dairy anticarcinogen, failed to inhibit mutagenesis caused by either mutagen, suggesting that other yogurt-derived compound(s) are responsible. Unfermented milk was treated with lactic acid, yogurt bacteria without subsequent growth, or both, to determine if formation of antimutagenic activity required bacterial growth. Extracts of the milk treatments exhibited the same weak antimutagenicity observed in unfermented milk, approximately 2.5-fold less than in the yogurt extracts, suggesting that antimutagenic activity is associated with bacterial growth.",Is DMBA mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1164,"Three short-term tests were used; Salmonella/microsome assay, in vivo sister chromatid exchange assay (SCE) and micronucleus assay to evaluate mutagenic and genotoxic properties of 2,4,6-trichlorotriazine; cyanuric chloride. Mutagenicity assays were carried out using the standard top agar overplay plate assay described by Maron and Ames (9). Tester strains TA97a, TA98, TA100 and TA102 were used. Compound was dissolved in 0.1 ml of DMSO and doses of 1, 10, 100 and 500 micrograms/plate were tested in the absence and in the presence of the S9-mix. From the results obtained it appeared that incubation of the test substance with the bacteria did not increase the number of His+ revertants with any of the strains of S. typhimurium, either in the absence or in the presence of the S9-mix. At the high dose level used i.e. 100 and 500 micrograms/plate, the test substance appeared to be slightly toxic for strain TA 97a (in the absence of the S9-mix), as was seen from a diminished number of revertant colonies. The SCE test was performed according to the GENE-TOX programme. No significant increase was noted in the incidence of SCE in the groups treated with all tested doses of cyanuric chloride. Thus, in this test cyanuric chloride did not induce chromosomal damage resulting in SCE formation in bone marrow cells of mice. The micronucleus assay in vivo was performed on mice bone marrow cells. The incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes after administration of all doses of cyanuric chloride used were not statistically different (p > 0.05) as compared to negative controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Is 2,4,6-trichlorotriazine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?",False
1165,"Fecapentaenes form a class of potent fecal mutagens and have been suggested to play an initiating role in colon carcinogenesis. Although several indications have been found that fecapentaenes may induce oxidative DNA damage as well as DNA alkylation, the mechanism of genotoxicity remains unknown. In this study, electron spin resonance spectroscopy with several spin traps has been used in order to determine whether reactive oxygen species can be formed by fecapentaene-12 (FP-12). No specific conditions could be defined that resulted in the direct formation of oxygen radicals from FP-12. However, peroxidation of FP-12 by various peroxidative enzymes has been shown to result in the formation of superoxide adducts of the spin traps alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-t-butylnitrone and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO). Addition of superoxide dismutase resulted in a decreased spectrum intensity, whereas the hydroxyl radical scavenger t-butyl alcohol (tBA) appeared of no influence on the signal, both confirming the formation of superoxide. The formation of hydroxyl radical spin adducts has been demonstrated after peroxidation of FP-12 in incubations with the spin-trapping agent 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine (TMP). Further, the effects of scavenging hydroxyl radicals with respect to the genotoxic potential of FP-12 in the Salmonella mutagenicity assay has been investigated. It was clearly shown that radical scavenging reduced the number of revertants in Salmonella strains TA100, TA102 and TA104. This mutagenicity-reducing effect was more convincing using both spin traps DMPO and TMP as compared to the effect of hydroxyl radical scavengers tBA and DMSO. Based on these findings, a reaction scheme is proposed that suggests the formation of superoxide after peroxidation of FP-12, which is subsequently converted to hydroxyl radicals by the iron-catalysed Haber-Weiss reaction.",Is FP-12 mutagenic for TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1166,"To obtain insight into the identity of chemicals associated with the mutagenicity of United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Materials SRM 1649 (urban dust) and SRM 1650 (diesel particulate), parallel mutagenicity tests and chemical analyses were performed on dichloromethane and sequential organic extracts of these samples. SRM 1649 and 1650 were sequentially extracted with five organic solvents of increasing polarity, in order to partition mutagenic components into discrete fractions. The solvents (with associated polarity index) were as follows: (1) hexane (0.0); (2) hexane:diethyl ether 9:1 (0.29); (3) hexane:diethyl ether 1:1 (1.45); (4) diethyl ether (2.9); (5) methanol (6.6). 0.9270 g of SRM 1649, and 0.0510 g of SRM 1650 were each extracted three times with 8 ml of each of the solvents, the three aliquots were pooled, and analysed for target organics or solvent-exchanged into DMSO for mutagenicity testing in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. The dichloromethane extracts of SRM 1649 and SRM 1650 contained direct-acting mutagens in Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100; SRM 1650 was significantly more potent than SRM 1649 in either strain. Addition of S9 caused a large decrease in mutagenicity of each extract, although SRM 1650 remained more potent. An interesting pattern of mutagenicity was observed for the sequential extracts of SRM 1649 and SRM 1650: the mutagenic potency of SRM 1649 extracts increased with increasing polarity of the extraction solvent while the response of the SRM 1650 extracts was the opposite. This suggests that the direct-acting mutagens in SRM 1650 are unlike those in SRM 1649. The response, though diminished, was largely unchanged when S9 was included in the test mixture. Chemical analyses on the various extracts were performed using a Hewlett-Packard model 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a model 5970B mass selective detector (GC-MSD), and a 0.3 microns film thickness cross-linked methyl silicone capillary column (HP 1909A-101). Selected ion monitoring (SIM) methods were used to analyze for 105 target compounds including PAHs and nitro-PAHs. Chemical analysis of the dichloromethane extracts of SRM 1649 and SRM 1650 identified three main classes of compounds: polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), nitro-polyaromatic hydrocarbons (NO2-PAHs) and heterocyclics. The concentration of target compounds and the proportion of nitro-PAHs and heterocyclic compounds were considerably greater in SRM 1650 than in SRM 1649, consistent with the observed differences in their mutagenic potency. However, the different responses of the dichloromethane extracts in TA98 and TA100 suggest the presence of different (unidentified) compounds.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Is SRM 1649 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1167,"The results of in vitro genetic toxicology studies of sidestream cigarette smoke (SSCS) from cigarettes which heat but do not burn tobacco were compared to those of sidestream smoke from cigarettes which burn tobacco. SSCSs from 5 cigarettes were compared. Three of the cigarettes, the Kentucky reference research cigarette (1R4F), a commercially available ultra-low-tar brand (ULT) and a commercially available ultra-low-tar menthol brand (ULT-menthol) burn tobacco while two of the cigarettes, a regular (TEST) and a menthol (TEST-menthol) heat tobacco. SSCSs from all cigarettes were prepared by identical techniques, which involved collecting sidestream smoke particulate matter on Cambridge filter pads and combining the particulate matter with the vapor-phase materials collected by bubbling the smoke exiting the Cambridge pad through DMSO. The SSCSs obtained (equivalent to 0.4 cigarettes/ml DMSO) were evaluated at identical concentrations in an in vitro genetic toxicology test battery. SSCS from 1R4F, ULT and ULT-menthol cigarettes produced positive results in Ames bacterial strains TA98, TA100, TA1537 and TA1538 in the presence of metabolic activation (S9 from Aroclor-induced rat liver) but negative results in strain TA1535. In the absence of metabolic activation, 1R4F, ULT and ULT-menthol SSCSs were not significantly mutagenic. TEST and TEST-menthol SSCSs produced negative results in all 5 bacterial strains, both with and without metabolic activation. SSCS from 1R4F, ULT and ULT-menthol cigarettes produced positive results in the CHO chromosomal aberration assay and in the CHO sister-chromatid exchange assay both with and without metabolic activation while TEST and TEST-menthol SSCSs produced negative results in both assays, either with or without metabolic activation. The SSCSs from 1R4F, ULT and ULT-menthol cigarettes were weakly positive in inducing DNA repair in cultured rat hepatocytes while TEST and TEST-menthol SSCSs were negative in this assay. All 5 SSCSs were nonmutagenic in the CHO-HGPRT assay both with and without metabolic activation. SSCSs from the 1R4F, ULT and ULT-menthol cigarettes were cytotoxic in the CHO-HGPRT assay, both with and without metabolic activation, while TEST and TEST-menthol SSCSs were not cytotoxic under either condition. These results demonstrate that sidestream smoke from cigarettes which heat but do not burn tobacco (TEST and TEST-menthol) was neither genotoxic nor cytotoxic under conditions where sidestream smoke from cigarettes which burn tobacco (1R4F, ULT and ULT-menthol) was genotoxic and/or cytotoxic in a concentration-dependent manner.",Is ULT-menthol SSCSs mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False

This S9 activity is induced by administration of ethanol to the animals. The organic solvents dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (MP) inhibit this mutagenicity, apparently because they inhibit DMN demethylase activity (assayed as formaldehyde production). Ellagic acid, dissolved in DMSO or MP, had no inhibitory effect on DMN mutagenicity, beyond the effect of the solvent vehicle.",Is DMSO mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
1170,"Fly ash as a product of coal combustion is known to contain various mutagenic substances, but genotoxic properties, especially of the particular (larger-size) fly ash fraction which is electrostatically precipitated (ESP) in the energy plant, have hardly been investigated. While smaller-size fly ash particles escape through the stack during powder coal combustion, the ESP fraction is collected and used for the manufacturing, for instance according to the Lytag process, of secondary products which can serve several construction purposes. Since fly ash as well as fly ash products are generally introduced into the human environment, a study of possible genotoxic effects to human DNA is indicated. Mutagenic properties of ESP fly ash, as well as of the Lytag product, were investigated by means of the Salmonella microsome assay. The capacity to cause human chromosome damage of both ESP fly ash and Lytag dust was studied in vitro by application of the sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) test using human lymphocytes. Furthermore, effects of ESP fly ash/Lytag dust on the incidence of SCE in peripheral lymphocytes in vivo were measured in an occupationally exposed, male population, using individually matched employees from a flour-processing industry as the control population. It is demonstrated that ultrasonically treated DMSO extracts of ESP fly ash are slightly mutagenic to Salmonella tester strains TA97 and TA102. Lytag dust is effective in inducing reversions in all tester strains. Furthermore, it appeared that both compounds significantly increase the SCE frequency of human lymphocytes after incubation in vitro in comparison to non-exposed cells. Also, peripheral lymphocytes of the occupationally exposed population show a considerably higher incidence of SCE than the control population. Major disturbing factors in assessing the effects of occupational exposure to fly ash/Lytag dust on lymphocyte SCE frequency appeared to be smoking behavior and alcohol consumption. It is concluded that exposure to fly ash from powder coal combustion implies a moderate genotoxic risk to man.",Is ESP fly ash mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True
1171,"The effect of gamma-radiation on the mutagenicity potential of wood-smoked fish (Rastrelliger sp.) was investigated. Smoked fish were irradiated with radiation doses of 2.0, 4.0, 6.0 and 8.0 kGy. The DMSO extracts of non-radiated and irradiated smoked fish were tested for mutagenicity using the Ames plate incorporation assay, host-mediated assay, and the micronucleus test. It was observed that gamma-irradiation did not induce any significant increase in the number of revertants of TA98, TA100 and TA104 as compared with the non-radiated smoked fish. Results of the host-mediated assay and the micronucleus test showed no difference in the mutagenic response of non-radiated and irradiated smoked fish. The results indicate that gamma-radiation does not introduce mutagens in smoked fish.",Is gamma-radiation mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1172,"Dimethyl sulfoxide is a widely accepted and recommended solvent in which to dissolve compounds to be tested for mutagenicity via the Ames Salmonella/mammalian microsome assay. Using tester strains TA98 and TA100, we observed a bacteriotoxic response with various fractions isolated from beer when dissolved in DMSO but not when dissolved in water. Further characterization of the role of solvent in simple model systems consisting of butanol, DMSO and bacteria strongly suggests a chemical reaction occurs between dimethyl sulfoxide and specific chemical constituents of the test substance, nutrient broth, or the Ames bacterial strains. The result of such an interaction could be misinterpreted as a toxic response to the test substance when, in fact, the bacteriotoxicity could be due to another compound, chemically distinct from the test substance.",Is DMSO mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1173,"The urine of mice injected intraperitoneally with pyrene during exposure to NO2 was found to contain highly mutagenic compounds by means of the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98. The mice were exposed to 20 ppm NO2 for 3 days before intraperitoneal injection of pyrene (800 mg/kg of body weight). The pyrene-treated mice were further exposed to NO2 for an additional 24 hr, and the urine from the mice was collected in ice-cooled containers and stored frozen in the dark. The collected samples were treated with beta-glucuronidase and passed through activated Sep-Pack C18 cartridges. After elution with methanol, the effluent was concentrated and the residue was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The DMSO solution was fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography and the mutagenicity of each fraction was assayed with S. typhimurium strain TA98. The mutagenic compounds 3-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, 6-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, 8-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, and 1-hydroxypyrene were identified in the mutagenic fractions by mass spectrometry and UV-visible spectrophotometry with synthetic reference substances. These mutagenic compounds may have been formed by either nitration of hydroxylated pyrene, or hydroxylation of 1-nitropyrene, which is formed in vivo from pyrene and NO2, or the simultaneous occurrence of these two reactions in the mouse body.",Is 3-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1174,"Data from 38 laboratories using 5 strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA1538) were analyzed to determine sources and magnitudes of test data variability. Each laboratory tested the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide by the same protocol, using both its in-house cultures and a set of reference cultures provided to all laboratories. It was found that neither plate-to-plate nor day-to-day variability within a laboratory differed substantially between the in-house and reference cultures for any strain; this indicated no difference in the laboratories' handling of the two cultures. Not surprisingly, on average, plate-to-plate variability was substantially smaller than day-to-day variability within a laboratory, which, in turn, was substantially smaller than inter-laboratory variability. The solvent DMSO was found to have a small (6-7%) but statistically significant depressive effect on the spontaneous mutant frequency for the two plasmid-containing strains, TA98 and TA100, but not for the other three strains. When the mean value and variance of all laboratories for the in-house culture were compared with the corresponding reference culture values for each dose and strain, no major differences were seen. Any increase in mean or variance in the distribution of laboratory means in one of the two cultures could be ascribed largely to a small number of laboratories. Laboratories that reported 'high' or 'low' levels of spontaneous or induced revertants per plate tended to deviate in the same direction for most strains and for both in-house and reference cultures. If 'genetic drift' contributed to the inter-laboratory variability in this collaborative study, it was a minor component that went undetected in our analyses.",Is 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True

Two chemical procedures were used: extractions of aromatics for DMSO; elimination of acids, alcohols and phenols. Weak mutagenic activity was demonstrated at each temperature. Then, using only Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100, a study was made on the effects of the mutagenic compounds, benzo[a]pyrene, 2-aminoanthracene, nitrofluorene, methyl methanesulfonate and on the vapors and aerosols emitted at 350 degrees C by road-coating tar.

1176,"To investigate the interactions between mutagens and serum components, the mutagenicity of the serum extract of the organic matter derived from airborne particulates (tar) was examined by the Salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity test. The mutagens in the organic matter were found to be extracted with serum but not with saline. The mutagenic activity of the serum extract of the tar, however, decreased to about 60% compared with that of the DMSO extract, when they were activated by S9 mix. On the other hand, without S9 mix, the mutagenic activities of the serum and DMSO extracts were about the same. Gel filtration of the serum extract was carried out and followed by mutagenicity testing of each fraction. It is suggested that the mutagens, which require metabolic activation, combine mainly with beta-lipoproteins and the direct mutagens with both alpha- and beta-lipoproteins in serum.",Is tar mutagenic for nan strain?,True
1177,"Hexachloroacetone, CCl3--CO--CCl3, reverts the Ames strains TA98 and TA100 but not the non-plasmid strains TA1537, TA1535 and TA1538. In the absence of solvent, the number of revertant colonies is 5 times the spontaneous reversion rate for TA100 and 10 times the spontaneous reversion rate for TA98 with 26 mg hexachloroacetone per plate. This effect is seen in the absence of rat liver microsomes. In dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solution a more complicated pattern is seen. In DMSO solution cooled between 18 and 20 degrees C, The maximum nuber of revertants is similar to that found in the absence of DMSO, but only 1.75 mg hexachloroacetone per plate is needed. When DMSO solution of hexachloroacetone is warmed above 20 degrees C, a yellow color develops and the solution becomes more toxic to the test bacteria. The maximum number of revertants is then produced at about 0.5 mg hexachloroacetone per plate. Hexachloroacetone is found to be active, without microsomal activation, in the E. coli WP-2 and E. coli rec-BC test systems. Hexachloroacetone readily reacts with water in DMSO solutions to form the non-mutagenic hexachloroacetone hydrate.",Is Hexachloroacetone mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
1178,"Mutagenicity assays were carried out in the Salmonella/microsome test, using five S. typhimurium his(-) strains (TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98 and TA100), both in the presence and absence of post-mitochondrial preparations from Aroclor-induced rat livers and suitable co-factors. Seven oil dispersants showed a wide range of toxicity towards the bacterial strains, without eliciting any mutagenic response at sub-lethal concentrations. One sample of crude oil and its dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) extract were also negative, and no mutagenic effect could be detected by checking mixtures of crude oil with each of the seven dispersants tested. Two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, benzo(a)pyrene (BP) and benz(a) anthracene (BA), which are generally considered to be the most documented carcinogenic components of crude oil, were mutagenic with a frameshift mechanism, requiring metabolic activation. BP mutagenicity was not affected by oil dispersants nor by seawater. Conversely, the mutagenicity of BP DMSO-solutions was abolished in the presence either of whole crude oil, of its DMSO extract, or of crude oil/dispersant mixtures. These losses of mutagenicity could be mainly ascribed to a mechanical trapping of BP by oil components.",Is BP mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
1179,"Mutagenic and genotoxic effects of dicapthon were investigated by using the bacterial reverse mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102 strains with or without metabolic activation system (S9 mix), and chromosome aberrations (CAs), sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), and micronucleus (MN) tests in human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro. Dicapthon was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide for all test systems. 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 μg/plate doses of dicapthon were found to be weakly mutagenic on S. typhimurium TA 98 without S9 mix. The human peripheral lymphocytes were treated with four experimental concentrations of dicapthon (25, 50, 100, and 200 μg/mL) for 24 and 48 h. Dicapthon increased the frequency of SCE only at the 100 μg/mL concentration for the 24 and 48 h applications. Dicapthon also induced abnormal cell frequency, CA/cell ratio and frequency of MN dose dependently for 24 and 48 h. Dicapthon showed a statistically significant cytotoxic effect by decreasing the mitotic index in all concentrations and a cytostatic effect by decreasing nuclear division index in 100 and 200 μg/mL concentrations for both treatment periods when compared with both untreated and solvent controls. These values decreased also in a dose dependent manner. ",Is Dicapthon mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1180,"An assay for the ability of antioxidants to prevent mutations induced by various oxidants in Salmonella typhimurium TA102 cells was developed. Protection against hydrogen-peroxide-induced mutagenicity was observed for quercetin, caffeic acid, ascorbic acid and dimethyl sulfoxide (used as a solvent for water-insoluble antioxidants). No protective effect was observed for green tea extract (weakly pro-oxidative), catechin, rutin, sinigrin, ferulic acid and alpha-tocopherol. Mutagenicity caused by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH) was prevented most effectively by quercetin and ascorbic acid, whereas weaker effects were observed for green tea extract and for rutin, and no effect being observed for the other antioxidants tested. The results for hydrogen peroxide indicate iron chelation to be the most important protective mechanism. Radical scavenging appeared to be effective only with dimethyl sulfoxide and ascorbic acid, which are effective scavengers of hydroxyl radicals and were used here in high concentrations. It is proposed that the hydrogen-peroxide-induced mutations in the Salmonella cells are caused by hydroxyl radicals generated by iron ions closely associated with DNA. Protection against mutagenicity caused by tert-butyl hydroperoxide appears to occur mainly through the scavenging of alkoxyl and possibly of alkyl radicals.",Is tert-butyl hydroperoxide mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True
1181,"Cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of root canal filling cements of various chemical composition were determined in vitro. Materials set for 24 h and 1 wk were eluted for 24 h in cell culture medium (cytotoxicity testing) and dimethyl sulfoxide or physiological saline (mutagenicity testing). The differences between cytotoxic potencies of eluates of the endodontic materials on L-929 cells were quantified colorimetrically (MTT test). Eluates of Traitement SPAD were about 5- to 30-fold more toxic than silver-free AH26, Tubli-Seal, CRCS, and Endomethsone N. The rank order of the toxic effects depended on the setting time of mixed materials. Dimethyl sulfoxide and saline eluates of Traitement SPAD, Tubli-Seal, Endomethasone N, CRCS, and Ketac-Endo were not mutagenic in the Ames test. Both eluates of silver-free AH26 set for 24 h were weakly mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA100. Weak mutagenicity of saline eluates of the material was also observed in TA97a and TA102. These results point to the possibility that mixed silver-free AH26 might contain small amounts of two mutagenic substances: bisphenol A diglycidyl ether and formaldehyde.",Is eluates of silver-free AH26 mutagenic for TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1182,"The Salmonella mutagenicity assay has been used to investigate the mutagenicity of cigarette smoke and cigarette smoke condensate. The Kentucky reference (K1R4F) cigarette is designed to be representative of full-flavor, low-tar cigarettes sold in the U.S. and to serve as a reference standard for comparative studies on the chemistry and biological activities of cigarette smoke and condensate. The objective of this study was to determine if the mutagenicity of mainstream smoke condensate from the K1R4F, as measured by the Salmonella mutagenicity assay, is representative of the mutagenic activity of U.S. cigarettes. Mainstream smoke condensates prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide from the K1R4F and 73 brand styles (representing greater than 70% of the total U.S. cigarette market) were assayed using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 (+S9) at concentrations of 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125 and 250 micrograms/plate. Revertants/mg condensate were determined by calculating the slopes of the dose-response curves using linear and nonlinear regression models. Revertants/cigarette were determined by multiplying the revertants/mg condensate by the mg condensate/cigarette. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed between the mean mutagenicity of U.S. market and K1R4F mainstream smoke condensates in terms of revertants/mg condensate or revertants/cigarette. Increased variability in mutagenicity was observed among the U.S. brands versus that of the K1R4F. This is not surprising since variability among the U.S. brands would be expected to have both measurement error and brand style variability while the K1R4F variability contains only the measurement error portion. These results demonstrate that the K1R4F is a representative model for the U.S. cigarette market in comparative Salmonella mutagenicity studies using mainstream smoke condensates.",Is K1R4F mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1183,"Aside from the considerable number of reports on the physical and chemical properties of dental bonding agents, information concerning their biologic effects is sparse. Three dentin bonding agents (Prisma Universal Bond, Pertac Universal Bond, and Syntac) and the ingredients methylmethacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate, and glutaraldehyde were investigated in the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity test system using five different bacterial strains (TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102, and TA104). The materials as well as the ingredients were eluted in both dimethyl sulfoxide and physiologic saline, and serially diluted eluates were used in the plate incorporation test. Pertac Universal Bond and Prisma Universal Bond did not elicit any mutagenic effects in any of the bacterial strains. In contrast, Syntac adhesive showed clear mutagenicity in S. typhimurium strain TA102. Dimethyl sulfoxide eluates, as well as physiologic saline eluates of the Syntac bonding agent, caused numbers of revertants that were about 6 times higher than control values. Reversion rates with other strains were moderately enhanced. Glutaraldehyde, an ingredient of Syntac adhesives, caused mutagenicity in a manner similar to Syntac adhesive eluates. Neither 2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate nor methylmethacrylate monomer was found to be mutagenic over a broad concentration range.",Is methylmethacrylate mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
1184,"Nitric oxide (NO) is produced both by macrophages in vivo as a physiological response to infection and by a variety of cell types as an intercellular messenger. In addition, NO and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are significant components of many combustion processes. The ubiquitous exposure of humans to nitrogen oxides (NOx), both endogenously and exogenously, may play a significant role in the carcinogenic process due to nitrosation of amines by NOx. We report here that exposure to low concentrations of NO, alone or in combination with NO2, results in significantly enhanced mutation in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 using a modified Ames Salmonella reversion assay. The observed mutagenicity requires that the bacteria be actively dividing at the time of exposure to NO or NO2, suggesting that the nitrogen oxides, or their reaction products, function as direct-acting mutagens and that the induced lesion is easily repairable by non-dividing cells. Exposure to NO resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in the number of revertants approximately proportional to the square of the NO concentration from 0 to 20 ppm. NO was a more effective mutagen relative to NO2, however, the observed requirement for O2 suggests limited oxidation of NO (presumably to NO2) is necessary. Numerous lipid- and aqueous-phase inhibitors of nitrosation, as well as a number of other general antioxidants and free-radical trapping agents, were examined for their effectiveness in blocking the mutagenic effects of NO. The mutagenic activity of NO was most effectively inhibited by beta-carotene and tocopherols. BHT, dimethyl sulfoxide and mannitol also blocked the mutagenic effects of NOx but appeared less effective than beta-carotene or vitamin E, while ascorbate was ineffective as an inhibitor of mutation resulting from NO exposure.",Is NO mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
1185,"We have examined the effects of three buffers--Vogel-Bonner minimal E (VBM) and 0.15 and 0.015 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4--and two concentrations of overnight cells (5x and 10x) on the mutagenicity of two pure compounds and two complex mixtures in strain TA98 using a modification of a microsuspension assay developed by Kado et al. (Mutation Research 121:25-32, 1983). The assay was performed by adding 50 microliters of cell concentrate of an overnight culture of TA98 resuspended in the appropriate buffer; 50 microliters of the same buffer or S9 mix; and 2 microliters of mutagen or dimethyl sulfoxide to a 1-dram vial or 13 x 150-mm test tube. The suspension was incubated for 90 min at 37 degrees C, top agar was added, and the contents poured onto a bottom agar of minimal medium. Cell concentration (5x vs. 10x) had little effect on the mutagenic potencies of the agents tested. The mutagenic potencies of the direct-acting agents (1-nitropyrene and diesel exhaust) were consistently lower with 0.15 M buffer compared to the mutagenic potencies of these agents with the other two buffers. The three buffers gave similar results for the indirect-acting agents (2-aminoanthracene and environmental tobacco smoke). The 0.15 M buffer was considerably cytotoxic in the absence of S9, which may explain why the direct-acting agents were less potent with this buffer compared to the other buffers. VBM was also somewhat cytotoxic, but this did not appear to affect the mutagenic potencies of the agents studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Is VBM mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1186,"The umu test system is a newly developed method to evaluate genotoxic activities of a wide variety of environmental carcinogens and mutagens (Oda et al., 1985). In the present study, we further examined the abilities of 151 chemicals to induce umu gene expression in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. Among the chemicals examined, 72 compounds induced umu gene expression, which could be defined on a basis of increased beta-galactosidase activity by 2-fold over the background level. The potent genotoxic compounds without metabolic activation were adriamycin, bleomycin, daunorubicin, 1,3-dinitropyrene, 1,6-dinitropyrene, 1,8-dinitropyrene, N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, furylfuramide, methyl methanesulfonate, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, mitomycin C, 1-nitropyrene and 4-nitroquino-line-1-oxide. In the presence of S9, aflatoxin B1, 2-aminoanthracene, Glu-P-1, IQ, MeIQ, MeIQx, Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 also induced umu gene expression markedly. Several chemicals such as 2-acetylaminofluorene, 9-aminoacridine, azobenzene, benzanthracene, benzidine, diethyl nitrosamine, 1-nitronaphthalene, paraquat, potassium dichromate and sodium nitrite were weakly genotoxic and the induction by these compounds could be detected only when the incubation time was prolonged from 2 h to 5 h. Data are also presented that some of the chemicals such as dimethyl sulfoxide, m-dioxan, 5-fluorouracil and paraquat, which have been reported to be non-mutagenic in Ames/Salmonella assay, were found to be active in inducing umu gene expression, while the known mutagenic compounds including acrylonitrile, 4,4'-dinitrobiphenyl, furfural, methylene chloride, 1-naphthylamine, sodium azide, o-tolidine and o-toluidine were non-genotoxic in the present assay system.",Is dimethyl sulfoxide mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,False
1187,"The urine of mice injected intraperitoneally with pyrene during exposure to NO2 was found to contain highly mutagenic compounds by means of the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98. The mice were exposed to 20 ppm NO2 for 3 days before intraperitoneal injection of pyrene (800 mg/kg of body weight). The pyrene-treated mice were further exposed to NO2 for an additional 24 hr, and the urine from the mice was collected in ice-cooled containers and stored frozen in the dark. The collected samples were treated with beta-glucuronidase and passed through activated Sep-Pack C18 cartridges. After elution with methanol, the effluent was concentrated and the residue was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The DMSO solution was fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography and the mutagenicity of each fraction was assayed with S. typhimurium strain TA98. The mutagenic compounds 3-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, 6-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, 8-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, and 1-hydroxypyrene were identified in the mutagenic fractions by mass spectrometry and UV-visible spectrophotometry with synthetic reference substances. These mutagenic compounds may have been formed by either nitration of hydroxylated pyrene, or hydroxylation of 1-nitropyrene, which is formed in vivo from pyrene and NO2, or the simultaneous occurrence of these two reactions in the mouse body.",Is 3-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1188,"The influence of organic solvents on the mutagenicity of 11 N-nitrosamines was examined in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 using the Ames's liquid incubation assay in the presence of rat-liver S9. The mutagenic activities of N-nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosodiethylamine, 6 oxidative derivatives of N-nitrosopropylamine and N-nitroso-2,6-dimethylmorpholine were considerably decreased by addition of dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl formamide, acetone, 95% ethanol or acetonitrile, which are recommended for use as solvents in the assay by Ames's group, to the incubation mixture. The mutagenic activities of N-nitrosodipropylamine and N-nitrosodibutylamine, which are barely soluble in water, were also suppressed by increasing concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide. These organic solvents did not appear to exert their influence by desmutagenic and antimutagenic actions. In contrast, the recoveries of unmetabolized carcinogens from preincubation mixtures and from agar plates were significantly higher in the presence of organic solvents than in their absence. The results indicate that the inhibitory effect is a result of interference with the process of metabolic activation by liver S9.",Is N-nitrosodipropylamine mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1189,"Paper strips containing indicator dyes have been developed by defence scientists to change color upon exposure to certain agents but not to common solvents. As a preliminary step in studies on their possible genetic or carcinogenic hazard, 6 dyes used in these detection papers were tested with the Salmonella/mammalian-microsome assay. The 3 nitro arenes tested were found to be mutagenic. Two of them, Orasol Navy Blue 2RB (without metabolic activation) and Eastman Fast Blue B-GLF (with metabolic activation), induced higher yields of mutations in the frameshift revertible strains, but base substitution mutations also were found. The third nitro arene, ethyl-bis-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) acetate, induced only frameshift reversions, the greatest yields without metabolic activation. Because of weak but consistent mutagenic activation. Because of weak but consistent mutagenic effects with a fourth dye, thiodiphenyl-4,4'-diazo-bis-salicylic acid, fluctuation tests using Salmonella strain TA98 were performed, and dose-related, statistically-significant mutagenic responses were observed. Two remaining dyes, Fluorescent Brilliant Yellow R and 2,5,2',5'-tetramethyltriphenylmethane-4,4'-diazo-bis-beta-hydroxynaphthoic anilide, were not mutagenic in experiments using doses extending into the toxic range. Spot tests were performed on different paper strips containing the dyes. When the papers were eluted with dimethyl sulfoxide, responses were found to be qualitatively similar to those in the plate tests. Although microbial test results cannot be used to assess risk in man, these results indicate a potential mutagenic or carcinogenic hazard for individuals exposed to these dyes, especially the nitro aromatics.","Is thiodiphenyl-4,4'-diazo-bis-salicylic acid mutagenic for TA98 strain?",True
1190,"Cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of root canal filling cements of various chemical composition were determined in vitro. Materials set for 24 h and 1 wk were eluted for 24 h in cell culture medium (cytotoxicity testing) and dimethyl sulfoxide or physiological saline (mutagenicity testing). The differences between cytotoxic potencies of eluates of the endodontic materials on L-929 cells were quantified colorimetrically (MTT test). Eluates of Traitement SPAD were about 5- to 30-fold more toxic than silver-free AH26, Tubli-Seal, CRCS, and Endomethsone N. The rank order of the toxic effects depended on the setting time of mixed materials. Dimethyl sulfoxide and saline eluates of Traitement SPAD, Tubli-Seal, Endomethasone N, CRCS, and Ketac-Endo were not mutagenic in the Ames test. Both eluates of silver-free AH26 set for 24 h were weakly mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA100. Weak mutagenicity of saline eluates of the material was also observed in TA97a and TA102. These results point to the possibility that mixed silver-free AH26 might contain small amounts of two mutagenic substances: bisphenol A diglycidyl ether and formaldehyde.",Is Tubli-Seal mutagenic for TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
1191,"Two oral contraceptive steroids, mestranol and norethynodrel, were evaluated for mutagenicity in the Salmonella histidine reversion assay. The pure forms of the hormones were not mutagenic when tested with either missense (TA1535, TA100) or frameshift (TA98, TA1538, TA1537) strains. In vitro activation of the hormones with liver homogenates from rats induced either with phenobarbital or Aroclor did not influence these results. However, mestranol was capable of enhancing the mutation yield obtained by an ineffective subthreshold dose of 2-acetylaminofluorene. Dimethyl sulfoxide extracts of two contraceptive pills, Ovulen-21 (containing mestranol) or Enovid-E (containing mestranol or norethynodrel), also were nonmutagenic. But again, both these extracts were capable of enhancing the mutation yield induced with an ineffective dosage of 2-acetylaminofluorene and N-nitrosopiperidine. These studies point to the possible promotional effect and subsequent potential hazard to the female consumers who use these hormones as a means of pregnancy control.",Is Enovid-E mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
1192,"37 dyes including 3 anthraquinone, 22 azo; 5 xanthene, 5 fluorandiol, and 2 thioindigo dyes, were tested for mutagenic potential with the Salmonella/mammalian-microsome test. Two frame-shift histidine mutants (TA1537 and TA98) and two base-pair substituted histidine mutants (TA1535 and TA100) of Salmonella typhimurium were employed. Both the spot test and the plate-incorporation assay indicated that one azo dye, D&C Orange No. 17, was mutagenic with three of the bacterial test strains. The mutagenic response of D&C Orange No. 17 was depressed by the addition of the microsomal fractions from rat livers. Of the chemicals used to synthesize D&C Orange No; 17 was depressed by the addition of the microsomal fractions from rat livers. Of the chemicals used to synthesize D&C Orange No. 17, beta-naphthol was not mutagenic but 2,4-dinitroaniline was mutagenic to the same Salmonella strains as D&C Orange No. 17 . Dimethyl sulfoxide extracts of lipsticks of similar formula but without D&C Orange No. 17 were tested in the plate incorporation assay. Only those containing D&C Orange No. 17 were mutagenic and the dye was mutagenic at concentrations consumed in normal daily use.",Is Dimethyl sulfoxide mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
1193,"Mutagenicity of five benzene metabolites was examined by a fluctuation test modified by Gatehouse. The test was performed by using Salmonella typhimurium TA100 with or without a metabolic activation system. Catechol showed mutagenic activity with and without a metabolic activation system in the fluctuation test. Hydroxyhydroquinone, phenol, hydroquinone and p-benzoquinone were positive only with a metabolic activation system in this test. The Ames' plate method and preincubation method are widely used as a screening test for the mutagenic compounds. However, the fluctuation test is very useful in detecting mutagenic activity of chemicals which are negative in the Ames test though being a mutagen or carcinogen.",Is Hydroxyhydroquinone mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1194,"Emodin is a naturally occurring anthraquinone present in the roots and bark of numerous plants of the genus Rhamnus. Extracts from the roots, bark, and/or dried leaves of buckthorn, senna, cascara, aloe, frangula, and rhubarb have been used as laxatives since ancient times and currently are widely used in the preparation of herbal laxative preparations. Anthraquinone glycosides are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but are cleaved by gut bacteria to produce aglycones (such as emodin) that are more readily absorbed and are responsible for the purgative properties of these preparations. There is extensive exposure to emodin and other anthraquinones resulting from the use of herb-based stimulant laxatives. Reports that 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone, a commonly used laxative ingredient, caused tumors in the gastrointestinal tract of rats raised the possibility of an association between colorectal cancer and the use of laxatives containing anthraquinones. Because emodin is a hydroxyanthraquinone structurally similar to 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone, is present in herbal laxatives, and was reported to be mutagenic in bacteria, it was considered a potential carcinogen and was selected for in-depth evaluation. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to emodin (at least 94% pure) in feed for 16 days, 14 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, rat and mouse bone marrow cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 16-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Groups of five male and five female rats were fed diets containing 0, 600, 2,000, 5,500, 17,000, or 50,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 50, 170, 480, 1,400, or 3,700 mg emodin/kg body weight to males and 50, 160, 460, 1,250, or 2,000 mg/kg to females) for 15 (males) or 16 (females) days. Three female rats died before the end of the study. Mean body weights of males and females exposed to 5,500 ppm or greater were significantly less than those of the controls. Feed consumption by males and females receiving 17,000 or 50,000 ppm was decreased throughout the study. Macroscopic lesions were present in the kidney of rats exposed to 17,000 or 50,000 ppm. 16-DAY STUDY IN MICE: Groups of five male and five female mice were fed diets containing 0, 600, 2,000, 5,500, 17,000, or 50,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 120, 400, 1,200, or 3,800 mg/kg to males and 140, 530, 1,600, or 5,000 mg/kg to females; 50,000 ppm equivalents were not calculated due to high mortality) for 15 (males) or 16 (females) days. All mice exposed to 50,000 ppm died before the end of the study. Mice in the 17,000 ppm groups lost weight during the study. Feed consumption by 5,500 ppm females was greater than that by the controls throughout the study. Macroscopic lesions were present in the gallbladder and kidney of mice exposed to 17,000 ppm. 14-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 312.5, 625, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 20, 40, 80, 170, or 300 mg/kg to males and females) for 14 weeks. Mean body weights of males exposed to 2,500 ppm or greater and females exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater were significantly less than those of the controls. During the first week of the study, feed consumption by males exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm and females exposed to 5,000 ppm was less than that by the controls. Feed consumption by these groups was similar to that by the controls for the remainder of the study. In rats exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm, there were increases in platelet counts in males and females and segmented neutrophil counts in females. Total serum protein and albumin concentrations were decreased in females exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm. Relative kidney weights of rats exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater and relative lung weights of rats exposed to 625 ppm or greater were significantly increased compared to the control groups. Relative liver weights were incree increased in females exposed to 625 ppm or greater. The estrous cycle length wassignificantly increased in females exposed to 1,250 or 5,000 ppm. All male rats exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater and all exposed female rats had pigment in the renal tubules; and the severity of pigmentation generally increased with increasing exposure concentration. The incidences of hyaline droplets in the cortical epithelial cytoplasm were increased in all groups of exposed males and in females exposed to 312.5, 625, or 1,250 ppm. 14-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were fed diets containing 0, 312.5, 625, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approxi mately 50, 100, 190, 400, or 800 mg/kg to males and 60, 130, 240, 500, or 1,100 mg/kg to females) for 14 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. Mean body weights of males exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm were significantly less than those of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed groups was generally similar to that by the controls. Relative kidney weights of male mice exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater, relative lung weights of males exposed to 625 ppm or greater, and relative liver weights of female mice exposed to 625 ppm or greater were increased. The incidences and severities of nephropathy were increased in males and females exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater. The incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in males exposed to 625 ppm or greater and in females exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 65 male and 65 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 280, 830, or 2,500 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 110, 320, or 1,000 mg/kg to males and 120, 370, or 1,100 mg/kg to females) for 105 weeks. Ten male and ten female rats from each group were necropsied at 6 months. Blood samples from five male and five female rats in each group were evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months for plasma emodin concentrations; these rats were necropsied at 12 months. Survival, Body Weights, and Feed Consumption: Survival of exposed males and females was similar to that of the controls. The mean body weights of rats in the 2,500 ppm groups were less than those of the controls beginning at week 2 of the study. Feed consumption by exposed groups was similar to that by the controls throughout the study. Pathology Findings: Three Zymbal's gland carcinomas were observed in female rats exposed to 2,500 ppm. This incidence exceeded the range observed for current historical controls and was considered an equivocal finding. At the 6- and 12-month interim evaluations and at 2 years, emodin-related increases in the incidences of renal tubule hyaline droplets occurred in all exposed groups. The incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males at 2 years. There were negative trends in the incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats, and the incidences in the 2,500 ppm groups were significantly decreased. In females exposed to 2,500 ppm, the incidence was below the historical control range; the incidence in males exposed to 2,500 ppm was at the lower end of the historical control range. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 60 male mice were fed diets containing 0, 160, 312, or 625 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 15, 35, or 70 mg/kg) for 105 weeks. Groups of 60 female mice were fed diets containing 0, 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 30, 60, or 120 mg/kg) for 105 weeks. Ten male and ten female mice from each group were necropsied at 12 months. Survival, Body Weights, and Feed Consumption Survival and mean body weights of exposed males and females were similar to those of the controls. No differences in feed consumption were noted between exposed and control groups. Pathology Findings: Low incidences of renal tubule adenoma and carcinoma occurred in exposed male mice; these incidences included one carcinoma each in the 312 and 625 ppm groups. Renal tubule neoplasms are rare in male mice, and their presence in these groups suggested a possible association with emodin exposure. At the 12-month interim evaluation, the severity of nephropathy was slightly increased in males exposed to 625 ppm. Also at 12 months, the severity of nephropathy increased from minimal in the lower exposure groups to mild in females exposed to 1,250 ppm; the incidence in this group was significantly increased compared to the control group. At 2 years, the severities of nephropathy were slightly increased in males exposed to 625 ppm and females exposed to 1,250 ppm. The incidences of nephropathy were significantly increased in all exposed groups of females. At the 12-month interim evaluation, the incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males and in females exposed to 625 or 1,250 ppm. The severities increased with increasing exposure concentration. At 2 years, the incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in all exposed groups; severities increased with increasing exposure concentration. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Emodin was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 in the presence of S9 activation; no mutagenicity was detected in strain TA98, with or without S9. Chromosomal aberrations were induced in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells treated with emodin, with and without S9. Three separate in vivo micronucleus tests were performed with emodin. A male rat bone marrow micronucleus test, with emodin administered by three intraperitoneal injections, gave negative results. Results of acute-exposure (intraperitoneal injection) micronucleus tests in bone marrow and peripheral blood erythrocytes of male and female mice were negative. In a peripheral blood micronucleus test on mice from the 14-week study, negative results were seen in male mice, but a weakly positive response was observed in similarly exposed females. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in male F344/N rats exposed to 280, 830, or 2,500 ppm. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in female F344/N rats based on a marginal increase in the incidence of Zymbal's gland carcinoma. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in male B6C3F1 mice based on a low incidence of uncommon renal tubule neoplasms. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in female B6C3F1 mice exposed to 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm. Exposure of rats to emodin resulted in increased incidences of renal tubule hyaline droplets and pigmentation in males, increased incidences of renal tubule hyaline droplets in females, and increased severities of renal tubule pigmentation in males and females. Emodin exposure resulted in increased incidences of renal tubule pigmentation in male and female mice and increased incidences of nephropathy in female mice. Incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia decreased in male and female rats exposed to 2,500 ppm. Synonyms: Archin; C.I. 75440; C.I. Natural Green 2; C.I.

1195,"Bottom sediment and suspended sediment samples from Hamilton Harbour (western Lake Ontario) and from a major tributary were profiled using a bioassay-directed fractionation approach. Sample extracts were fractionated using an alumina/Sephadex gel clean-up procedure to afford non-polar aromatic fractions which were characterized using chemical analyses and the Ames/microsome bacterial assay in Salmonella typhimurium strains YG1025 with the addition of oxidative metabolism (S9), and YG1024 without S9. Non-polar aromatic fractions of selected samples were separated by normal phase HPLC into 1-min fractions which were subjected to bioassay analyses. The bioassays using strain YG1025+S9, a TA100-type strain, were performed to assess genotoxicity arising from the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Fractions which exhibited mutagenic activity contained PAH with molecular masses of 252, 276 and 278 amu; these fractions contained over 80% of the genotoxicity attributable to PAH. Individual compounds identified using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry analyses in these active fractions included benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[cd]pyrene and dibenz[a,h]anthracene. The YG1025+S9 mutagenic activity profiles were similar for all samples. Mutagenic activity profiles generated using strain YG1024-S9, a TA98-type strain sensitive to compounds characteristic of mobile source emissions, were very different. The mutagenic activities in strain YG1024-S9 were greatest for harbour-suspended sediment samples collected from sites impacted by a major tributary. Suspended sediments collected near areas known to contain high levels of coal tar-contamination in the bottom sediments contained higher levels of genotoxic PAH than suspended sediments collected from other areas of the harbour.",Is samples from Hamilton Harbour mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1196,"The polychlorinated pesticide toxaphene has been identified as a persistent environmental contaminant and is of particular concern in the Great Lakes and Arctic regions of Canada. Inconsistencies in published in vitro genotoxicology studies have hindered risk assessments of toxaphene exposure. When toxaphene mutagenicity was re-evaluated in the Ames Salmonella/microsome assay at 10-10,000 microg/plate, a dose-dependent increase in His revertants occurred in all five strains of S. typhimurium tested (TA97, TA98, TA100, TA102 and TA104) with higher mutation frequencies observed in the absence of S9 metabolic activation. However, the mutagenic potential of toxaphene was relatively low with concentrations greater than 500 microg/plate required to induce mutation. Toxaphene genotoxicity was also examined in a mammalian system using Chinese hamster V79 lung fibroblasts with metabolic activation provided by human HepG2 hepatoma cells. Genotoxicity of 1-10 microg/ml toxaphene was examined by measuring the frequency of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and mutation induction at the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) gene locus. Although small increases in SCE were observed at toxic concentrations of toxaphene approaching the LD50 (10 microg/ml), they were not found to be statistically significant relative to control. Toxaphene was also unable to induce HGPRT mutagenesis at the concentrations tested. These results show that while toxaphene is a weak, direct-acting mutagen in the Ames Salmonella Test, convincing evidence of dose-dependent SCE induction and mutagenicity at the HGPRT gene locus could not be demonstrated in V79 cells.",Is toxaphene mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1197,"We have studied the mutagenicity of the water from Lake Bloomington and of the tap water that is made from the lake water. The lake, which is the source of drinking water for Bloomington, Illinois (pop. 44,000), is surrounded by land that is farmed intensively--being mainly in maize and soybeans. Samples were collected monthly from May through October 1979 and concentrated 3,000X with XAD-2 resin. Nearly all of the lake and tap water concentrates were mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 in the presence of S-9 mix, and the May tap water concentrate was highly mutagenic. In addition, many of the concentrates were toxic to the bacteria in the absence of S-9 mix. Chemical analysis of the highly mutagenic tap water concentrate from May revealed the presence of a number of organic contaminants that were absent from control concentrates prepared from deionized and distilled treated-well water. In addition, unconcentrated lake and tap water were tested in a reverse-mutation test in maize (Zea mays); no mutagenicity was detected. This study indicates that the contamination of drinking water with agricultural and/or industrial chemicals may result in a potential health hazard.",Is tap water concentrate mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1198,"The mutagenicity of 24 benzyl derivatives, containing a variety of substituents and leaving groups, were assayed in strain TA100 using the Ames plate-incorporation assay. p-Nitrobenzyl chloride (12 000 revertants/mumole), p-nitrobenzyl tosylate (6100 revertants/mumole), and p-acetoxybenzyl chloride (100 revertants/mumole) were mutagenic; none of the remaining 21 compounds were mutagenic. p-Nitrobenzyl chloride was also found to be mutagenic in strain TA98 (700 revertants/mumole), but not in strain TA98NR (a strain deficient in nitro reductase activity). p-Acetoxybenzyl chloride was nonenzymatically hydrolyzed to p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol and p-acetoxybenzyl alcohol. These findings suggest that nitrobenzyl derivatives were mutagenic due to nitro reductive metabolism and that p-acetoxybenzyl chloride was mutagenic due to the intermediate formation of p-hydroxybenzyl chloride during the hydrolysis of p-acetoxybenzyl chloride.",Is p-Acetoxybenzyl chloride mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1199,"Xanthine oxidase catalyzed mutagenicity of 4-nitrobiphenyl (NBP), a dog-bladder carcinogen, was tested in Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 strains. NBP was active as a mutagen in the parent strain TA98 which is proficient in nitroreductase, while it was inactive in the strain TA98NR which is deficient in nitroreductase. However, preincubation of NBP at 37 degrees C with NADH and commercial preparations of xanthine oxidase for 30 min resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the mutagenic activity in TA98NR. Allopurinol blocked the xanthine oxidase catalyzed mutagenicity of NBP in TA98NR and the extent of inhibition was dependent upon the concentration of the inhibitor. Rat-liver and dog-bladder cytosol preparations also enhanced the mutagenic activity of NBP in TA98NR in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the cytosol-mediated activity was also inhibited by allopurinol, implying that the cytosolic enzyme activity might be due to xanthine oxidase. In vitro enzymatic reduction of NBP using bacterial cell lysates of TA98 and TA98NR revealed the major product of reduction to be 4-aminobiphenyl. The transient intermediates of reduction were not detected during the in vitro incubation. The reduction intermediate N-hydroxylaminobiphenyl showed direct and equal mutagenic activity in both TA98 and TA98NR, in contrast to NBP. These results suggest that N-hydroxylaminobiphenyl is generated during the preincubation of NBP with xanthine oxidase or cytosolic preparations and the former might account for the mutagenicity of NBP. Furthermore, the occurrence of such enzyme(s) in the target tissue for NBP carcinogenesis, support the hypothesis that metabolic activation of the bladder carcinogen NBP could occur within the target organ by virtue of its intrinsic metabolic potential.",Is Allopurinol mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False

(Boraginaceae) is a highly valuable medicinal herb that is used for the treatment of fever, bronchitis, asthma, rheumatism, stomach irritation, and other inflammatory disorders. The present study aims to explore the hepatoprotective potential of ethanolic extract ( Obeth ) from  O. bracteata  aerial parts against carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ) which causes hepatic damage in the male Wistar rats.  Obeth  showed effective radical quenching activity with an EC 50  of 115.14 and 199.33 µg/mL in superoxide radical scavenging and lipid peroxidation analyses respectively along with plasmid DNA protective potential in plasmid nicking assay. The  Obeth  modulated mutagenicity of 2 Aminofluorine (2AF) in the pre-incubation mode of investigation (EC 50  10.48 µg/0.1 mL/plate) in TA100 strain of  Salmonella typhimurium . In  in vivo  studies, pretreatment of  Obeth  (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) had the potential to normalize the biochemical markers aggravated by CCl 4  (1mL/kg b.wt.) including liver antioxidative enzymes. Histopathological analysis also revealed the restoration of CCl 4 -induced liver histopathological alterations. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the treatment of  Obeth  downregulated the expression levels of p53 and cyclin D in hepatocytes. and downregulation in the Western blotting analysis revealed the downregulation of p-NF-kB, COX-2, and p53. HPLC data analysis showed the supremacy of major compounds namely, catechin, kaempferol, epicatechin, and Onosmin A in  Obeth . The present investigation establishes the hepatoprotective and chemopreventive potential of  O. bracteata  against CCl 4 -induced hepatotoxicity  via  antioxidant defense system and modulation of the expression of proteins associated with the process of carcinogenesis in hepatic cells.",Is Obeth mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
1201,"India is one of the 12 mega diversity countries in the world so it has a vital stake in conservation and sustainable utilization of its biodiversity resources. Plant secondary metabolites have been of interest to man for a long time due to their pharmacological relevance. With this in view, the bark powder of Acacia auriculiformis, A. nilotica, Juglans regia, and the fruit powder of Terminalia bellerica, T. chebula, Emblica officinalis, and a combination drug ""Triphala,"" which are known to be rich in polyphenols, were tested for their antimutagenic activities. Antimutagenic activities of the extracts were estimated by employing the plate incorporation Ames Salmonella histidine reversion assay by using the frame shift mutagen tester strain TA98 and base pair substitution strain TA100 against direct acting mutagens (NPD, sodium azide), and the S9-dependent mutagen 2-aminofluorene(2AF). Acetone extracts of all the plants exhibited significant antimutagenic activities among the other extracts tested, but an acetone extract of Acacia nilotica showed a marked anti-mutagent effect. Furthermore, it was more effective against indirect acting mutagen, 2AF, in both TA98 and TA100 tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium than against the direct acting mutagens. The results indicate that an acetone extract of bark and fruit of the medicinal plants under study harbors constituents with promising antimutagenic/anticarcinogenic potential that could be investigated further.",Is Triphala mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1202,"We determined the antimutagenicity of phenolic fractions of Terminalia arjuna (soluble and insoluble in chloroform) against two direct-acting mutagens, 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD) and sodium azide, and against the S9-dependent mutagen 2-aminofluorene (2AF), in TA98 and TA100 tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium. We found that the phenolic fractions of T. arjuna inhibited revertants induced by the S9-dependent mutagen more remarkably than the direct-acting mutagens. Furthermore, the phenolic fractions showed maximum inhibition of 98% and 101.55%, respectively, in the pre-incubation mode of treatment against the mutations induced by 2AF. Overall, the fractions inhibited the revertants induced by S9-dependent mutagens more effectively than those induced by direct-acting mutagens. The percentage of inhibition was higher in the pre-incubation than with direct acting mutagens. The fraction insoluble in chloroform showed more inhibition than the soluble one, which corresponds to a higher polyphenol content in the insoluble fraction than in the soluble extract.",Is 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1203,"A study to evaluate an antimutagenic potential of water, chloroform and acetone extracts of Triphala has been made in an Ames histidine reversion assay using TA98 and TA100 tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium against the direct-acting mutagens, 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD) and sodium azide, and the indirect-acting promutagen, 2-aminofluorene (2AF), in the presence of phenobarbitone-induced rat hepatic S9. A combination drug 'Triphala' - a composite mixture of Terminalia bellerica, T. chebula and Emblica officinalis, has been used in traditional system of medicine for the treatment of many malaises, such as heart ailments and hepatic diseases. The drug was sequentially extracted with water, acetone and chloroform at room temperature. The study revealed that water extract was ineffective in reducing the revertants induced by the mutagens. The results with chloroform and acetone extracts showed inhibition of mutagenicity induced by both direct and S9-dependent mutagens. A significant inhibition of 98.7% was observed with acetone extract against the revertants induced by S9-dependent mutagen, 2AF, in co-incubation mode of treatment. Various spectroscopic techniques, namely 1H-NMR, normal 13C-NMR, distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT-90 and DEPT-135), UV and IR, are under way to identify the polyphenolic compounds from an acetone extract.",Is NPD mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1204,"The present study provides a correlation of the antimutagenic and chemopreventive activity of the barks of two commonly observed plants viz. Acacia auriculiformis and Acacia nilotica. We used the Ames antimutagenicity assay and the mouse mammary gland organ culture (MMOC) model. The plants were extracted with organic solvents to obtain chloroform fractions and acetone extracts. The antimutagenic activity was determined in two different strains using both direct-acting [4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD) or sodium azide] and indirect-acting [2-aminofluorene (2AF)] mutagens. The anticarcinogenic activity was evaluated based on the development of preneoplastic lesions in response to the chemical carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). The results showed that the activity resulting from the 2AF mutagen was selectively greater than the activity from the direct-acting mutagens. Moreover, in general, acetone extracts were more potent in suppressing mutagenesis than the chloroform extracts. The antimutagenicity results obtained with extracts using the 2AF--TA100 system were comparable to the chemopreventive results with DMBA-induced mammary lesions. The order of activity in both tests was A. nilotica > A. auriculiformis. These results exhibited a good correlation between the antimutagenesis assay and the MMOC model, suggesting that these plants may contain active chemopreventive agents.",Is auriculiformis mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
1205,"Terminalia arjuna is an important medicinal plants widely used in the preparation of Ayurvedic formulations used against several ailments. The present investigation was aimed at the fractionation of crude extracts from the bark of T. arjuna in order to isolate and purify the antimutagenic factors present. The antimutagenicity assay was performed to check the modulatory effect of these fractions against NPD, sodium azide, and 2AF, using the Ames Salmonella his+ reversion assay. Most of the phenolic fractions exhibited mutagen specificity against direct-acting mutagens, being effective in suppressing the frameshift mutagen NPD but failing to inhibit sodium azide (base pair substitution)-induced his+ revertants. ET-1 fraction triterpenoid diglycoside showed a marked effect against sodium azide but was ineffective against NPD. In the case of the indirect-acting mutagen 2AF, all the fractions were found to be quite potent in modulating its mutagenicity in both TA98 and TA100 tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium. The results indicate that the bark of T. arjuna harbors constituents with promising antimutagenic/anticarcinogenic potential that should be investigated further.",Is T. arjuna mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1206,"A fraction isolated from Terminalia arjuna was studied for its antimutagenic effect against 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD) in TA98, sodium azide in TA100 and 2-aminofluorene (2AF, S9-dependent), a promutagen, in both TA98 and TA 100 tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium using the Ames assay. The fraction inhibited the mutagenicity of 2AF very significantly in both strains while the revertant colonies induced by NPD and sodium azide were reduced moderately. 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, IR and UV-spectroscopic data of the fraction revealed it to be tannin in nature.",Is 2AF mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1207,"The mutagenic and antimutagenic activities of forty-two synthetic flavones were assessed by the Ames test. The tested flavones included twenty-three 3-nitroflavones, eighteen 3-aminoflavones and the 3-chloroflavone. The mutagenicity was evaluated with Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and YG1042 (an overproducing nitroreductase and O-acetyltransferase TA100 strain) with and without metabolic activation (S9 mix). The antimutagenicity of the non mutagenic derivatives was evaluated against 11 known reference mutagens. A total of 39 synthetic flavones were mutagenic. The mutagenic activities ranged from 0.1 rev/nmole (4'-chloro-6-methoxy-3-nitroflavone) to 6240 rev/nmole (4'-methoxy-3, 3'-diaminoflavone). Two differences were found between the 3-amino and the 3-nitroflavones: (i) the mutagenicity of the 3-aminoflavones required the presence of the metabolic activation; (ii) the 3-amino derivatives were more mutagenic than their 3-nitro counterparts. Increased mutagenicity, as assessed with strain YG1042, was limited to 17/39 derivatives. The mutagenic activity was induced by the presence of the double bond at the 2,3-position for conjugation of the lone-pair electron with the carbonyl group on the 'C' ring. This mutagenicity was modulated by substituents at the 2'-position. Additional mutagenicity was brought by the aminoaromatic and nitroaromatic group reduction by bacterial nitroreductases and by the S9 mix; it was modulated by different substituents on the aromatic rings of the flavones. Three flavones: 3-chloroflavone (1C), 4'-hydroxy-3-nitroflavone (23N) and 2',3-diaminoflavone (2A) showed antimutagenic properties. Compound 1C was efficient against benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), 2-aminofluorene (2AF), 2-aminoanthracene (2AA), 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) and 1-methyl-3'-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Compound 23N inhibited the mutagenicity of BaP and MNNG. The antimutagenic activity of 2A was limited to MNNG.",Is 3-aminoflavones mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1208,"The ability of human red blood cell cytosol to activate aromatic amines was evaluated with the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the liquid preincubation condition. While negative results were obtained with 4-acetylaminofluorene (4AAF) and 1-naphtylamine (1NA), a slight response was observed for 4-aminobiphenyl (4ABP) and 2-naphthylamine (2NA). Human red blood cell cytosol was able to activate 2-aminofluorene (2AF), 2-acetylaminofluorene (2AAF) and 2-aminoanthracene (2AA) to mutagenic intermediates. Extracts of human red blood cell cytosol incubated with 2AF were analyzed by gas chromatography: N-hydroxy-2-aminofluorene was identified as a metabolite.",Is 2AF mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1209,"Mutagenic activity of the promutagens 2-aminofluorene (2AF) and a contaminant of 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NOP-X) was followed in Ames Salmonella strain TA98 following metabolism by cotton and carrot cell suspension cultures using the plant cell/microbe coincubation assay. Both cell lines were capable of activating each chemical. However, activation capacities of the cell lines differed relative to their respective stage of growth when used. For 2AF activation early-log phase cotton cells and mid-log phase carrot cells proved superior while mid-log phase cotton cells and stationary phase carrot cells proved superior for NOP-X activation. These data indicate that the phase of the growth cycle at which plant cells are harvested can significantly affect their promutagen activation potential.",Is NOP-X mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1210,"The S9 phenobarbital-induced preparations from Albino rats and 6 strains of inbred and outbred Pzh: SFISS mice were tested by an Ames test for their ability to metabolize the two promutagens 2-aminofluorene (2AF) and cyclophosphamide (CP), and to influence the mutagenic activity of the two directly acting mutagens methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). 2AF showed a mutagenic activity after incubation with all kinds of microsomal preparations. S9 from B10. mice (Ah+Ah+) was twice as active as that from D2.BN mice (Ah- Ah-). CP was mutagenic exclusively in the presence of S9 from Pzh: SFISS or B10. mice and from rats. Neither fraction deactivated significantly the mutagenicity of MMS. Microsomal preparations from Albino rats and outbred mice were most active in deactivating the mutagenicity of MNNG.",Is CP mutagenic for nan strain?,True
1211,"The three trimethyl isomers of benzene (hemimellitene, 1,2,3-TMB; pseudocumene, 1,2,4-TMB and mesitylene, 1,3,5-TMB) were investigated for different genotoxicity endpoints: in vitro, in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA97a, TA98, TA100 and TA102 strains in the presence and absence of rat liver S9 metabolic activation; in vivo, in the micronucleus and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) tests with bone marrow cells of Imp:Balb/c mice. Only the isomer of benzene with the methyl-group at position 1, 2, 3 was found to have mutagenic effect on S. typhimurium cells. Increase in bacterial reversions was observed in four conventional strains used in this study, but most clearly in TA97a. The mutagenic responses of 1,2,3-TMB with the SalmonellaL tester strains were observed in the experiments performed in the absence of enzymatic activation. None of the compounds had an influence on the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in bone marrow cells of mice. However, all the three compounds were observed to have a cytogenetic potential of increasing the SCE level in these cells. Significant responses in SCE induction, compared with the level of those changes in corresponding solvent-administered controls, were obtained at three test doses of 1,2,3-TMB (730, 1470, 2200 mg/kg) and 1,2,4-TMB (900, 1800, 2700 mg/kg) and at two doses of 1,3,5-TMB (1800, 2700 mg/kg). These data provided a limited evidence for the genotoxic activity of 1,2,3-TMB and inadequate evidence for genotoxic activity of 1,2,4-TMB and 1,3,5-TMB.","Is 1,2,3-TMB mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?",True
1212,"Benzidine and several derivatives are activated to mutagenic species in an H2O2-dependent Ames test system. Optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy are employed in studies of the H2O2-dependent oxidation of benzidine and 3,5,3',5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) catalyzed by intact bacteria, and provide direct evidence for peroxidase activity in Salmonella typhimurium. The acetylase-proficient Ames tester strain TA98 and its acetylase-deficient derivative TA98/1,8-DNP6 are equally responsive to H2O2-dependent mutagenicity; enzymatic acetylation appears not to be involved in activation of benzidine, in this system. The H2O2-dependent mutagenicity of benzidine and oxidation of TMB are observed when the assays are carried out in acetate buffer (pH 5.5), but not in 2-[N-morpholino]ethane sulfonic acid (MES) buffer, at the same pH. This difference is interpreted in terms of the effects of these buffers on the intracellular pH of the bacteria. The H2O2-dependent mutagenicity of several benzidine congeners is also described.",Is Benzidine mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1213,"A novel pathway of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism involves the oxidation of non-K-region trans-dihydrodiols to yield o-quinones, a reaction catalyzed by dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DD). We have recently shown that in isolated rat hepatocytes (+/-)-trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo-[a] pyrene (BP-diol) was oxidized by this route to yield benzo [a] pyrene-7,8-dione (BPQ). We now report the disposition of BPQ and its mutagenic and genotoxic properties. Using [3H]BPQ it was found that 30% of the radioactivity was sequestered by rat hepatocytes into the cell pellet. Isolation of hepatocyte DNA provided evidence for a low level of covalent incorporation of BPQ into DNA (30 +/- 17 adducts/ 10(6) base pairs). Examination of the hepatocellular DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis following treatment with BPQ indicated that extensive fragmentation had occurred. DNA fragmentation was also observed when hepatocytes were treated with BP-diol and this effect was attenuated by indomethacin, a DD inhibitor. Hepatocytes treated with either BP-diol or BPQ were found to produce large quantities of superoxide anion radical (O2.-). The amount of O2.- generated by BP-diol was blocked by DD inhibitors. These data suggest that by diverting BP-diol to BPQ reactive oxygen species (ROS) were generated which caused DNA fragmentation. The ability of BPQ to cause DNA strand scission was further studied using supercoiled phi X174 DNA. It was found that BPQ caused concentration-dependent (0.05-10 microM) strand scission in the presence of 1 mM NADPH (which promoted redox-cycling) provided CuCl2 (10 microM) was present. Complete destruction of the DNA was observed using 10 microM BPQ. This strand scission was prevented by catalase and hydroxyl radical scavengers but not by superoxide dismutase. These data indicate that ROS were responsible for the destruction of the DNA. Using 20 microM (+/-)-anti-7,8-dihydroxy-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo [a]pyrene [(+/-)-anti-BPDE] only single nicks in the DNA were observed indicating that BPQ was the more potent chemical nuclease. BPQ was also found to be a direct-acting mutagen in the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102, and TA104, but was 10-5500-fold less efficient as a mutagen than (+/-)-anti-BPDE. Our data indicate that DD suppresses the mutagenicity of (+/-)-anti-BPDE by producing BPQ, but in doing so a potent chemical nuclease is produced which causes extensive DNA fragmentation via the generation of ROS.",Is BPQ mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1214,"Eight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) ortho-quinones that can be generated by dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DD) were examined for their cytotoxicity in H-4-II-e (rat hepatoma) cells and for their mutagenicity in the Ames test. Seven of the PAH otrtho-quinones were potent cytotoxins yielding IC50 values for cell survival in the range 1-30 microns. PAH ortho-quinones were grouped into three classes based on their cytotoxicity profiles: group I contained ortho-quinones (e.g., naphthalene-1,2-dione and 7,12-dimethylbenz[alpha]anthracene-3,4-dione) which reduced cell viability and cell survival; group II contained ortho-quinones (e.g., benz[alpha]anthracene-3,4-dione and 5-methylchrysene-1,2-dione which reduced cell survival but had no effect on cell viability; and group III contained ortho-quinones (e.g., benzo[alpha]pyrene-7,8-dione) which had a pronounced effect on cell viability but minimal effects on cell survival. Using hepatoma cell suspensions and rat liver subcellular fractions, it was found that ortho-quinones underwent preferential enzymatic one-electron redox-cycling and produced superoxide anion radical (O2-.) and/or ortho-semiquinone anion or alternant radicals. ortho-Quinones that reduced cell viability produced O2-. and caused the most total free radical formation, while those that reduced cell survival produced ortho-semiquinone anion or alternant radicals only. PAH ortho-quinones were also tested as direct-acting mutagens in Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102 and TA104. They were found to be more mutagenic than the test mutagens used for each tester strain, and were predominantly frameshift mutagens. The presence of an activating system (Aroclor-induced rat liver S9 plus NADPH) did not increase the mutagenicity of ortho-quinones in tester strains that are sensitive to oxidative mutagens (TA102 and TA104). These data suggest that PAH ortho-quinones produced by DD are cytotoxic and mutagenic by different mechanisms. The mechanism of cytotoxicity involves the formation of reactive oxygen species and/or ortho-semiquinone anion or alternant radicals. The mechanism of mutagenicity is independent of free radical formation and is related to the ability of PAH orthooffinones to intercalate and covalently modify DNA.",Is DD mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1215,"Improved yields of 5'-nucleotides from yeast extract for food flavouring purposes is possible through use of microbial nucleotidases, which will be available to food processors as the flavour enhancer Aromild. The safety of these enzymes, 5'-phosphodiesterase (RP-1) and the 5'-adenylic deaminase (DN-50000) was investigated in male and female rats. Feeding rats a diet admixed with 500, 2000 and 8000 mg/kg body weight of DN-50000 for 35 days resulted in no significant dose-related changes in body weight, water consumption, urinalysis, haematological profiles, blood chemistry or histopathological profiles of either male or female rats from consumption of the enzyme preparation. There was an increase in the absolute and/or relative organ weights of the submaxillary (salivary) glands in both sexes at 8000 mg/kg. The no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for DN-50000 was clearly evident at 2000 mg/kg. Consumption of RP-1 enzyme for 35 days at dietary levels of 500, 2000 and 8000 mg/kg body weight resulted in no significant changes in the above mentioned parameters, which could be directly attributed to a dose-related effect, with the exception of an increase in the absolute and relative weights of submaxillary glands of both male and female rats in the 2000 and 8000 mg/kg groups. The increase in weight of the submaxillary glands was associated with histological evidence of acinar cell hypertrophy. The NOEL for dietary consumption of RP-1 was clearly evident at 500 mg/kg. In a follow-up study in which rats were gavaged with 2000 mg/kg RP-1, submaxillary gland hypertrophy did not occur. These studies suggest that DN-50000 and RP-1 exert an action on submaxillary glands similar to that which has been previously reported for the enzyme pancreatin. Neither DN-50000 nor RP-1 were mutagenic in the Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA98, TA1537 or Escherichia coli strain WP2uvrA, in the presence or absence of S9 mix.",Is DN-50000 mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or WP2uvrA or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False

Nitronates of the secondary nitroalkanes 2-nitropropane, 2-nitrobutane, 3-nitropentane, and nitrocyclopentane were significantly mutagenic in Salmonella strains TA100 and TA102 at 10-80 mumoles/plate, but the parent compounds were mutagenic at only a single dose level or were not mutagenic at all in the same dose range. The primary nitroalkanes and the nitrocarbinols were not mutagenic, or only marginally so, at the concentrations tested. The nitronates of the primary nitroalkanes and the nitrocarbinols reprotonated too rapidly under the conditions of the assay for adequate evaluation of mutagenicity. 2-Methyl-2-nitropropane was not mutagenic in strains TA100 and TA102; 2-nitroso-2-nitropropane was also not mutagenic in strains TA100 and TA102, but induced an equivocal mutagenic response in TA98. The positive Salmonella mutation data for the nitronates of the secondary nitroalkanes studied correlate very well with the very slow rate of reprotonation of secondary nitroalkane nitronates at pH 7.7 (Conaway et al. (1991) Cancer Res., 51, 3143), and provide further evidence that nitronates of secondary nitroalkanes, rather than the neutral parent forms with which they may be in equilibrium, are the more proximate mutagenic species.",Is 2-nitroso-2-nitropropane mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1217,"Mutagenicity of 102 aliphatic and aromatic nitro compounds, industrial materials and related chemicals were tested by pre-incubation method using Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98 strains with and without S9 mix. Escherichia coli WP2uvrA/pKM101 was also used in the mutagenicity assay of aliphatic nitro compounds. Four chemicals out of 8 aliphatic nitro compounds tested were mutagenic to TA100, TA98 and/or WP2 strains. Sixty-one out of 94 nitrobenzene derivatives were mutagenic to TA100 and/or TA98 strains. Thirty-seven chemicals among the 65 mutagens showed higher mutagenic activity than 1,000 rev./mg. The following 15 chemicals showed higher activity than 10,000 rev./mg: tetranitromethane, chloropicrin, 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene, 2,3-dinitrophenol, 2,6-dinitroaniline, 3,5-dinitroaniline, 2-bromo-4,6-dinitroaniline, 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene, p-nitrobenzylchloride, 3,5-dinitrobenzylchloride, p-nitrophenylhydrazine, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, 2,4-dinitrophenylthiocyanate and nitramine.

Introduction of-Cl, -CH3, -C2H5 or -SO3H group to nitrobenzene did not contribute to mutagenicity. Mutagenicity of dinitrobenzene was enhanced by the introduction of -F, -SCN, -NH2, -Cl, -CH2Cl, -NO2, -NH-NH2 or -COCl group, and suppressed by the introduction of -COOH or -CH3 group. Twenty-three out of 45 chemicals for which ""exposure limits"" are established from the stand point of industrial hygiene in many countries in the world, were mutagenic to TA100, TA98 and/or WP2 strains.

1218,"Three nitroparaffins (nitroethane, 1-nitropropane, and 2-nitropropane) were studied in the Salmonella typhimurium/mammalian microsome (Ames) test, with and without microsomal activation systems. Nitroethane and 2-nitropropane also were studied in an in vivo mutagenic (micronucleus) test. These studies were undertaken because these solvents are widely used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries and 2-nitropropane was reported to cause liver cancer in rats exposed by the inhalation route. Neither nitroethane nor 1-nitropropane was active in the Ames test with Salmonella tester-strains TA1537, TA92, TA98, or TA100. However, 2-nitropropane produced a significant increase in revertants in all of these tester strains, particularly strain TA100, where 3 microliter/plate doubled the number of revertants in the presence of microsomal enzymes. Negative results were obtained with both nitroethane and 2-nitropropane in micronucleus tests. These studies have shown that 2-nitropropane has the potential for causing point mutations in a microbial test system.

(i) Carcinogenic potential of dipyrone A for rat liver: 8 week old male F344 rats were pretreated with 0.01% diethylnitrosamine (DEN) in drinking water for 2 weeks and, after 1 week of resting, administered 0.4% dipyrone in drinking water, 5 days a week, for 72 weeks. After an 8 week recovery period, all surviving rats were killed at 83 weeks. Hepatocellular carcinomas developed at a higher incidence in the DEN + dipyrone group (18 of 29 rats, 62%) than in the DEN alone group (9 of 29 rats, 31%), the difference being statistically significant (P less than 0.05). No carcinogenic activity of dipyrone was demonstrated in the groups given 0.4% dipyrone for 72 weeks or 0.4% dipyrone for 25 weeks, followed by 0.05% phenobarbital (PB) for 50 weeks.

Two main modifications were evaluated. Since the metabolism of dialkylnitrosamines is postulated to be mainly dependent on cytochrome P4502E1, a pyrazole-induced rat liver S9 was applied. The second modification involved a gastight preincubation, since metabolites of NDEA might evaporate from the incubation mixture. Cytochrome P4502E1 induction in Wistar rats was achieved by pyrazole treatment. For comparison, a rat liver S9-fraction produced by beta-naphtoflavone/phenobarbital induction was used. N-Nitrosopyrrolidine served as positive control for pyrazole-induced S9-mix with TA1535. NDEA showed no mutagenic response under all test conditions in the presence of pyrazole-induced S9-mix. A strong mutagenic response, exceeding the base rate up to 15-fold at a dose range of 25-1000 microg/plate, was observed using beta-naphtoflavone/phenobarbital-induced S9-mix, gastight preincubation and TA1535. In conclusion the Ames test with gastight preincubation can be useful for the testing of volatile compounds or substances leading to gaseous metabolites. The weak response of NDEA in the Ames test observed previously seems mainly to be due to the volatile character of its mutagenic metabolites. Our results do not support the hypothesis that cytochrome P4502E1 is a major toxifying enzyme for the formation of Ames-test-positive metabolites from NDEA.",Is N-Nitrosodiethylamine mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
1221,"Development of mutagenicity of five N-nitrosamines (N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine (NDPA), N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) and N-nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPhA)) was investigated during oxidative processes involving UV-photolysis, ozone and OH radicals. The mutagenicity was detected by the Ames test with 3 different strains, TA98, TAMix and YG7108, a strain which is sensitive for N-nitrosamines, in presence and absence of metabolic activation (S9). UV photolysis of mutagenic N-nitrosamines (NDMA, NDEA, NDPA and NPYR) leads to the removal of their specific mutagenic activity as detected in YG7108 in the presence of S9. A formation of mutagens during UV photolysis was detected only in case of NDPhA in the strain TA98. Oxidation products of NDMA, NDEA and NDPhA did not show any significant mutagenicity in the strains used, whereas oxidation of NDPA and NPYR by hydroxyl radicals seems to lead to the formation of direct mutagens (mutagenic in the absence of S9) in YG7108 and TAMix. Oxidation by hydroxyl radicals of N-nitrosamines with chains longer than ethyl can mimic metabolic activation of N-nitrosamines in vivo. ",Is NDEA mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1222,"We investigated the photo-mutagenicity and photo-genotoxicity of N-dialkylnitrosamines and its mechanisms of UVA activation. With simultaneous irradiation of UVA, photo-mutagenicity of seven N-dialkylnitrosamines was observed in Ames bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium TA1535) in the absence of metabolic activation. Mutagenicity of pre-irradiated N-dialkylnitrosamines was also observed with S. typhimurium hisG46, TA100, TA102 and YG7108 in the absence of metabolic activation. UVA-mediated mutation with N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) decreased by adding either the NO or OH radical scavenger. When superhelical DNA was irradiated with N-dialkylnitrosamines, nicked circular DNA appeared. Ten N-dialkylnitrosamines examined produced strand breaks in the treated DNA in the presence of UVA. The level of single-strand breaks in phiX174 DNA mediated by N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) and UVA decreased by adding either a radical scavenger or superoxide dismutase. When calf thymus DNA was treated with N-dialkylnitrosamines (NDMA, NDEA, NMOR, N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) and N-nitrosopiperidine (NPIP)) and UVA, the ratio of 8-oxodG/dG in the DNA increased. Action spectra were obtained to determine if nitrosamine acts as a sensitizer of UVA. Both mutation frequency and NO formation were highest at the absorption maximum of nitrosamines, approximately 340 nm. The plots of NO formation and mutation frequency align with the absorption curve of NPYR, NMOR and NDMA. A significant linear correlation between the optical density of N-dialkynitrosamines at 340 nm and NO formation in each irradiated solution was revealed by ANOVA. We would like to propose the hypothesis that the N-nitroso moiety of N-dialkylnitrosamines absorbs UVA photons, UVA-photolysis of N-dialkylnitrosamines brings release of nitric oxide, and subsequent production of alkyl radical cations and active oxygen species follow as secondary events, which cause DNA strand breaks, oxidative and alkylative DNA damages and mutation.",Is N-dialkylnitrosamines mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 strain?,True
1223,"Chemoprevention is an important alternative approach to control cancer. Chemical substances with multiple inhibitory properties would be a welcome addition to the class of chemopreventive drugs. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic and cancer preventive activities of aqueous extract of a macrofungus Phellinus rimosus (Berk) Pilat. The extract exhibited superoxide anion (O2-), hydroxyl radical (*OH), nitric oxide (NO*) scavenging and lipid peroxidation inhibiting activities. The inhibitory concentrations required by the extract to scavenge 50% (IC50) of the superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical and nitric oxide generated were 126 +/- 5.1, 71 +/- 4.7 and 31 +/- 4.5 microg/ml respectively. The concentration required to inhibit 50% of Fe2+ induced lipid peroxidation in rat liver homogenate was 318 +/- 2.4 microg/ml. The extract showed significant (P<0.05) anti-inflammatory activity in a dose dependent manner. Extract (100 mg/kg body wt, p.o) inhibited 44.5, 45.4 and 47% carrageenen, dextran and formalin induced inflammations respectively. The antimutagenic activity was determined by the Ames' Salmonella mutagenecity assay using histidine mutant Salmonella typhimurium strains. The extract at concentration of 5 mg/plate showed antimutagenecity against benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and 4-nitro-o-pheneylenediamine (NPDA) induced mutations of TA98 and TA100 respectively. Anticarcinogenic activity was evaluated using N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in rats. Serum gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities and lipid peroxidation level (MDA) were elevated significantly (P<0.05) in the NDEA alone treated group of animals. Treatment of the extract (25 and 50 mg/kg body wt, p.o.) prior to the NDEA administration decreased the serum GGT, GOT, GPT and ALP activities and MDA level in a dose dependent manner. The NDEA alone treated animals showed altered serum albumin/globulin ratio (A:G ratio), hyperfibrinogenaemia, increased hepatic glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, glutathione-peroxidsae (GPx) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) level compared to the extract plus NDEA treated group. The extract also inhibited in vitro aniline hydroxylase (AH) activity of rat liver induced by phenobarbitone in a dose dependent manner. The results, thus suggest the significant chemopreventive properties of the aqueous extract of the Phellinus rimosus against NDEA induced hepatocellular carcinoma by its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimutagenic activities.",Is Phellinus rimosus mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1224,"N-Nitroso compounds, such as N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), are a versatile group of chemical carcinogens, being suspected to be involved in gastrointestinal tumors in humans. The intestinal microflora can modify a wide range of environmental chemicals either directly or in the course of enterohepatic circulation. Nitroreductases from bacteria seem to have a wide spectrum of substrates, as observed by the reduction of several nitroaromatic compounds, but their capacity to metabolize N-nitroso compounds has not been described. To elucidate the participation of nitroreductase or acetyltransferase enzymes in the mutagenic activity of NDEA, the bacterial (reverse) mutation test was carried out with the strains YG1021 (nitroreductase overexpression), YG1024 (acetyltransferase overexpression), TA98NR (nitroreductase deficient), and TA98DNP6 (acetyltrasferase deficient), and YG1041, which overexpresses both enzymes. The presence of high levels of acetyltransferase may generate toxic compounds that must be eliminated by cellular processes or can lead to cell death, and consequently decrease the mutagenic effect, as can be observed by the comparison of strain TA98DNP6 with the strains TA98 and YG1024. The slope curves for TA98 strain were 0.66 rev/microM (R(2) = 0.51) and 52.8 rev/microM (R(2) = 0.88), in the absence and presence of S9 mix, respectively. For YG1024 strain, the slope curve, in the presence of S9 mix was 6897 rev/microM (R(2) = 0.78). Our data suggest that N-nitroso compounds need to be initially metabolized by enzymes such as cytochromes P450 to induce mutagenicity. Nitroreductase stimulates toxicity, while acetyltransferase stimulates mutagenicity, and nitroreductase can neutralize the mechanism of mutagenicity generating innoccuos compounds, probably by acting on the product generated after NDEA activation.",Is NDEA mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

1226,"In a previous report we described the ability of cyclohexanol to induce CYP activity. In order to characterize this induction we tested the capacity of liver S9 from rats orally treated with cyclohexanol for 5 days, to activate several carcinogenic nitrosamines into mutagens in the Salmonella typhimurium TA100 test system. Additionally, Western blot analysis of hepatic microsomes from the same treated animals were analysed with specific antibodies against P450 protein families 1A1/A2, 2B1/B2 and 2E1. Cyclohexanol-S9 mixture was more efficient in activating the following nitrosamines: N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodipropylamine (NDPA), N-nitrosomethylpropylamine (NMPA), N-nitrosodibutylamine (NDBA), and N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) into bacterial mutagens than S9 from non-treated animals. The mutagenicity of N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) was not modified in the presence of S9 from cyclohexanol-treated animals. Since the main metabolic pathway leading to the production of mutagenic intermediates of NDMA and NPYR is catalysed by isozyme CYP2E1 and that of NDPA, NMPA and NDBA by CYP2B1/B2, mutagenicity experiments predicted that cyclohexanol induces these two P450 isozyme families. Western blot analysis confirmed the results of the mutagenicity assay, showing an increase in the intensity of CYP2E1 and CYP2B1/B2 protein bands in hepatic microsomes from cyclohexanol treated rats in comparison with non-treated controls. Bacterial mutagenicity tests with specific pro-mutagens were good predictors of the P450 induction properties of cyclohexanol.",Is NDEA mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1227,"CC-1065, a very potent antitumor antibiotic, is active against several animal tumors, and against human tumors in the cloning assay at doses 50-1000 times lower than other agents such as adriamycin. It binds and alkylates DNA, and inhibits DNA synthesis, suggesting a potential for genotoxicity. Therefore, the genotoxic effects of CC-1065 were tested in several assay systems. CC-1065 was weakly mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella mutation assay (strain TA100) without S9 activation, but lacked mutagenic activity in TA98 with or without activation. CC-1065 was a very potent mutagen in the Salmonella forward mutation assay (induction of 8-azaguanine resistance), increasing the mutation frequency 19-fold over background at 0.1 ng/ml without activation. In mammalian (V79) cells it was a very potent mutagen without activation, increasing the mutation frequency 20-fold over background a 0.5 ng/ml. CC-1065 induced chromosome aberrations in V79 cells at very low (less than 0.1 ng/ml) doses, making this assay the most sensitive. CC-1065 increased the induction of micronuclei in rats 10- to 20-fold over the background at 200 and 400 micrograms/kg, but not at 100 micrograms/kg.

It is known that hydrochlorothiazide purity is a challenging problem for the pharmaceutical industry. As there were no prior mutagenicity data for the impurity salamide, the aim was to investigate its mutagenicity in this study. Salamide was tested for mutagenic potential in Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and E. coli WP2 uvrA + E. coli WP2 [pKM101] strains at six different concentrations, the highest concentration being the 5000 μg/plate.

Evidence of mutagenic activity was seen at non-toxic dosing levels in S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 and E. coli strain WP2 uvrA. Responses in TA98 and E. coli were marginal at best, but a firm positive mutagenic activity was noted in TA100 at 20 micrograms per plate without S-9 activation and at 67 micrograms per plate with S-9 activation.

1231,"Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is currently being considered as an alternate to chlorine as a disinfectant for water treatment. Many organic compounds present in water and food treated with ClO2 are subject to oxidation. 21 amino acids and 3 peptides (L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester (aspartame), L-glycyl-L-tryptophan and L-tryptophylglycine) were studied for their reactivity with ClO2. Chlorine dioxide reacted only with 6 amino acids in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. The reaction with cysteine, tryptophan and tyrosine was too rapid to be monitored either iodometrically or spectrophotometrically. The reaction with histidine, hydroxyproline and proline was found to be pseudo-first order. ClO2 readily reacted with L-glycyl-L-tryptophan and L-tryptophylglycine but not with aspartame. Mutagenicity studies with the Salmonella microsome assay of the reaction mixtures of ClO2 with those 6 reactive amino acids and the 3 peptides indicated that the reaction products of the 3 peptides, hydroxyproline, and tyrosine exerted mutagenic activity toward both tester strains of TA98 and TA100 in the presence and absence of rat-liver S9 mix.",Is hydroxyproline mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

Here, we investigated the genotoxicity potential of  D. Rhizome  water extract (DRWE) using three standard battery systems in accordance with the test guidelines of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and Ministry of Food and Drug Safety as well as the principles of Good Laboratory Practice. A bacterial reverse mutation test (Ames test) was performed using the direct plate incorporation method in the presence or absence of a metabolic activation system (S9 mixture). The tester strains used included four histidine auxotrophic strains of  Salmonella typhimurium , TA100, TA1535, TA98, and TA1537, along with a tryptophan auxotrophic strain of  Escherichia coli , WP2  uvr A. An in vitro chromosome aberration test was performed using CHL/IU cells originally derived from the lung of a female Chinese hamster in the presence or absence of the S9 mixture. An in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test was performed using male ICR mice. The micronucleus was confirmed after observation of the micro-nucleated polychromatic. The Ames test showed that DRWE did not induce gene mutations at any dose level in any of the tested strains. Additionally, DRWE did not result in any chromosomal aberrations specified in the in vitro chromosomal aberration and in vivo micronucleus tests.

ATEC is used as plasticizers in cosmetics and nail products. Here, we studied whether ATEC might have genotoxic potential and induce glucose tolerance as compared to DEHP. Genotoxicity was determined by Ames test with histidine-requiring Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537) and tryptophan-requiring Escherichia coli (WP2uvrA(pKM101)) strains, chromosomal aberration assay with Chinese hamster lung(CHL/IU) cells, and micronucleus test with bone marrow cells of CD-1 mice. The number of revertants was not significantly changed in Ames test. The frequency of cells with chromosome aberrations was less than 5% in ATEC- or DEHP-treated cells for 6 or 24 h. In addition, no statistically significant increase was observed for the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE) in polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) and for the ratio of PCE among total erythrocytes at 24 or 48 h after the treatment of mice with ATEC or DEHP. In the meanwhile, blood glucose level (BGL) was increased by the treatment of mice with DEHP or ATEC for 5 consecutive days. Additional 7 days later, BGL by DEHP was recovered to normal level, but not that by ATEC. Then, taken together, our results suggest that ATEC could disrupt glucose metabolism under our experimental conditions. Therefore, although DEHP and ATEC may not be genotoxic, our data should be helpful for persons with the problem in glucose metabolism to choose products containing DEHP or ATEC.",Is ATEC mutagenic for pKM101 or TA100 or TA1535 or WP2uvrA or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
1234,"The purpose of these studies was to examine the potential toxicity and genotoxicity of meso-zeaxanthin (MZ). Toxicity was assessed by administering MZ daily to rats for 13 weeks followed by a 4-week recovery period. Potential genotoxicity was assessed in separate experiments using the Ames test method. Rats were randomly assigned to four groups to receive corn oil (control) or MZ at dose levels of 2, 20 and 200 mg/kg/day by oral gavage (10/sex/group). Additional rats (five of each sex) in the control and the 200 mg/kg/day groups were retained for the recovery period. No compound-related clinical, biochemical or pathological signs or symptoms were noted and the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) of MZ was >200 mg/kg/day. To investigate genotoxicity, MZ was tested for its ability to induce reverse mutations (±microsomal enzymes) at 2 genomic loci; the histidine locus of 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and the tryptophan locus of Escherichia coli strain WP2uvrA. Six doses of MZ ranging from 10 to 5000 μg/plate were tested twice with vehicle and positive controls using 3 plates/dose. MZ did not cause any increase in the mean number of revertants/plate with any bacterial strain, with or without microsomal enzymes, and was therefore unlikely to be mutagenic.",Is MZ mutagenic for WP2uvrA strain?,False
1235,"Several clinical studies have reported that an increase in excretion of tryptophan metabolites 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-OHAA), anthranilic acid (AA) and other metabolites in the urine of bladder cancer patients are implicated to play a role in the etiology of bladder cancer; however the mechanisms involved are unknown. The present study compares the genotoxicity of tryptophan metabolites AA and 3-OHAA to cause mutagenesis in vitro. The DNA damage effects of tryptophan metabolites were analyzed using plasmid relaxation assay performed with AA and 3-OHAA at various concentrations between 50μM and 400μM in the presence of plasmid DNA pSP-72. Both AA and 3-OHAA did not show any plasmid relaxation activity when tested alone. However, 3-OHAA in the presence of metal cofactor Cu (II) induced plasmid relaxation by causing nicks in the plasmid. This effect was not observed in the presence of other metal cofactors Fe (II) and Mn (III). Cu (II) at increasing concentrations between 5μM and 20μM and in the presence of 100μM 3-OHAA showed an apparent dose-response in causing DNA strand breaks. The Cu (II) mediated mutagenic activation of 3-OHAA was further investigated using Ames Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay with reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive tester strain Salmonella TA102. When 100μg of 3-OHAA per plate was incubated with Cu (II) a significant increase in TA102 revertants was observed with an increase in the concentration of Cu (II) from 2.5μg to 50μg. In contrast, AA with Cu (II) at such low concentration was unable to cause any significant increase in number of the TA102 revertants. This evidence for mutagenicity with only 3-OHAA and Cu (II) but not AA suggests the presence of hydroxyl group at ortho position to amino group in 3-OHAA structurally, is critical in reacting with Cu (II) to generate genotoxicity.",Is 3-OHAA mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True

However, there is no sufficient background information on toxicological evaluation of E. splendens extracts to give an assurance of safety for developing dietary supplements and functional foods. The objective of this study was to evaluate safety on E. splendens extracts using acute oral toxicity, bacterial reverse mutation, and chromosome aberration test. Total flavonoids within E. splendens were extracted with 80% of methanol by a reflux condenser. Both female and male mice were orally administrated E. splendens extracts at the dose of 0, 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg body weight/day. Mutagenicity of the extracts was evaluated in a bacterial reverse mutation assay using histidine requiring Salmonella typhimurium (TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, and TA 1537) and tryptophan-requiring Escherichia coli (WP2uvrA). In vitro chromosome aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Lung (CHL) was conducted to evaluate genotoxicity. Single administration of dose levels of 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg body weight/day to mice for 15 days did not produce any significant mortality, clinical signs, body weight loss, and gross findings. E. splendens extracts in the range of 156.3-5000 microg/plate did not induce mutagenicity in S. typhimurium and E. coli with and without metabolic activation system. Any significant chromosomal aberration was not observed in CHL cells 6h after treating with the extract at the concentrations of 1250, 2500, and 5000 microg/mL in absence and presence of metabolic activation system. However, frequency of chromosomal aberration in 22 h after treatment without metabolic activation system was increased with showing a pattern of dose-response relationship. The highest concentration of 5000 microg/mL significantly induced chromosomal aberration. E. splendens extracts may induce chromosomal structure abnormality in CHL cells.

1237,"A continuous hydrogenation device was evaluated for the detoxification of selected tri-, tetra-, or pentacyclic polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds {anthracene, phenanthrene, chrysene, and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P)} by hydrogenation. A substrate stream in hexane, 0.05-1.0% (w/v), was mixed with hydrogen-carbon dioxide (H2-CO2, 5-30% v/v) and delivered to a heated reactor column (25 cm x 1 cm) containing palladium supported on gamma alumina (Pd0/gamma-Al2O3) that was terminated with a capillary restrictor. The flow rate from the reactor, approximately 800 mL min(-1) decompressed gas, corresponded to 4 mL min(-1) fluid under the operating conditions of the trials. Reaction products were recovered by passing the reactor effluent through hexane. At 90 degrees C, the anthracene or phenanthrene substrate was hydrogenated only partially to octahydro and dodecahydro species and contained only a minor quantity of totally hydrogenated products. For substrates with increasing numbers of fused aromatic rings, the hydrogenation efficiency was decreased further. However, at an increasing temperature (90-150 degrees C) and increasing mobile phase flow rate (20.68 MPa corresponding to 2100 mL min(-1) decompressed gas), B[a]P and chrysene were hydrogenated, virtuallytotally, to their corresponding perhydro analogues (eicosahydrobenzo[a]pyrenes and octadecahydrochrysenes), respectively. That this approach might be useful for decontaminating soil extracts was supported by companion in vitro trials in which the substrate and products were assayed for mutagenic activity with five bacterial strains that are auxotrophic for histidine (Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537) or tryptophan (Escherichia coliWP2 uvrA), using the bacterial reverse mutation assay (modified Ames test). Generally, substantial increases in revertant colony counts were not observed with any of the strains following exposure to the hydrogenation products in the absence or presence of the 10 or 30% S9 mix, which is consistent with the loss of mutagenic activity from these hydrogenation products.",Is hydrogenation products mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False

The mutagenicity of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo (4,5-f) quinoline (IQ) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido (1,2-a:3',2'-d) imidazole (Glu-P-1) toward TA98 was markedly reduced by the addition of glucose-tryptophan MRPs, whereas the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (NQNO) was not inhibited. The mutagenicity of IQ, Glu-P-1, and NQNO toward TA100 was also markedly reduced by glucose-tryptophan MRPs, but the mutagenicity of NQNO was only slightly inhibited. Greater antimutagenic effects of glucose-tryptophan MRPs were found when these materials were prepared at an alkaline pH. The optimum combinations of reaction conditions for obtaining antimutagenic MRPs to IQ were glucose-tryptophan molar ratio = 0.5:0.25 at pH 9.0 for 5 and 10 h, molar ratio = 0.5:0.5 at pH 11.0 for 10 h, and molar ratio = 1.0:0.25 at pH 7.0 for 15 h and at pH 11.0 for 15 h. The antimutagenic effect of glucose-tryptophan MRPs to IQ and Glu-P-1 was well correlated with their browning intensity, reducing power, and antioxidative activity. The antimutagenicity of glucose-tryptophan MRPs might be due to both desmutagenic and bio-antimutagenic effects.",Is NQNO mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1241,"The antimutagenic effects of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) prepared by heating three sugars (fructose, glucose and xylose) and four amino acids (arginine, glycine, lysine and tryptophan) at 100 degrees C for 10 hr was evaluated in the Salmonella/microsome assay. The highest extent of browning was found in the MRPs of sugars-lysine and xylose-amino acids. The MRPs of xylose-amino acids showed stronger antioxidative activity and reducing power than did the other combinations. No mutagenicity or toxicity in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was observed with any of the MRPs in the presence of S-9. Most MRPs, especially those of sugars-tryptophan and xylose-amino acids, strongly inhibited the mutagenicity of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoline (IQ), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyridol-(4,3-b)indole (Trp-P-1) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido(1,2-a:3',2'-d)imidazole (Glu-P-1) in the presence of S-9. However, the MRPs of fructose-glycine and fructose-arginine increased the mutagenicity of Trp-P-1. The antimutagenic effect of the MRPs was well correlated with their antioxidative activity and reducing power. The mutagenicity of benzo[a]pyrene was moderately inhibited by most MRPs, but was increased by the MRP of glucose-arginine. Aflatoxin B1 mutagenicity was increased greatly by all the MRPs except that of xylose-tryptophan. The findings suggested that MRPs might have a bifunctional property of co-mutagenicity and antimutagenicity in certain cases.",Is MRPs mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1242,"The mutagenic activities of 16 kinds of tryptophan metabolites, before and after nitrite treatment, were examined in the Ames test. None of the compounds showed mutagenic activity before nitrite treatment. After nitrite treatment under acidic conditions, 11 compounds showed mutagenic activity towards Salmonella typhimurium TA100 strain in the absence of a metabolic activation system. Tryptophan induced 1000 revertant colonies/mumol, while 5-hydroxyindole, 5-hydroxytryptamine and 3-hydroxykynurenine, all containing a hydroxy group in the molecule, induced 11,000, 5200 and 2700 revertant colonies/mumol, respectively. These results indicate that the introduction by nitrite treatment of a hydroxy group into the indole or benzene ring of tryptophan-related compounds increases their mutagenic activity.",Is tryptophan mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
1243,"Non-volatile reaction products generated from the reactions of 70 mM aqueous chlorine or chlorine dioxide with 10 mM L-tryptophan were shown to be direct-acting mutagens to Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98. Several of the fluorescent bands obtained after thin-layer chromatographic fractionation of the XAD-2/8 resin concentrates of the reaction mixtures were shown to be more mutagenic than the reaction mixtures using the Ames Salmonella/microsome assay. In addition, these fractions were shown to be capable of increasing significantly the frequency of sister chromatid exchange in Chinese hamster ovary cells in the absence of rat liver S9 mix. GC/MS analysis of the products in a highly mutagenic fraction of the aqueous chlorine reaction products identified 1,1,3-trichloropropanone, 1,1,3,3-tetrachloropropanone and dichloroquinoline.",Is Non-volatile reaction products mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1244,"Heated sugar/amino acid reaction mixtures, known to contain products that are clastogenic and/or mutagenic to cells in vitro, were evaluated for clastogenic activity in mouse bone marrow using the erythrocyte micronucleus assay. Heated (i.e. browned) fructose/lysine reaction mixtures were also evaluated in the Salmonella his-reversion assay and the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell chromosomal aberration assay to confirm and extend previous in vitro observations. Significant mutagenicity of fructose/lysine mixtures was observed in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA2637, TA98 and TA102, with greater activity in mixtures heated at pH 10 than at pH 7. S-9 decreased the activity in strains TA100, TA2637 and TA98, but increased the activity in strain TA102. Both pH 7 and pH 10 reaction mixtures of the fructose/lysine browning reaction were highly clastogenic in CHO cells. Heated mixtures of fructose and lysine, and of glucose or ribose with lysine, histidine, tryptophan or cysteine, did not increase the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes in mice when administered by the oral route. This indicates the absence of chromosomal aberrations in erythrocyte precursor cells, and indicates that the genotoxic components of the browned mixtures are not absorbed and distributed to bone marrow cells in amounts sufficient to induce micronuclei when given orally. Because sugar/amino acid browning reactions occur commonly in heated foods, it is important to evaluate further the in vivo genotoxicity of browning products in cell populations other than bone marrow.",Is fructose/lysine mixtures mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1245,"The mutagenic activity of chlorpromazine hydrochloride based on the Ames plate incorporation test and the modified fluctuation test in the presence and absence of liver microsomal enzyme (S9 fraction) and NADPH was determined. The results indicated that chlorpromazine required activation for mutagenic activity for the reversion of some of the tester bacterial strains from tryptophan and histidine dependence to independence respectively. The positive response of Escherichia coli WP2 trp, uvrA, E. coli WP2 trp (pKM101 and pAQ1) and Salmonella typhimurium his TA102 indicated that chlorpromazine mediates base-pair substitution and frame-shift mutagenesis.",Is chlorpromazine mutagenic for pKM101 or TA102 strain?,True
1246,"Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is currently being considered as an alternate to chlorine as a disinfectant for water treatment. Many organic compounds present in water and food treated with ClO2 are subject to oxidation. 21 amino acids and 3 peptides (L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester (aspartame), L-glycyl-L-tryptophan and L-tryptophylglycine) were studied for their reactivity with ClO2. Chlorine dioxide reacted only with 6 amino acids in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. The reaction with cysteine, tryptophan and tyrosine was too rapid to be monitored either iodometrically or spectrophotometrically. The reaction with histidine, hydroxyproline and proline was found to be pseudo-first order. ClO2 readily reacted with L-glycyl-L-tryptophan and L-tryptophylglycine but not with aspartame. Mutagenicity studies with the Salmonella microsome assay of the reaction mixtures of ClO2 with those 6 reactive amino acids and the 3 peptides indicated that the reaction products of the 3 peptides, hydroxyproline, and tyrosine exerted mutagenic activity toward both tester strains of TA98 and TA100 in the presence and absence of rat-liver S9 mix.",Is hydroxyproline mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1247,"The product of six complete bowel movements were collected from one man (consuming a normal western diet) over a period of 5 months. Aqueous faecal extracts were prepared (0.75 g wet wt./ml water) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Graded doses were assayed aerobically and anaerobically for mutagenicity in replicate microtitre fluctuation tests employing histidine reversion in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and tryptophan reversion in Escherichia coli WP2uvrA(pKM101), and in aerobic SOS Chromotests, using E. coli PQ37. The histidine and tryptophan content of each extract was determined by (i) pre-column derivatisation with o-phthaldialdehyde followed by reverse-phase h.p.l.c. and (ii) by aerobic and anaerobic bioassays employing appropriate auxotrophic strains of S. typhimurium and E. coli. All six faecal samples contained enough histidine and tryptophan or their precursors to compromise the interpretation of fluctuation tests. The h.p.l.c. technique, though quantitatively detecting free tryptophan added to faecal extracts, did not account for growth-enhancing effects of faecal extracts detected by bioassay using bacteria with a requirement for tryptophan. However, h.p.l.c. detected histidine more efficiently than bioassays. A combination of reconstruction experiments and bioassays enabled construction of 'growth windows' within which, in fluctuation tests, dose-related increases in numbers of positive wells could be ascribed to mutation rather than to feeding of auxotrophic bacteria. Under aerobic conditions of extraction and assay, five out of six samples were mutagenic to S. typhimurium TA100, and all six were mutagenic to E. coli WP2uvrA(pKM101). None of the samples extracted and assayed anaerobically was mutagenic to S. typhimurium, but all six were positive in E. coli WP2uvrA(pKM101). There was an increase both in faecal histidine and tryptophan and in mutagenicity during the period of collection, the association between faecal tryptophan and faecal mutagenicity being statistically significant. All the samples were negative in the SOS Chromotests. We conclude that this donor regularly excretes faeces which contain at least two classes of water-soluble directly-acting mutagens which are not detected in SOS Chromotest at doses five times those giving positive effects in fluctuation tests.",Is bowel movements mutagenic for pKM101 or TA100 or WP2uvrA strain?,True
1248,"Hepatic S9 preparations from Aroclor 1254 induced rats and 3-methylcholanthrene induced woodchucks were used to investigate, in vitro, the mutagenic potential of five amino acid conjugates of 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (alanine, aspartic acid, leucine, methionine and tryptophan). Five strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA97, TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1538) were utilized for this purpose. Dose-response effects producing a two-fold increase of revertants over spontaneous levels were not observed with either S9 preparation indicating that the amino acid conjugates are not promutagens in these assays.","Is 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?",False
1249,"Three naturally occurring indoles were evaluated for potential nitrosatability using the Nitrosation Assay Procedure (NAP test) as recommended by the World Health Organisation. All three indoles i.e. tryptophan, tryptamine and 5-hydroxy-tryptamine were nitrosated to products which were directly mutagenic for S. typhimurium TA1537. In addition, the products of nitrosation of tryptamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine were also mutagenic for strains TA1538, TA98 and TA1535 without the need for metabolic activation. The sensitivities of the frameshift-detecting strains TA1537, TA1538 and TA98 were of particular interest, since nitroso compounds are characteristically base-substitution mutagens. The mutagenic effects of the products formed after nitrosation of each indole at pH 3.6, were eliminated in the presence of S9 mix. This was not the case when the nitrosation assay was carried out at pH 2.6. At this pH the mutagenicity of the nitrosated products varied in the presence of S9 mix and depended upon the nature of the indole undergoing nitrosation, and the bacterial test strain utilised for the mutagenicity assay. This indicated that more than one mutagenic product was responsible for the observed effects. As well as pH, a number of other factors influenced the formation of mutagenic nitroso products. Most notably, the concentrations of precursor compounds (sodium nitrite, and indole) present in the NAP test were of critical importance. As the sodium nitrite concentration was reduced from that recommended by the W.H.O. (40 mM), so the mutagenicity decreased. For all three compounds significant mutagenic effects were lost at sodium nitrite concentrations below 15 mM. In conclusion the data presented in this paper clearly demonstrates that individuals are chronically exposed to naturally occurring substances which readily nitrosate in excess nitrous acid and yield bacterial mutagens.",Is tryptophan mutagenic for TA98 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
1250,"Pyrolysis products of proteins and amino acids are highly mutagenic, but metabolism of these chemicals by rat liver subcellular fractions is known to be required for production of the mutagenic intermediates. We examined the mutagenesis of seven purified pyrolysis products from tryptophan, lysine, glutamic acid, and soybean globulin with Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the presence of liver fractions from genetically ""responsive"" C57BL/6N and Ah(b)/Ah(d) or ""nonresponsive"" DBA/2N and Ah(d)/Ah(d) mice that had been pretreated in vivo with benzo[a]pyrene. For all pyrolysis products tested, mutagenesis is 2-fold to more than 1000-fold greater with C57BL/6N and Ah(b)/Ah(d) than with DBA/2N or Ah(d)/Ah(d) liver fractions. A sucrose density gradient assay for detecting the Ah regulatory gene product, the receptor, was studied with C57BL/6N hepatic cytosol. At levels 100 times in excess of [1,6-(3)H]2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, nonlabeled 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, 3-methylcholanthrene, and beta-naphthoflavone (inducers of cytochrome P(1)-450) are able to displace the radioligand from its hepatic cytosolic receptor; four pyrolysates from tryptophan, glutamic acid, and soybean globulin did not have this capacity. These data indicate that the pyrolysis products tested, although not effective as inducers of cytochrome P(1)-450, are most mutagenic when metabolized by P(1)-450. Potent P(1)-450 inducers-present in pyrolysates during the combustion process-might be present in quantities insufficient to initiate mutagenesis or carcinogenesis but might have a synergistic action, or act as ""comutagens"" or ""cocarcinogens,"" with the N-containing heterocyclic pyrolysis products. A quantitative relationship between mutagenic and carcinogenic potency of these pyrolysis products remains, however, to be demonstrated.",Is pyrolysis products mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1251,"The charred surface of fish and beef showed strong mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium test strains when activated by S-9 mix of rat liver. The pyrolysis products of proteins and amino acids were also highly mutagenic. Among the pyrolysis products of amino acids, those of tryptophan, serine, and glutamic acid were most active. The new gamma-carboline derivatives, 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole, were purified from the pyrolysis products of tryptophan. These new compounds were stronger mutagens than aflatoxin B1 towards S. typhimurium TA98, a frameshift type mutant, and they also transformed cryopreserved Syrian hamster embryo cells in vitro. Tryptophan pyrolysate also contained the beta-carboline derivatives, norharman and harman, which are not mutagenic alone, but act as comutagens. A mixture of norharman or harman and nonmutagenic aniline or o-toluidine was strongly mutagenic. The mutagenicities of charred products of other foods, such as seaweed and garlic, are reviewed in this article. Flavonoids, such as kaempferol and quercetin, and glycosides of these flavonoles were mutagenic. The mutagenicity of cooked vegetables depends partly on these flavonoid derivatives. The already-known existence of benzol[a]pyrene and nitroso compounds in cooked food is also reviewed.",Is pyrolysis products mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1252,"The mutagenic activities of 6-nitrochrysene (6-NC) and its previously identified metabolites were evaluated in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98 in the presence and absence of metabolic activation by 9000 g supernatant from the livers of rats treated with Aroclor. 6-Aminochrysene (6-AC) and trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-6-aminochrysene (1,2-DHD-6-AC) were the most active mutagens in TA100 upon metabolic activation. 6-NC and 6-AC were the most active mutagens in TA100 in the absence of metabolic activation. Upon metabolic activation, 6-AC was the most active in TA98; the other compounds were weak or inactive depending on the conditions of the assay. In the absence of metabolic activation, the mutagenic activities of 6-NC and its metabolites in TA98 were comparable to those observed in TA100. The major metabolite formed upon incubation of [3H]6-NC with S.typhimurium TA100 and 9000 g supernatant from the livers of Aroclor-induced rats was identified as trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-6-nitrochrysene (1,2-DHD-6-NC); trans-9,10-dihydro-9,10-dihydroxy-6-nitrochrysene and 1,2-dihydroxy-6-nitrochrysene were also identified. The major DNA adduct formed in TA100 under these conditions was chromatographically identical to that previously detected in vivo in the liver and lungs of newborn mice treated with 6-NC, as well as to that obtained upon incubation of 1,2-DHD-6-AC with calf thymus DNA in the presence of rat liver microsomes. The DNA adducts derived from 6-NC in S.typhimurium TA100 without activation were identical to those adducts previously identified after incubation of 6-hydroxylaminochrysene with calf thymus DNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Is 6-Aminochrysene mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

1254,"Sulforaphane, a constituent of broccoli was investigated for its antimutagenic potential against different classes of cooked food mutagens (heterocyclic amines). These include imidazoazaarenes such as 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP); pyridoindole derivatives such as 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2); and, dipyridoimidazole derivative such as 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1). Tests were carried out by Ames Salmonella/reversion assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 (frame shift mutation sensitive) and TA100 (base pair mutation sensitive) bacterial strains in the presence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver S9. Results of these in vitro antimutagenicity studies strongly suggest that sulforaphane is a potent inhibitor of the mutagenicity induced by imidazoazaarenes such as IQ, MeIQ and MeIQx (approximately 60% inhibition) and moderately active against pyridoindole derivatives such as Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 (32-48% inhibition), but ineffective against dipyridoimidazole derivative (Glu-P-1) in TA 100.",Is Sulforaphane mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1255,"Anti-mutagenic and anti-carcinogenic effects of beer on heterocyclic amine (HCA)-induced carcinogenesis were studied in vitro and in vivo. Four commercial beers (two pilsner-type, black, and stout) showed inhibitory effects against five HCAs, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1) and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]-quinoline (IQ), in the Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of rat S9 mix. The inhibitory effects of dark-colored beers (stout and black beer) were greater than those of pilsner-type beers. Dark-colored beers suppressed CYP1A2 activity in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that inhibition of HCA activation is partly responsible for their strong anti-mutagenic effects. Anti-mutagenic effects were also observed when the pooled human S9 mix or activated IQ was used in the assay. The micronucleus test using Chinese hamster lung CHL/IU cells showed that the addition of freeze-dried samples of pilsner-type and stout beer to the culture medium significantly reduced the number of cells with micronuclei induced with PhIP or Trp-P-2. Single-cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay) revealed that oral ingestion of pilsner-type and stout beers for 1 week significantly inhibited DNA damage in the liver cells of male ICR mice exposed to MeIQx (13 mg/kg, i.p.). A decrease in the formation of DNA adducts was also observed using a 32P-postlabeling method. Male Fischer 344 rats orally received PhIP (75 mg/kg, five times a week for 2 weeks) and aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation in the colon was analyzed after 5 weeks. The number of ACF was significantly reduced in rats fed a diet containing freeze-dried beer. These results suggest that beer inhibits the genotoxic effects of HCAs and may reduce the risk of carcinogenesis caused by food borne carcinogens.",Is beer mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1256,"Four prenylated flavanones were isolated from the methanol extract of the flowers of Azadirachta indica (the neem tree) as potent antimutagens against Trp-P-1 (3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole) in the Salmonella typhimurium TA98 assay by activity-guided fractionation. Spectroscopic properties revealed that those compounds were 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-8-prenylflavanone (1), 5,4'-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-8-prenylflavanone (2), 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3',8-diprenylflavanone (3), and 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3',5'-diprenylflavanone (4). All isolated compounds were found for the first time in this plant. The antimutagenic IC(50) values of compounds 1-4 were 2.7 +/- 0.1, 3.7 +/- 0.1, 11.1 +/- 0.1, and 18.6 +/- 0.1 microM in the preincubation mixture, respectively. These compounds also similarly inhibited the mutagenicity of Trp-P-2 (3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole) and PhIP (2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine). All of the compounds 1-4 strongly inhibited ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylation activity of cytochrome P450 1A isoforms, which catalyze N-hydroxylation of heterocyclic amines. However, compounds 1-4 did not show significant inhibition against the direct-acting mutagen NaN(3). Thus, the antimutagenic effect of compounds 1-4 would be mainly based on the inhibition of the enzymatic activation of heterocyclic amines.",Is flavanones mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1257,"Dibenzoylmethane (DBM), a structural analogue of curcumin (a bioactive phytochemical present in a widely used spice turmeric) was screened for its inhibitory effect against seven cooked food mutagens (heterocyclic amines): 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1), in both TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium using Ames Salmonella/reversion assay in the presence of Aroclor1254-induced rat liver S9 homogenate. DBM has been reported to antagonize the mutagenicity of several chemical carcinogens in vitro and has recently been shown to be even more effective than curcumin in suppressing the 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumors in rats. But there are no reports regarding its antimutagenic properties against cooked food mutagens. Results of the present investigations clearly indicate that dibenzoylmethane is a very potent antimutagenic agent, that could effectively inhibit mutagenicity induced by all the tested cooked food mutagens in both the frame shift (TA98) as well as the base pair mutation sensitive (TA100) strains of S. typhimurium. These highly potent inhibitory effects of dibenzoylmethane against heterocyclic amines observed in our preliminary investigations strongly warrant further studies of its efficacy as a cancer chemopreventive agent.",Is Dibenzoylmethane mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1258,"Curcumin (C) and its natural analogues demethoxycurcumin (dmC) and bisdemethoxycurcumin (bdmC), known for their potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic effects, were tested for their possible inhibitory effects against seven cooked food mutagens (heterocyclic amines): 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1), in both TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium using Ames Salmonella/reversion assay in the presence of Aroclor induced rat liver S9 homogenate. In the present investigations, curcumin as well as its two natural analogues i.e., dmC and bdmC were found to be highly effective in suppressing genotoxicity of all the tested cooked food mutagens in a dose-dependent manner, in both the frame shift (TA98) as well as base pair mutation sensitive (TA100) strains of S. typhimurium. However, bdmC appeared to be a relatively less active antimutagen compared to C and dmC. More than 80% inhibition of mutagenicity was observed at 200 microg/plate in case of C and dmC in both TA98 and TA100 against all tested cooked food mutagens. Where as, bdmC showed 39-79% inhibition in TA100 and 60-80% inhibition in TA98, at a dose of 200 microg/plate. These findings warrant further biochemical, enzymatic and in vivo investigations in animal models as well as in humans to establish the chemoprotective effect of these agents against mutagenic heterocyclic amines found in cooked food.",Is bdmC mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1259,"The effects of cacao liquor proanthocyanidins (CLPr) on 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP)-induced mutagenesis in vitro and on in vivo carcinogenesis in female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were investigated. In the Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA98, CLPr showed strong antimutagenic effects against PhIP when assayed in the presence of S-9 mixture. For determination of the influence on initiation and subsequent development of lesions, CLPr (0.025% or 0.25%) were fed during the period of PhIP application (100 mg/kg given to rats via gastric tubes eight times over 4 weeks), or thereafter until the termination at 48 weeks. CLPr treatments did not affect body or organ weights. The incidences, multiplicities and volumes of mammary tumors in the 0.25% CLPr (post-initiation) group showed a tendency to decrease as compared to PhIP alone group values, although without statistical significance. The incidences of preneoplastic eosinophilic foci in the exocrine pancreas were significantly (P<0.05) decreased in a dose-dependent manner when CLPr were given during the initiation period. These results indicate that CLPr inhibit in vitro mutagenicity of PhIP, as well as rat pancreatic carcinogenesis in the initiation stage, but not mammary carcinogenesis induced by PhIP.",Is CLPr mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1260,"The TNO gastro-Intestinal tract Model (TIM) is a dynamic computer-controlled in vitro system that mimics the human physiological conditions in the stomach and small intestine. In the current TIM physiological parameters such as pH, temperature, peristaltic movements, secretion of digestion enzymes, bile and pancreatic juices, and absorption of digested products-by removal through dialysis-was simulated. Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAA; viz. IQ, MeIQ, MeIQx and PhIP) were used as model compounds for food mutagens, and the passage through TIM was investigated for each of these compounds separately. Subsequently, the influence of a matrix and different rates of passage on the availability for absorption and distribution were studied in experiments with prepared meat, supplemented with MeIQx. Samples taken at various time points from the jejunal and ileal dialysates and from the lumen at the end of the small intestine (ileal delivery) were tested for the presence of mutagenic activity in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 as indicator, in the presence of mammalian metabolic activation (rat S9 mix). The results show that, comparable with the human in vivo situation, all four HAA are quickly removed (approx. 50% in 2 hr; approx. 95% in 6 hr) and mainly recovered from the lumen into the jejunal and ileal dialysates (94% of recovery). Only 5+/-1.5% is recovered in the chyme at the end of the small intestine. When MeIQx was added to meat, its availability for absorption was slower, although the influence of the gastrointestinal passage time on the availability of MeIQx was more pronounced than this matrix effect. More MeIQx was found in the jejunal dialysate (23%; P<0.01) and less in the ileal delivery (8%; P<0.01) when simulating the gastrointestinal passage of solid meals was compared to simulating that of liquid meals. The present experiments demonstrate that TIM can be applied to study in vitro the availability of heterocyclic aromatic amines in the gastrointestinal tract. More generally, these studies indicate that TIM shows promise as a useful tool for various research purposes dealing with the availability for absorption of mutagenic as well as antimutagenic components in food.",Is TIM mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1261,"Aqueous solutions of gallic acid, methyl gallate, catechins, theaflavins and tannic acid were tested for inhibition of the mutagenicity of PhIP in the Salmonella typhimurium TA98 assay with an S9 fraction from the liver of rats induced with alpha-naphthoflavone and phenobarbital. The IC50S were in the 80-250 microM range for the gallated catechins, theaflavins and tannic acid. No inhibition could be found with these compounds when a direct acting mutagen was used. This indicates that the anti-mutagenic properties of these phenolic compounds may be due to their inhibition of the cytochrome P-450 enzymes.","Is methyl gallate,catechins,theaflavins mutagenic for TA98 strain?",False
1262,"A major target tissue for carcinogenesis from the cooked-food carcinogen 2-amino-l-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) in rodents is the colon, yet the role of colon metabolism on the carcinogenicity of PhIP is not clearly understood. The mutagenic potency of PhIP is highly dependent upon cytochrome P450 N-hydroxylation. In the present study, the ability of rat colon tissue to activate PhIP to a mutagen was investigated in Salmonella typhimurium (strains TA98 and YGI024) and rat colon tissue slices. In the Ames/Salmonella assay, using rat colon S9 as the activating system, no mutations were evident from bacteria exposed to PhIP at any concentration tested. However, mutations were observed when bacteria were exposed to 2-aminoanthracene (2AA) and colon S9, indicating sufficient P450 activity in the S9 to activate 2AA but not PhIP. In rat colon slice preparations, the sulfotransferase and acetyltransferase inhibitors pentachlorophenol (PCP) and 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol (DCNP) were used to modulate DNA adduct and metabolite formation. Incubations of 3-methylcholanthrene-induced colon slices dosed with 50 microMolar [(3)H]PhIP produced no detectable metabolites. However, incubations of uninduced slices exposed to 10 microMolar of the reactive intermediate, [(3)H]2-(hydroxyamino)-l-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (N-hydroxy-PhIP), produced a single detectable metabolite, a glucuronide conjugate of N-hydroxy-PhIP. This metabolite decreased when PCP or DCNP was added to the incubation medium. DNA adducts were detected in colon slices exposed to N-hydroxy-PhIP at approximately 33 adducts/10(7) nucleotides. Interestingly, when PCP was added to the incubation mixture, an increase in DNA adduct levels was detected, whereas DCNP produced a decrease in adducts. Because these inhibitors are thought to have similar mechanisms with regard to sulfotransferase inhibition, the inverse relationship in DNA adduct levels due to PCP or DCNP treatment is at present unexplainable. The formation of DNA adducts and metabolites from colon slices exposed to N-hydroxy-PhIP but not PhIP implies that there is insufficient P450 activity in the rat colon to activate PhIP to hydroxylated metabolites, suggesting that the rat colon is a site of Phase II metabolism for PhIP and that the liver is the primary source for hydroxylation.",Is PhIP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1263,"Solutions of lyophilized preparations of standard black and green tea extracts were made and tested over a range of six concentrations as inhibitors of the mutagenicity caused by the fool mutagen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) in the Salmonella typhimurium TA98 assay containing S9 fraction from rats induced with alpha-naphthoflavone and phenobarbital. Extracts of both black and green tea were equally good inhibitors of mutagenicity. Purified polyphenols were prepared from tea extracts by solvent extraction. The polyphenols of black tea were more potent inhibitors of mutagenicity than the polyphenols of green tea. These findings suggest that black tea may have similar health-promoting properties to those reported previously for green tea.",Is PhIP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1264,"Airborne cooking by-products from frying beef (hamburgers), pork (bacon strips) and soybean-based food (tempeh burgers) were collected, extracted, tested for mutagenicity and chemically analysed. The fumes generated by frying pork and beef were mutagenic, with 4900 and 1300 revertants/g of food cooked, respectively. No mutagenicity was detected in fumes from frying tempeh burgers. Bacon fried to a well-done but non-charred state was eight times more mutagenic in a microsuspension Ames/Salmonella test (TA98 with S-9) than hamburgers and about 350 times more mutagenic than tempeh burgers. Among food samples cooked to a well-done, non-charred state, bacon strips had almost 15-fold more mass (109.5 ng/g) than that of the beef, whereas no heterocyclic amine (HCA) was detected in the fried tempeh burgers. 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) was the most abundant HCA, followed by 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx). No 2-amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (A alpha C) was detected in the food samples fried at about 200 degrees C, although it was present in the collected airborne products. The total amounts of HCAs in the smoke condensates were 3 ng/g from fried bacon, 0.37 ng/g from fried beef and 0.177 ng/g from fried soy-based food. This study indicates that cooks are potentially exposed to relatively high levels of airborne mutagens and carcinogens and that long-term sampling inside restaurants and kitchens may be warranted in order to assess the potential risk of prolonged exposure.",Is tempeh mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1265,"The correlation of bacterial mutagenicity with DNA adducts from the heterocyclic amine cooked-food mutagen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) was investigated in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 (uvrB deficient) and TA1978 (uvrB proficient). Bacterial cells were exposed to PhIP using a modification of the Ames/Salmonella microsuspension assay. Half of the cells, generated from a 90 min pre-incubation and washing, were plated for revertant formation while the remaining half was subjected to DNA adduct analysis via 32P-postlabeling. In TA98, DNA adducts were detected at an RAL (relative adduct labeling) of 10 x 10(-7) and 21 x 10(-7) at PhIP concentrations of 5.5 and 17 microM, respectively. This corresponded to 28.8 and 20.9 adducts/revertant, respectively. These values were based on the assumption that only four repeating GC bases within a 75 DNA base region is the gene target site for PhIP induced mutations. In TA1978, no revertants above background were detected at any concentration of PhIP tested. DNA adducts, however, were detected at 11 x 10(-7) and 21 x 10(-7) adducts per nucleotide at 223 and 1116 microM PhIP, respectively. The lack of detectable revertants, but the presence of DNA adducts, suggests pre-mutational lesions did occur during the 90 min pre-incubation. Presumably, when the S9 activating system and PhIP were removed (via washing with phosphate buffered saline) prior to plating, the cells containing an intact uvrB repair system repaired the lesions during the incubation time on the plates. In conclusion, the induction of revertants by adducts appears quite efficient, as approximately 25 adducts are required for one mutational event in the excision repair deficient bacteria.",Is PhIP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1266,"Standard black and green tea extracts have been known to inhibit mutagenicity caused by PhIP, in the Salmonella typhimurium TA98 assay containing S9 fraction from the liver of rats induced with alpha-naphthoflavone and phenobarbital. Breeding and selection programs for high yielding tea clones have successfully increased yields in many tea producing areas. Six clonal teas and three seedling teas were obtained from a tea producing area in Southern Africa. Standard black and green teas were used as controls. Dose-dependent inhibition of the bacterial mutagenicity elicited by two concentrations of PhIP was found in the extracts of all the teas tested. This indicates that the clonal teas have not lost their anti-mutagenic properties. Small differences were found amongst the clonal teas in their ability to inhibit mutagenicity. This indicates that it may be possible to enhance this trait in future breeding and selection programs.",Is green tea mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1267,"The mutagenic activity and the mass amount of heterocyclic amines responsible for the mutagenic activity have been measured in some cooked foods. Cooked meats are the predominant source of mutagenic activity in the diet with values ranging from 0 to 10,000 revertants per gram reported in the Ames/Salmonella test with strain TA98. Several heterocyclic amines are present and have been quantified using solid-phase extraction followed by HPLC. Frying at higher temperatures and for longer times produces the greatest mutagenic response, and concomitantly, the largest amounts of heterocyclic amines. Most of the mutagenic activity in fried meat samples can be accounted for by MeIQx(2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-b]quinoxaline), DiMeIQx (2-amino-3,4,8-dimethylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoxaline) and IQ (2-amino-3-methylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoline), although other heterocyclic amines are present and PhIP (2-amino-3-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine) mutagenic activity becomes significant at higher temperatures. Non-meat products such as baked breads can also form significant mutagenic activity, particularly when overcooked. Commercially prepared hamburgers made from meat substitutes such as tofu, wheat gluten or tempeh and fried at 210 degrees C have up to 10% of the mutagenic activity of a fried beef patty cooked under the same conditions. When detected, amounts of heterocyclic amines in fried beef patties range from a total of 0.35 ng/g for commercial beef hamburgers to 142 ng/g for a beef patty cooked over a barbecue. Dietary intake is expected to have a large range, from less than one microgram per day to over 50 micrograms per day based on current knowledge of known heterocyclic amine chemicals and heterocyclic amine-containing foods.",Is PhIP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1268,"The distribution, DNA adduction and excretion into breast milk of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) were examined in lactating female F344 rats with 5 day old pups. Six hours after a single dose (10 mg/kg, p.o.) of radiolabeled IQ, MeIQx or PhIP to lactating dams, radioactivity in the dams was highest in the liver and kidney followed, in descending order, by the mammary gland, omental fat and brain. By 24 h after carcinogen administration, all tissues of the dams showed significantly reduced levels of radioactivity except for omental fat which changed only marginally from 6 to 24 h. 32P-Postlabeling analysis showed that the level of DNA adducts in mammary gland 6 h after dosing was 2.2, 0.7 and 0.2 adducts/10(7) nucleotides for PhIP, IQ and MeIQx respectively. In contrast, in hepatic DNA, the levels of IQ-DNA adducts (5.5 adducts/10(7) nucleotides) were 11-fold higher than those of PhIP or MeIQx. The stomach contents, liver, kidney and urine of pups nursed by dams given radiolabeled IQ, MeIQx or PhIP were radioactive, indicating that these carcinogens (and/or metabolites) were excreted into breast milk and absorbed by the pups. After a 6 h suckling period, the amount of PhIP-derived radioactivity in the stomach contents of the pups was approximately 10-fold higher than that seen with IQ or MeIQx. Urine from pups from the three groups was mutagenic in the Ames assay with Salmonella TA98 in the presence of an S9 activating system. IQ-, MeIQx- and PhIP-DNA adducts, at levels in the range of 0.25-0.46 adducts per 10(8) nucleotides, were detected in the livers of pups using the 32P-postlabeling method under intensification conditions. The results from this study indicate that breast milk is a route of exposure of the newborn to heterocyclic amines. The presence of DNA adducts in the tissues of pups further suggests that this route of exposure may have a carcinogenic consequence to the newborn.",Is Urine from pups mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1269,"Extracts of human urine were shown to contain substances that strongly inhibited the liver S9-mediated mutagenicity of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 strain in a liquid incubation assay. The inhibitory effect was unrelated to cytotoxicity and was similar with urine extracts from smokers and non-smokers. Under similar assay conditions, the mutagenicity of the related amino-imidazoazaarenes, 2-amino-3-methyl-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]-quinoline and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline was also found to be strongly inhibited by urine extracts. Decreased or enhanced mutagenicity was seen with 2-acetyl-aminofluorene and 2-aminoanthracene depending on the type of assay, and the time of incubation in liquid medium. A weak inhibition of the mutagenicity of 2-nitrofluorene, a direct-acting mutagen, was observed only after a short incubation time. Mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide was not altered by the presence of urine extracts at concentrations shown to be inhibitory for the mutagenicity of heterocyclic aromatic amines. Our data suggest that the inhibitory substances in urine act through their capacity to non covalently bind the parent heterocyclic and aromatic amines, thus affecting their availability in aqueous medium for diffusion into liver microsomes where metabolic activation takes place.",Is PhIP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

The assay used Salmonella typhimurium TA98 as an indicator of the mutagenicity and hepatic post-mitochondrial fractions (S-9) from male Sprague-Dawley rats as the activating system. All three fatty acids inhibited the mutagenicity of IQ without effect on the uptake of the active metabolites and/or on the DNA repair processes within the bacterial cell.

1272,"Azido-PhIP (2-azido-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine) and nitro-PhIP (2-nitro-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine) have been synthesized and characterized chemically. The mutagenic potencies of azido-PhIP (with photoactivation by near UV irradiation), of nitro-PhIP (without exogenous activation) and of the heterocyclic amine PhIP (with activation by rat liver S9) were evaluated by means of the reversion assay in Salmonella typhimurium. Like PhIP, azido- and nitro-PhIP were potent mutagens in the strain TA98. In addition to TA98, the strains YG1024 with increased and TA98/1,8-DNP6 deficient in acetyltransferase activity and TA98NR deficient in nitroreductase were used. Photolysis of azido-PhIP generates a very short-lived mutagen whose mutagenic potency is similar in all strains used and therefore not dependent on the acetyltransferase and nitroreductase. These findings are analogous to previous ones with azidofluorene and suggest that a short-lived DNA-binding arylnitrenium ion is formed directly by the photolysis of azido-PhIP. The nitroreductase contributes to the mutagenic potency of nitro-PhIP; in TA98NR it is 37% of that in TA98. The acetylator status of the strains influences the mutagenic potencies of PhIP and nitro-PhIP only weakly. This contrasts with findings obtained with 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and nitro-IQ and with other amino- and nitro-imidazoarenes which lose most of their mutagenic activity in the acetyltransferase-deficient strain. This atypical behavior of PhIP suggests that the presumed metabolite, N-hydroxy-PhIP, differs from the N-hydroxy metabolites of other heterocyclic amino- and nitro-imidazoarenes in that in Salmonella it is not significantly activated by O-acetylation. It must therefore either react directly with DNA or be activated in a different way. This divergent behavior of PhIP and N-hydroxy-PhIP in Salmonella may also be a key to the understanding of several 'unusual' properties of PhIP in mammalian cells and organisms.",Is azido-PhIP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1273,"Hepatic microsomes from rats pretreated with PCB were found to metabolize the food mutagen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo(4,5-b)pyridine (PhIP) to two major metabolites, one of which was identified as the N-hydroxy derivative, 2-hydroxy-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo(4,5-b)pyridine (N-OH-PhIP). This identification was based on mass spectral (MS), UV and HPLC data by comparison with N-OH-PhIP prepared by chemical synthesis, as well as the specific activity of the compound in the Ames Salmonella test. Synthetic N-OH-PhIP was prepared by catalytic reduction of the nitro derivative of PhIP, which was synthesized from PhIP by diazotization and reaction with sodium nitrite. N-OH-PhIP was mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium TA98 without metabolic activation and had a specific mutagenic activity of 2700 revertants/nmol. N-OH-PhIP thus seems to be a proximate mutagenic metabolite of PhIP. Other direct acting mutagens were not detected in the microsomal incubation mixture after HPLC separation. N-OH-PhIP also induced sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO cells) without metabolic activation. The specific activity of N-OH-PhIP in this assay was approximately 3 times higher than the activity of PhIP with microsomal activation.",Is N-OH-PhIP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

Three types of human meals were compared: raw (C), heated (D) and heated with vegetables and fruit (E, a complete meal). In addition 2 animal diets were tested: commercial control diet (A), and a control diet to which vegetables and fruit had been added (B). All human diets contained: 40.6 energy (E)% fat, 13.2 E% protein, 46.2 E% carbohydrate and 5.2% (w/w) fibre. For animal diets these figures were 21.6, 26.0, 52.4 and 10.7% respectively. After extraction samples were tested in the Salmonella-microsome test, tester strains TA1538, TA98 and TA100. Human diets with heated products (D, E) were both clearly mutagenic with approximately 300-500 revertants per gram. Food pellets from animal diets (A, B) displayed no mutagenic activity. HPLC-derived chromatographic fractions of diets D and E showed 3 large mutagenic areas identified as IQ (2-amino-3 methyl-imidazo-[4,5-f]quinoline) and MeIQx (2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, DiMeIQx (2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline and PhIP (2-amino-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine) and other mutagens not completely defined. This mutagen profile was similar to that found previously for fried beef. Mass estimates for these potent mutagens amounted to 15-20 micrograms/kg. Health implications of these findings are discussed. As IQ, MeIOx and DiMeIQx have been found to be weakly carcinogenic in rodents and many other initiating and modulating factors may be present in a complex human diet, a chronic toxicity study is indicated.",Is Food pellets mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

The bacteria contained significantly higher concentrations of beta-lyase than mammalian subcellular fractions. Bacterial 100,000 X g supernatants cleaved benzthiazolylcysteine to equimolar amounts of mercaptobenzthiazole and pyruvate. DCVC, TCVC and PCBC produced a linear time-dependent increase in pyruvate formation when incubated with bacterial 100,000 X g supernatants; pyruvate formation was inhibited by the beta-lyase inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA). CPC was not cleaved by bacterial enzymes to pyruvate. DCVC, TCVC and PCBC were mutagenic in three strains of S. typhimurium (TA100, TA2638 and TA98) in the Ames-test without addition of mammalian subcellular fractions; their mutagenicity was decreased by the addition of AOAA to the preincubation mixture. CPC was not mutagenic in any of the strains of bacteria tested. These results indicate that beta-lyase plays a key role in the metabolism and mutagenicity of haloalkenylcysteines when tested in S. typhimurium systems.

1278,"Increase in production of different types of plastics has led to increase in the amount of plastic waste generation worldwide. The chemical constituents of these plastic wastes have made their disposal an important economic and environmental health problem globally. This study assessed the mutagenic and genotoxic potential of plastic waste dumpsite raw and simulated leachates using the Ames Salmonella fluctuation test with  Salmonella typhimurium  strains TA98 and TA100, and the SOS chromotest with  Escherichia coli  PQ37. Physico-chemical parameters and organic constituents of the leachates were also analyzed. The result of the Ames test showed that the leachates are mutagenic even at low concentration. Also, the TA100 strain was the more responsive strain in terms of mutagenic index in the absence of metabolic activation. The SOS chromotest results complimented the Ames Salmonella fluctuation test results. Nevertheless, the  E. coli  PQ37 system was slightly more sensitive than the Salmonella assay for detecting mutagens and genotoxins in the tested leachates. Generally, simulated leachate showed a higher mutagenicity and genotoxicity than the raw leachate. Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, Cu, As, PBDEs, PAHs, PCBs, and Bisphenol A contents analyzed in the leachates were believed to play significant role in the observed mutagenicity and genotoxicity in the microbial assays. These data showed that plastic waste constituents are capable of inducing DNA damage in exposed organisms and might induce similar damage in plants, animals and humans exposed to it, hence, great care should be taken to eliminate indiscriminate disposal of plastics in the environment.",Is Bisphenol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1279,"Unpolymerized dental monomers can leach out into the oral biophase and are bioavailable for metabolism. We hypothesize that metabolites would be less toxic than parent monomers. We first identified the formation of metabolites from bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE) and Bisphenol A glycidyl methacrylate (BISGMA) after their exposure to liver S9 fractions. Then, the metabolites and parent compounds were subjected to in vitro cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and estrogenicity studies. Bisphenol A bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether and bisphenol F bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether were the hydroxylated metabolites of BISGMA and BFDGE, respectively. Cytotoxicity against L929 cells showed that the metabolites were significantly (p < 0.05) less cytotoxic than the parent monomers. Only BFDGE was mutagenic in the Ames assay with strain TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium. Parent and metabolite compounds did not stimulate estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cell proliferation above solvent controls. These results indicated that the hydroxylated metabolites were non-mutagenic, non-estrogenic, and less cytotoxic than their parent monomers.",Is BFDGE mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1280,"Bisphenol A (4,4'-isopropylidenediphenol) is a common component of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Since bisphenol A-containing plastics and resins have found uses in food-contact items, its potential migration into foodstuffs and possible health consequences have been the focus of many recent studies. However, the potential mutagenic activation of bisphenol A by nitrosylation has received little attention. Incubation of bisphenol A with sodium nitrite under acidic conditions produced a yellow-brown product. When nitrosylated bisphenol A was tested in the Ames Salmonella/microsome assay at 100 ng to 1 mg/plate, dose-dependent increases in mutagenicity were found in both TA98 and TA100 Salmonella strains. These results indicated the presence of a direct-acting mutagenic activity causing both frameshift and base pair mutations, respectively. When compared to colony formation in untreated controls, the addition of rat liver S9 for metabolic activation had little influence on revertant colony formation. Unreacted bisphenol A dissolved in DMSO, acidic buffer, or inactivated nitrosylation solution showed negligible mutagenicity. When the nature of the mutagenic changes was examined using the Ames II trade mark Assay, a variety of base pair changes was found including T:A to A:T - S9, G:C to A:T +/- S9,C:G to A:T +/- S9 and C:G to G:C +/- S9. Bisphenol A also induced frameshift mutations at G:C sites. In addition, the presence of electrophiles was shown by the production of an intensely coloured orange-red product upon incubation of nitrosylated bisphenol A with the nucleophile 4-(4'-nitrobenzyl)pyridine. These findings suggest that migration of bisphenol A into nitrite containing foodstuffs, or its ingestion in the presence of nitrite, could lead to the formation of mutagenic compounds.",Is Bisphenol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

Mutagenicity was determined in different Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102) and in V79 cells in the presence and in the absence of a metabolically active microsomal fraction from rat liver (S9). No mutagenic effects were observed with Bis-GMA and UDMA, methyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate and bisphenol A. Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) was mutagenic in a dose-dependent manner in three Salmonella tester strains. The number of mutants was increased by a factor of 2 to 3 with strains TA97a and TA102 in the absence of S9. Moreover, the numbers of mutants induced in S. typhimurium TA100 were about 8-fold higher than in solvent controls. GMA also induced an increase of mutants in V79 cells in the absence of S9. However, GMA was inactivated by microsomal enzymes. Triethylenglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) was not mutagenic in any S. typhimurium. In contrast, the compound induced a dose-dependent rise in mutant frequencies in V79 cell cultures. It is concluded that TEGDMA acted through a clastogenic mechanism which is not detected by Ames tester strains.",Is Bisphenol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
1282,"Increase in production of different types of plastics has led to increase in the amount of plastic waste generation worldwide. The chemical constituents of these plastic wastes have made their disposal an important economic and environmental health problem globally. This study assessed the mutagenic and genotoxic potential of plastic waste dumpsite raw and simulated leachates using the Ames Salmonella fluctuation test with  Salmonella typhimurium  strains TA98 and TA100, and the SOS chromotest with  Escherichia coli  PQ37. Physico-chemical parameters and organic constituents of the leachates were also analyzed. The result of the Ames test showed that the leachates are mutagenic even at low concentration. Also, the TA100 strain was the more responsive strain in terms of mutagenic index in the absence of metabolic activation. The SOS chromotest results complimented the Ames Salmonella fluctuation test results. Nevertheless, the  E. coli  PQ37 system was slightly more sensitive than the Salmonella assay for detecting mutagens and genotoxins in the tested leachates. Generally, simulated leachate showed a higher mutagenicity and genotoxicity than the raw leachate. Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, Cu, As, PBDEs, PAHs, PCBs, and Bisphenol A contents analyzed in the leachates were believed to play significant role in the observed mutagenicity and genotoxicity in the microbial assays. These data showed that plastic waste constituents are capable of inducing DNA damage in exposed organisms and might induce similar damage in plants, animals and humans exposed to it, hence, great care should be taken to eliminate indiscriminate disposal of plastics in the environment.",Is PBDEs mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1283,"Unpolymerized dental monomers can leach out into the oral biophase and are bioavailable for metabolism. We hypothesize that metabolites would be less toxic than parent monomers. We first identified the formation of metabolites from bisphenol F diglycidyl ether (BFDGE) and Bisphenol A glycidyl methacrylate (BISGMA) after their exposure to liver S9 fractions. Then, the metabolites and parent compounds were subjected to in vitro cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and estrogenicity studies. Bisphenol A bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether and bisphenol F bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether were the hydroxylated metabolites of BISGMA and BFDGE, respectively. Cytotoxicity against L929 cells showed that the metabolites were significantly (p < 0.05) less cytotoxic than the parent monomers. Only BFDGE was mutagenic in the Ames assay with strain TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium. Parent and metabolite compounds did not stimulate estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cell proliferation above solvent controls. These results indicated that the hydroxylated metabolites were non-mutagenic, non-estrogenic, and less cytotoxic than their parent monomers.",Is hydroxylated metabolites mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
1284,"Bisphenol A (4,4'-isopropylidenediphenol) is a common component of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Since bisphenol A-containing plastics and resins have found uses in food-contact items, its potential migration into foodstuffs and possible health consequences have been the focus of many recent studies. However, the potential mutagenic activation of bisphenol A by nitrosylation has received little attention. Incubation of bisphenol A with sodium nitrite under acidic conditions produced a yellow-brown product. When nitrosylated bisphenol A was tested in the Ames Salmonella/microsome assay at 100 ng to 1 mg/plate, dose-dependent increases in mutagenicity were found in both TA98 and TA100 Salmonella strains. These results indicated the presence of a direct-acting mutagenic activity causing both frameshift and base pair mutations, respectively. When compared to colony formation in untreated controls, the addition of rat liver S9 for metabolic activation had little influence on revertant colony formation. Unreacted bisphenol A dissolved in DMSO, acidic buffer, or inactivated nitrosylation solution showed negligible mutagenicity. When the nature of the mutagenic changes was examined using the Ames II trade mark Assay, a variety of base pair changes was found including T:A to A:T - S9, G:C to A:T +/- S9,C:G to A:T +/- S9 and C:G to G:C +/- S9. Bisphenol A also induced frameshift mutations at G:C sites. In addition, the presence of electrophiles was shown by the production of an intensely coloured orange-red product upon incubation of nitrosylated bisphenol A with the nucleophile 4-(4'-nitrobenzyl)pyridine. These findings suggest that migration of bisphenol A into nitrite containing foodstuffs, or its ingestion in the presence of nitrite, could lead to the formation of mutagenic compounds.",Is Bisphenol A mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

1286,"Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages throughout the world. So far, many studies have shown the properties of coffee beverages, but little is known about its impacts on human and environmental health from its discard in the environment. So, the present work aims to investigate the mutagenic, genotoxic, cytotoxic and ecotoxic effects of leached (LE) and solubilized (SE) extracts from coffee waste, simulating the disposal of this residue in landfills and via sewage systems, respectively. Chemical analyses were also carried out. LE and SE induced mutagenicity in the TA98 Salmonella strain with and without exogenous metabolization (S9). In the TA100 only SE induced mutagenicity, what was observed without S9. An increase in the frequency of micronuclei was observed in HepG2 cell line after 3 and 24h of exposure to both extracts. No cytotoxic effects were observed in HepG2 cells by WST-1 assay. The EC50 values for the LE and SE were 1.5% and 11.26% for Daphnia similis, 0.12% and 1.39% for Ceriodaphnia dubia and 6.0% and 5.5% for Vibrio fischeri, respectively. Caffeine and several transition metals were found in both extracts.

1287,"Tea is one of the most popular beverages consumed worldwide. The relationship between tea consumption and human cancer incidence is an important concern. The effect of tea extract and ingredients, polyphenol and caffeine on the mutagenicity of Sodium Azide was examined in vitro by using Salmonella typhimurium TA100, TA98 and TA1535 in the presence of induced rat liver S9 fractions. Experimental studies have demonstrated the significant antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic effects of both Green and Black tea and its polyphenol and caffeine multiple mutational assay. Caffeine was the less active. Tea comes in many variants. Common tea such as Black tea contains little antioxidant and the amount of caffeine.

1288,"Nine coffee preparations, four caffeinated instant brands, three caffeinated drip coffees, and two decaffeinated coffees, one of which was an instant brand, were evaluated for mutagenicity by the Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA100, TA102, and TA104. All the coffees contained direct-acting mutagens, which reverted the three strains. The inclusion of a rat microsomal enzyme preparation reduced the mutagenic response of the three strains in the presence of some of the coffee samples. Both glyoxal and methylglyoxal, 1,2-dicarbonyls found in the coffees were mutagenic. The concentration of glyoxal, methyglyoxal, diacetyl, and guiacol were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Caffeine, furfural, and 5-methylfurfural concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Although lower concentrations of methyglyoxal were found in the drip caffeinated coffees, the mutagenic potency of these preparations was higher than the instant coffees on a weight basis especially when TA104 was the indicator organism. Our findings agree with those of other workers who have shown that carbonyl compounds, which were present in all the brands tested, are partially responsible for the mutagenic response of coffee but that additional mutagens are also present.",Is Caffeine mutagenic for TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1289,"Textile dyes can enter the water ecosystem through wastewater discharges potentially exposing humans through the consumption of water and food. The commercial disperse dye product CI Disperse Blue 291 containing the aminoazobenzene 2-[(2-bromo-4,6-dinitrophenyl)azo]-5-(diethylamino)-4-methoxyacetanilide (CAS registry no. 56548-64-2) was tested for mutagenic activity in the Salmonella assay. We used strains with different levels of nitroreductase and O-acetyltransferase (i.e., TA98DNP6, YG1024, and YG1041) that are relevant enzymes in the activation of nitrocompounds by the intestinal microflora. The commercial product tested also was mutagenic for TA1537, TA1538, TA98 and TA100. Presence of the pKM101 plasmid and the addition of S9 enhanced the mutagenic response. Specialized strains showed that both nitroreductase and O-acetyltransferase are important in activation of the product. The highest potency obtained was 240 revertants per microgram for YG1041 in the presence of S9. Besides being able to cause frameshift mutations (hisd3052), the dye was able to cause all types of base pair substitution with a preference for TA to AT; CG to TA and CG to AT changes. With these results clearly showing that the bacterial nitroreductase and O-acetyltransferase metabolites of this compound are mutagenic, there is a need to test this dye using in vivo systems to verify possible adverse effects of this product in mammalian tissues.",Is 56548-64-2 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or pKM101 or TA1537 strain?,True

When tested from 1 to 100 microg/plate without nitrosylation, ATX I was mutagenic in TA102+/-rat liver S9 for activation and weakly mutagenic in TA104+/-S9, demonstrating direct-acting AT base pair mutagenicity. AOH was also directly mutagenic at AT sites in TA102+/-S9 while AME was weakly mutagenic in TA102+/-S9 and TA104+S9. Nitrosylation of ATX I enhanced mutagenicity at AT sites in TA104+/-S9 but produced little change in TA102+/-S9 compared to native ATX I. However, nitrosylated ATX I generated a potent direct-acting frameshift mutagen at C sites in TA97+/-S9. While ATX I was not mutagenic in either V79 cells or H4IIE cells, 5 and 10 microg/ml nitrosylated ATX I produced a doubling of 6-thioguanine resistant V79 colonies and 0.5 and 1 microg/ml were mutagenic to H4IIE cells, becoming toxic at higher concentrations.

The cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and intestinal anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. In addition, the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome P450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectrum. This was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. Our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-AF, 4-AB, and Bz into mutagens. The metabolic activation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme.

1298,"This paper reviews the influence of DNA repair on spontaneous and mutagen-induced mutation spectra at the base-substitution (hisG46) and -1 frameshift (hisD3052) alleles present in strains of the Salmonella (Ames) mutagenicity assay. At the frameshift allele (mostly a CGCGCGCG target), DeltauvrB influences the frequency of spontaneous hotspot mutations (-CG), duplications, and deletions, and it also shifts the sites of deletions and duplications. Cells with pKM101+DeltauvrB spontaneously produce complex frameshifts (frameshifts with an adjacent base substitution). The spontaneous frequency of 1-base insertions or concerted (templated) mutations is unaffected by DNA repair, and neither mutation is inducible by mutagens. Glu-P-1, 1-nitropyrene (1NP), and 2-acetylaminofluorene (2AAF) induce only hotspot mutations and are unaffected by pKM101, whereas benzo(a)pyrene and 4-aminobiphenyl induce only hotspot in pKM101(-), and hotspot plus complex in pKM101(+). At the base-substitution allele (mostly a CC/GG target), the DeltauvrB allele increases spontaneous transitions in the absence of pKM101 and increases transversions in its presence. The frequency of suppressor mutations is decreased 4x by DeltauvrB, but increased 7. 5x by pKM101. Both repair factors cause a shift in the proportion of mutations to the second position of the CC/GG target. With UV light and gamma-rays, the DeltauvrB allele increases the proportion of transitions relative to transversions. pKM101 is required for mutagenesis by Glu-P-1 and 4-AB, and the types and positions of the substitutions are not altered by the addition of the DeltauvrB allele. Changes in DNA repair appear to cause more changes in spontaneous than in mutagen-induced mutation spectra at both alleles. There is a high correlation (r(2)=0.8) between a mutagen's ability to induce complex frameshifts and its relative base-substitution/frameshift mutagenic potency. A mutagen induces the same primary class of base substitution in TA100 (DeltauvrB, pKM101) as it does in Escherichia coli, mammalian cells, or rodents as well as in the p53 gene of human tumors associated with exposure to that mutagen. Thus, a mutagen induces the same primary class of base substitution in most organisms, reflecting the conserved nature of DNA replication and repair processes.",Is 4-AB mutagenic for pKM101 or TA100 strain?,True

Quantifying and identifying the produced phytochemicals, and examining their protective effects against genotoxic agents, is of great interest. This study established a protocol for the qualitative and quantitative production of hepatoprotective compounds in cotyledon-derived  Silybum marianum  callus through optimized supplementation of the MS medium with the growth regulators 2,4-D, benzylaminopurine, myoinositol, and asparagine. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) allowed for identification and quantification of the produced compounds. None of the growth medium combinations supported a detectable production of silymarin. Instead, the generated calli accumulated phenolic acids, in particular chlorogenic acid and dicaffeoylquinic acid, as revealed by HPLC and mass spectrometric analysis. 4-Nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD) was employed in the AMES-test with  Salmonella typhimurium  strain TA98 because it is a potent mutagen for this strain. Results revealed that callus extract had a high anti-genotoxic activity with respect to standard silymarin but more evident with respect seed extract. The callus produced chlorogenic acid and dicaffeoylquinic acid, which revealed higher bioactivity than silymarin.

The genotoxicity of the extracted water samples was evaluated with the Ames Salmonella/mammalian microsome test, DNA repair-defective mutants, and bacteriophage lambda systems. The results of the Salmonella test demonstrated that the XAD-concentrated water samples had maximum mutagenicity with the TA98 strain both with and without metabolic activation. However, the liquid-liquid-extracted water samples were also found to be mutagenic with one or more of the Ames tester strains, but to a lesser extent as compared with XAD extracts. The damage brought about in the DNA repair-defective mutants in the presence of XAD-concentrated water samples was found to be markedly high as compared with that liquid-liquid-extracted water samples at the dose level of 20 microl/mL culture. All mutants invariably exhibited significant declines in their colony-forming units as compared with their isogenic wild-type counterparts. Survival decreased by 86.3 and 75.5% in the polA- strain after 6 h of treatment with XAD-concentrated and liquid-liquid-extracted water samples, respectively.

No mutagenicity was found in the CH2Cl2 extract using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA102, TA1537 and TA1538, with or without S9 metabolic activation. The pure compounds neither showed mutagenicity in TA 102 strain and the most important result was the strong reduction of mutagenic effect induced by hydrogen peroxide in S. typhimurium TA102, with or without S9, showed by the compounds 1 (more than 93%) and 4 (more than 88%) at 0.02 microg/plate.",Is acuminophenone A mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 or TA1537 strain?,False
1304,"It is a common practice in India to irrigate agricultural fields with wastewater originating from industries and domestic sources. At Jajmau (Kanpur), India, tannery effluent is used for irrigation purposes. This practice has been polluting the soil directly and groundwater and food crops indirectly. This study is aimed at evaluating the mutagenic impact of soil irrigated with tannery effluent. Soil extracts were prepared using four organic solvents (dichloromethane, methanol, acetonitrile, and acetone) and tested with Ames Salmonella/microsome test and DNA repair-defective E. coli k-12 mutants. Gas Chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis of soil samples revealed the presence of a large number of organic compounds including bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, benzene, 1,3-hexadien-5-yne, 2,4-bis(1,1-dimethyl)phenol, Docosane, 10-methylnonadecane, and many higher alkanes. The soil extracts exhibited significant mutagenicity with Ames tester strains. TA98 was found to be the most sensitive strains to all the soil extracts, producing maximum response in terms of mutagenic index of 14.2 (-S9) and 13.6 (+S9) in the presence of dichloromethane extract. Dichloromethane-extracted soil exhibited a maximum mutagenic potential of 17.3 (-S9) and 20.0 (+S9) revertants/mg soil equivalent in TA100. Methanol, acetonitrile, and acetone extracts were also found to be mutagenic. A significant decline in the survival of DNA repair-defective E. coli K-12 mutants was observed compared to their isogenic wild-type counterparts when treated with different soil extracts. PolA mutant was found to be the most sensitive strain toward all four soil extracts.",Is soil extracts mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

The methanol extracts from whole plants of Helichrysum simillimum, Helichrysum herbaceum and Helichrysum rugulosum indicated mutagenicity. These are the first reported tests on the mutagenicity of Helichrysum species. Six species indicated antimutagenic properties, all in the presence of S9: methanol leaf extract of Bauhinia galpinii, and dichloromethane leaf extracts of Bauhinia galpinii, Clerodendrum myricoides, Datura stramonium, Buddleja saligna, Millettia sutherlandii and Sutherlandia frutescens.",Is Helichrysum mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1306,"Samples of whole milk were heat treated by commercial heat-sterilization, by commercial heat-pasteurization or by a laboratory heat-pasteurization (65 degrees C for 30 min). Each sample was tested for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 with and without S-9 mix. Dichloromethane extracts of milk heated at 100, 135 and 150 degrees C for 5 hr were also tested for mutagenicity using the same assay. None of these samples exhibited mutagenicity in the Ames assay used.",Is milk mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1307,"Methylene chloride extracts of particulates from liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) combustion appliance were studied by using Ames test, micronucleus test and inducibility of pulmonary and hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in rats. The extracts showed mutagenicity for Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 and its derivatives TA98NR and TA98/1,8-DNP6 with or without S9 mix. The revertants in strains TA98NR and TA98/1,8-DNP6 were less than 40% and 50% of that in strain TA98 without S9 mix, respectively. Positive results were obtained in mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. Intratracheal instillation of the extracts led to increase in pulmonary (but not hepatic) AHH and GST activities in rats. It was seen that AHH was more sensitive than GST to induction by the extracts.",Is LPG mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1308,"Methylene chloride extracts of the browning reaction products prepared from model systems consisting of major milk components (casein and/or lactose, and non-fat dried milk) were tested for mutagenicity in the Ames Salmonella/microsome assay. Samples obtained by heating aqueous solutions of these components under either neutral or basic (pH 10) conditions exhibited no significant mutagenic activity when tested with or without S-9 mix. The addition of common food additives, such as sodium nitrite, butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene, to the aqueous solutions did not enhance the mutagenic activity of the browning samples. On the other hand, the tar samples prepared by heating the same milk components in the dry state exhibited strong mutagenicity, primarily to Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 and only with S-9 mix. A casein/lactose mixture and non-fat dried milk were also heated with baking soda in the dry state. The presence of the baking soda enhanced the mutagenicity of the browning products; the tar from the non-fat dried milk heated with baking soda was the most potently mutagenic of all the samples towards strain TA98 and also produced a positive response in strain TA100 in the presence of S-9 mix.",Is browning products mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1309,"DL-p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) and its derivatives were evaluated for genotoxic effects using Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis strains lacking various DNA-repair mechanisms in spottest and in suspension test. The mutagenic activity of studied compounds was determined by the Ames test. Reverse mutation test was performed with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537 without S9 mix. 0.02 M nitrosomethylurea (NMU) standard mutagen was used as a positive control. The results showed that the parent nonessential amino acid PCPA had no detectable genotoxic and mutagenic activities in bacteria. The methyl ester of this amino acid and its N-phenylacetyl derivative possessed weak genotoxicity. Meanwhile N-sec-butyloxycarbonyl, N-benzyloxycarbonyl, N-(p-nitrophenylacetyl) and N-(p-nitrophenoxyacetyl) derivatives of DL-p-chlorophenylalanine exhibited appreciable genotoxicity. Among the seven tested compounds only N-benzyloxycarbonyl and N-(p-nitrophenoxyacetyl) derivatives of DL-p-chlorophenylalanine have been found to be mutagenic. Only parent PCPA possessed antimutagenic properties in respect of nitrosomethylurea. The structural modification, which strongly affects genotoxicity and mutagenicity perhaps may be due to steric hydrance of the substituents, causing interference with enzyme and DNA interactions.",Is PCPA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
1310,"Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (Tris-CP) was metabolized to products which were mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium TA100 in the presence of liver microsomes from phenobarbital (PB)-pretreated rats and NADPH. Effects of various inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P-450 on Tris-CP mutagenicity were in accordance with PB-inducible forms of this enzyme system being responsible for the formation of mutagenic product(s). A comparison was made between the toxic potential of the two halogenated flame retardants Tris-CP and tris(2,3-dibromopropyl)phosphate (Tris-BP) in 5 in vitro tests. Tris-CP was much less potent than Tris-BP with respect to bacterial (Salmonella/microsome or Salmonella/hepatocyte assay) and mammalian (V79 cells) mutagenicity, as well as DNA repair synthesis in hepatocytes. On the other hand, Tris-CP and Tris-BP were both equally effective in transforming Syrian hamster embryo cells in vitro. Tris-CP was not nephrotoxic to rats after a single dose of 500 mg/kg intraperitoneally, whereas Tris-BP caused extensive tubular necrosis accompanied by elevated levels of plasma urea and creatinine.","Is Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate mutagenic for TA100 strain?",True
1311,"Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP) is an unstable organic peroxide used in the manufacture of acrylic resins, as a hardening agent for fiberglass-reinforced plastics, and as a curing agent for unsaturated polyester resins. It is commercially available as a 40% to 60% solution in dimethyl phthalate (DMP). Because exposure to MEKP is typically through dermal contact, 2-week and 13-week toxicity studies were conducted by topical application of MEKP in DMP (45:55 w/w) to the clipped dorsal region of male and female Fischer 344/N rats and mice. Animals were evaluated for histopathology and for reproductive endpoints. In vitro genetic toxicity studies of MEKP included assessments of mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium and in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells and analysis of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In addition, the peripheral blood of mice from the 13-week study was evaluated in the micronucleus assay. In the 2-week studies, groups of 5 animals of each species and sex were administered MEKP in DMP for 5 days per week at doses of 50.6, 101.3, 202.5, 405, and 810 mg/kg body weight per day for rats and 112.5, 225, 450, 900, and 1800 mg/kg body weight per day for mice. Control groups received DMP or no treatment. No rats died during the studies, but at least 1 mouse in each group receiving MEKP died. Body weight gains of rats decreased with increasing doses of MEKP; body weight gains of mice were not affected by treatment. The primary effects of topical administration of MEKP in both rats and mice were an extensive coagulative necrosis of the epidermis and dermis, variable degrees of inflammation of the adnexa, and epidermal regeneration and hyperplasia at the application site. Lesions considered secondary to the dermal lesions included increased hematopoiesis in the spleen in rats and mice and increased myeloid hyperplasia of the bone marrow in mice, primarily at the higher doses. Mice showed a marked, dose-related increase in liver weight. In the 13-week dermal studies, groups of 10 rats and 10 mice of each sex were administered MEKP in DMP for 5 days per week at doses of 1.07, 3.57, 10.7, 35.7, and 107 mg/rat and 0.357, 1.19, 3.57, 11.9, and 35.7 mg/mouse. All high-dose mice, 3 high-dose female rats, and 1 female mouse in the 11.9 mg/animal group died or were sacrificed during the first week of the studies. Skin lesions similar to those seen in the 2-week studies were judged of sufficient severity to warrant early termination of surviving rats and mice in the 2 highest dose groups. All rats and mice in the remaining dose groups survived to the end of the studies, and weight gains were generally lower with increasing doses of MEKP. Skin lesions at the application site for the remaining animals (rats and mice) in the 10.7 mg/rat and 3.57 mg/mouse dose groups involved a spectrum of necrosis, inflammation, and acanthosis (epidermal hyperplasia). Lesions in the lower dose groups were limited to acanthosis and hyperkeratosis in rats (1.07 and 3.57 mg/rat) and acanthosis in mice (0.357 and 1.19 mg/mouse). While splenic and bone marrow lesions similar to those described in the 2-week studies were seen in animals that died early in the 13-week studies and in the rats and mice that showed ulcerative or necrotic injury, no other systemic changes were noted in animals that did not show ulcerative skin lesions. In genetic toxicity studies, MEKP in DMP (45:55 w/w) was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA1537, or TA98, with or without S9activation. A positive response was obtained in the mouse lymphoma assay for induction of trifluorothymidine resistance in L5178Y cells without S9. In cytogenetic tests with Chinese hamster ovary cells, MEKP induced sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations, with and without S9. No increase in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes was observed in peripheral blood samples obtained from male and female mice at the termination of the 13-week toxicity study. In summary, topical administration of MEKP in DM of MEKP in DMP resulted in a spectrum of necrotic, inflammatory, and regenerative skin lesions limited to the application site. Histopathologic changes in the spleen and bone marrow were also seen in rats and mice with ulcerative skin lesions, and were considered a secondary response. A no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for histopathologic skin lesions could not be determined from these studies, as lesions were observed with administration of daily doses as low as 1.07 mg for rats and 0.357 mg for mice.

1312,"Although many studies have reported that nitroaromatics such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) have strong mutagenicity, the mechanism of mutagenic activity in these compounds has not yet been reported. We examined the mutagenicity versus reactivity and biodegradation by bacteria using TNT and its analogs (1,3,5-trinitrobenzene [TNB], 2,4,6-trinitroaniline [TNA], 2,4,6-trinitro-phenol [TNP], N,2,4,6-tetranitro-N-methyl-aniline [tetryl], 2,4-dinitrotoluene [24DNT], and 2,6-dinitrotoluene [26DNT]). Aromatic compounds harboring three nitro groups (except TNP) have high mutagenicity, judging from the results of the umu test using luminescent bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535/pTL210). Single-electron reduction potentials for these chemicals were -530, -555, -565, -575, -640, -674, and -764 mV for TNA, tetyl, TNT, TNB, 24DNT, 26DNT, and TNP, respectively, indicating that trinitro-aromatics (except TNP) were more reducible than other compounds. Pseudomonas sp. strain TM15, which was isolated from TNT-contaminated soils in the Yamada Green Zone, Kitakyushu City, Japan, could efficiently biotransform TNT, TNB, TNA, and tetryl; 24DNT, 26DNT, and TNP were less biodegradable. This strain converted all TNT analogs into reduction products; nitro groups were reduced to amino groups. We revealed that the mutagenicity of nitroaromatics correlate with reactivity and biodegradability. This finding may contribute to the elucidation of mutagenic expression of nitroaromatic compounds in organisms.",Is TNB mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
1313,"Past production and handling of munitions has resulted in soil contamination at various military facilities. Depending on the concentrations present, these soils pose both a reactivity and toxicity hazard and the potential for groundwater contamination. Many munitions-related chemicals have been examined for mutagenicity in the Ames test, but because the metabolites may be present in low environmental concentrations, a more sensitive method is needed to elucidate the associated mutagenicity. RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene), tetryl (N-methyl-N-2,4,6-tetranitroaniline), TNB (1,3,5-trinitrobenzene) and metabolites were examined for mutagenicity in a microsuspension modification of the Salmonella histidine reversion assay with and without metabolic activation. TNB and tetryl were positive in TA98 (32.5, 5.2revertants/nmole) and TA100 (7.4, 9.5revertants/nmole) without metabolic activation and were more potent than TNT (TA98, 0.3revertants/nmole; TA100, 2.4revertants/nmole). With the exception of the tetranitroazoxytoluene derivatives, TNT metabolites were less mutagenic than TNT. RDX and two metabolites were negative in both strains, however, hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitroso-1,3,5-triazine was positive in TA100 with and without S9. Microsuspension bioassay results tend to correlate well with published Ames test data, however, there are discrepancies among the published data sets and the microsuspension assay results.",Is TNB mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1314,"The mutagenicity and toxicity of energetic compounds such as 2,4, 6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNB), hexahydro-1,3, 5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3, 5,7-tetrazocine (HMX), and of amino/nitro derivatives of toluene were investigated in vitro. Mutagenicity was evaluated with the Salmonella fluctuation test (FT) and the V79 Chinese hamster lung cell mutagenicity assay. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using V79 and TK6 human lymphoblastic cells. For the TK6 and V79 assays, TNB and 2, 4,6-triaminotoluene were more toxic than TNT, whereas RDX and HMX were without effect at their maximal aqueous solubility limits. The primary TNT metabolites (2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene, 4-amino-2, 6-dinitrotoluene, 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene and 2, 6-diamino-4-nitrotoluene) were generally less cytotoxic than the parent compound. The FT results indicated that TNB, TNT and all the tested primary TNT metabolites were mutagenic. Except for the cases of 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene and 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene in the TA98 strain, addition of rat liver S9 resulted in either no effect, or decreased activity. None of the tested compounds were mutagenic for the V79 mammalian cells with or without S9 metabolic activation. Thus, the FT assay was more sensitive to the genotoxic effects of energetic compounds than was the V79 test, suggesting that the FT might be a better screening tool for the presence of these explosives. The lack of mutagenicity of pure substances for V79 cells under the conditions used in this study does not preclude that genotoxicity could actually exist in other mammalian cells. In view of earlier reports and this study, mutagenicity testing of environmental samples should be considered as part of the hazard assessment of sites contaminated by TNT and related products.",Is TNB mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1315,"A galactose- and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-specific lectin (Viscum album L. var. coloratum agglutinin, VCA), which is known for its anticancer activity, was isolated from mistletoe. In this study, we investigated the antimutagenic potentials of VCA by using the pre-incubation method of the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100) in the presence or absence of S9 mixture. Viscum album L. var. coloratum agglutinin was assessed for its antimutagenic properties against the mutagens 2-aminoanthracene (2AA) and furylfuramide (AF-2) for strain TA98, and sodium azide (NaN(3) ) and 2-aminoanthracene (2AA) for strain TA100. The concentrations used for this test compound were 100, 200 and 400 µg per plate.  Viscum album L. var. coloratum agglutinin showed moderate, but not negligible, protective effects regarding the antimutagenic properties against the direct-acting mutagens NaN(3) and AF-2. Furthermore, VCA was more effective in preventing the mutagenicity of the indirect-acting mutagen 2-AA (in the presence of S9) when tested with both TA98 and TA100. In conclusion, this report has shown broad ranging antimutagenic effects of VCA to numerous mutagens in TA98 and TA100 Salmonella typhimurium strains. Although the data presented here cannot be applied in vivo, they can support other antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic findings for VCA.",Is 2-AA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1316,"The beneficial effects of Acanthopanax divaricatus var. albeofructus (ADA) extracts have been assessed by mutagenic and anti-mutagenic activities by Ames test. Mutation of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98, TA 100, TA1535, TA1537, and Escherichia coli WP2 uvr A was assayed in duplicates by the procedure of Maron and Ames in the presence or absence of S9 mix. As a result, ADA extracts were not mutagenic for S. typhimurium strains TA 98, TA 100, TA1535, TA1537, and E. coli by the Ames assay. Anti-mutagenic activity was assayed by the Ames mutagenicity assay using histidine mutant of S. typhimurium strains TA 98 and TA 100, using the plate-incorporation method. 2-Aminoanthrancene (2-AA), 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (AF-2), and sodium azide (NaN(3)) were used as the mutagens. ADA extracts showed a strong anti-mutagenic activity against 2-AA-induced mutagenesis which requires liver-metabolizing enzymes, and the same extract exhibited inhibitory effects on AF-2 and NaN(3)-induced mutagenesis in the absence of liver-metabolizing enzymes. The data indicate that ADA extracts contain anti-mutagenic activities against typical mutagens. The anti-mutagenic property of ADA provides additional health supplemental value to the other claimed therapeutic properties of the plant.",Is 2-AA mutagenic for TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
1317,"beta-Ionone (BIO) is a degraded (C(13)) sesquiterpenoid compound found in a variety of edible and aromatic plants. BIO and other ionone derivatives have been used in fragrance products and as flavoring food additives. In this study we investigated the mutagenic and antimutagenic activities of BIO using the Salmonella/microsome assay. Mutagenicity was evaluated by two tests with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA98, TA97a and TA1535, without and with addition of S9 mixture. A first assay was performed by the plate incorporation procedure and a confirmation test by the pre-incubation method. In either test, no increase in the number of his(+) revertant colonies over the negative (solvent) control values was noted with any of the four tester strains thereby indicating that BIO was not genotoxic in the Salmonella assay. Antimutagenic activity was investigated by testing (by the plate incorporation method) different non-toxic doses of BIO against one or more non-toxic doses of direct-acting (sodium azide: SA, 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide: 4-NQNO, 2-nitrofluorene: 2-NF and nitro-o-phenylenediamine: NPD) as well as indirect-acting (cyclophosphamide: CP, benzo[a]pyrene: B[a]P, aflatoxin B1: AFB1, 2-aminoanthracene: 2-AA, and 2-aminofluorene: 2-AF) mutagens. BIO did not alter the effects of any direct-acting mutagen or B[a]P and 2-AF. Mutagenic effects of AFB1 and CP, however, were markedly and dose-dependently antagonized by BIO. It has been reported that, in the rat liver, activation of B[a]P and 2-AF depend on CYP1A1 activity, and that CYP2B subfamily is involved in the metabolic activation of CP and AFB1. It has also been described that BIO is a potent inhibitor of CYP2B1/2 and a weaker inhibitor of CYP1A1. Therefore, antagonism of CP-and AFB1-induced mutagenic effects by BIO could have been mediated-at least in part-by the inhibition of CYP2B enzymes.",Is 2-AA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
1318,"alpha-Bisabolol (BISA) is a sesquiterpene alcohol found in the oils of chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) and other plants. BISA has been widely used in dermatological and cosmetic formulations. This study was undertaken to investigate the mutagenicity and antimutagenicity of BISA in the Salmonella/microsome assay. Mutagenicity of BISA was evaluated with TA100, TA98, TA97a and TA1535 Salmonella typhimurium strains, without and with addition of S9 mixture. No increase in the number of his+ revertant colonies over the negative (solvent) control values was observed with any of the four tester strains. In the antimutagenicity assays, BISA was tested up to the highest nontoxic dose (i.e. 50 and 150 microg/plate, with and without S9 mix, respectively) against direct-acting (sodium azide, SA; 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, 4-NQNO; 2-nitrofluorene, 2-NF; and nitro-o-phenylenediamine, NPD) as well as indirect-acting (cyclophosphamide, CP; benzo[a]pyrene, B[a]P; aflatoxin B1, AFB1; 2-aminoanthracene, 2-AA; and 2-aminofluorene, 2-AF) mutagens. BISA did not alter mutagenic activity of SA and of NPD, and showed only a weak inhibitory effect on the mutagenicity induced by 4-NQNO and 2-NF. The mutagenic effects of AFB1, CP, B[a]P, 2-AA and 2-AF, on the other hand, were all markedly and dose-dependently reduced by BISA. It was also found that BISA inhibited pentoxyresorufin-o-depentylase (PROD, IC50 2.76 microM) and ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD, 33.67 microM), which are markers for cytochromes CYP2B1 and 1A1 in rat liver microsomes. Since CYP2B1 converts AFB1 and CP into mutagenic metabolites, and CYP1A1 activates B[a]P, 2-AA and 2-AF, results suggest that BISA-induced antimutagenicity could be mediated by an inhibitory effect on the metabolic activation of these promutagens.",Is 2-AA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
1319,"Saffron is harvested from the dried, dark red stigmas of Crocus sativus L. flowers. It is used as a spice for flavoring and coloring food and as a perfume. It is often used for treating several diseases. We assessed the antimutagenic, comutagenic and cytotoxic effects of saffron and its main ingredients using the Ames/Salmonella test system, two well known mutagens (BP, 2AA), the in vitro colony formation assay and four different cultured human normal (CCD-18Lu) and malignant (HeLa, A-204 and HepG2) cells. When only using the TA98 strain in the Ames/Salmonella test system, saffron showed non-mutagenic, as well as non-antimutagenic activity against BP-induced mutagenicity, and demonstrated a dose-dependent co-mutagenic effect on 2-AA-induced mutagenicity. The saffron component responsible for this unusual comutagenic effect was safranal. In the in vitro colony formation test system, saffron displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect only against human malignant cells. All isolated carotenoid ingredients of saffron demonstrated cytotoxic activity against in vitro tumor cells. Saffron crocin derivatives possessed a stronger inhibitory effect on tumor cell colony formation. Overall, these results suggest that saffron itself, as well as its carotenoid components might be used as potential cancer chemopreventive agents.",Is saffron mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1320,"Antimutagens from gaiyou (Artemisia argyi Levl. et Vant., Compositae) were examined. The methanol extract prepared from aerial parts of this plant strongly reduced the mutagenicity of 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), when Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was used in the presence of the rat liver microsomal fraction. The antimutagens were purified chromatographically while monitoring the antimutagenic activity against Trp-P-2 with a modified Ames test employing a plate method. This purification resulted in the isolation of four strong antimutagens, 5,7-dihydroxy-6,3',4'-trimethoxyflavone (eupatilin), 5, 7,4'-trihydroxy-6,3'-dimethoxyflavone (jaceosidin), 5,7, 4'-trihydroxyflavone (apigenin) and 5,7, 4'-trihydroxy-3'-methoxyflavone (chrysoeriol) from the methanol extract. These antimutagenic flavones exhibited strong antimutagenic activity against not only Trp-P-2 but also against other heterocyclic amines, such as 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4, 3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3, 8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-3-methyl-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (MeA(alpha)C) in S. typhimurium TA98. In contrast, they did not exhibit antimutagenic activity against benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO), 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 2-nitrofluorene (2-NF) or furylfuramide (AF-2) in S. typhimurium TA98, or B[a]P, 4-NQO, 2-NF, AF-2, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) or sodium azide (SA) in Salmonella typhimurium TA100, whereas they decreased the mutagenicity caused by aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) and 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA) in both of these tester strains. Regarding the structure-activity relationship, the tested flavones had distinct differences in the intensities of their antimutagenic activities according to the differences of their substitution patterns. Namely, the intensity of antimutagenic activities against Trp-P-2 decreased in the order of: 5,7,3',4'-tetrasubstituted flavones (IC(50): <0.1 mmol/plate), 5,7,4'-trisubstituted flavones (IC(50): 0.120-0.260 mmol/plate), 5,6,7,3',4'-pentasubstituted flavones (IC(50): 0.440-0. 772 mmol/plate). The four isolated flavones were also studied regarding their antimutagenic mechanisms with preincubation methods of the modified Ames test and emission spectroscopic analysis. The results suggested that all isolated flavones were desmutagens which directly inactivated Trp-P-2 or inhibited its metabolic activation.",Is flavones mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False

Mutagenic potential of static magnetic fields up to 5T (T:1T=10,000 G) was not detected by the bacterial mutagenicity test using four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537) and Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA either in the pre-incubation method or in the plate incorporation method. In the co-mutagenicity test, E. coli WP2 uvrA cells were treated with various chemical mutagens and were simultaneously exposed to a 2T or a 5T static magnetic field. Mutation rate in the exposed group was significantly higher than that in the non-exposed group when cells were treated with N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS), 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO), 2-amino-3-methyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) or 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (AF-2). The mutagenicity of 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA), 9-aminoacridine (9-AA), N4-aminocytidine and 2-acetoamidofluorene (2-AAF) was not affected by the magnetic field exposure. Possible mechanisms of the co-mutagenicity of magnetic fields are discussed.",Is 2-AA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
1322,"In the present study a new in vivo/in vitro animal model was used to study the ability and potency of musk ketone and musk xylene to induce liver specific oxygenases (in vivo) which are necessary of toxify different premutagens, pregenotoxicants and/or precarcinogens to the ultimate DNA damaging agents. Therefore, rats were pretreated with 10, 20 and 40 mg/d nitro musk (NMV) for 5 days by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Then the postmitochondrial fractions of the hepatocytes (S9M) were used to examine the metabolic potency for toxification of the pregenotoxicants benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA) using the SOS chromotest (in vitro). Furthermore, musk xylene, musk ketone, musk ambrette, musk moskene and musk tibetene were examined for their mutagenicity in the Salmonella/microsome assay using S. typhimurium TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102 and for their genotoxicity in the SOS chromotest using Escherichia coli PQ37 (sfiA::lacZ) in the presence and absence of an exogenous metabolizing system (S9 of PCB induced rats = S9A). Both musk ketone and musk xylene were identified als inducers of toxifying enzymes (oxygenases) in rat liver. Using the in vivo/in vitro model these isoenzyme inductions led to a metabolisation (toxification) of the pregenotoxicants benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and/or 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA) (cogenotoxicity). Using S9M fractions of rats which were i.p.-pretreated with 5 x 40 mg musk ketone the induction factor in the SOS chromotest was IFmax = 4.0 by using 1 nmole B[a]P and IFmax > 4.0 by using 20 nmole 2-AA. Thus, musk ketone seems to be a Cytochrome P450 1A1 and 1A2 isoenzyme inducer in mammals. On the other hand the S9M fractions of musk xylene pretreated rats showed only a toxification of 2-AA (IFmax = 3.0). Therefore, a synergistic effect of enzyme inducers, i.e. musk xylene and musk ketone, and pregenotoxicants, i.e. B[a]P and 2-AA, regarding DNS damaging effects was identified. Musk ambrette showed high mutagenicity in S. typhimurium TA100 (500 His(-)-revertants per mumole, +S9A). Unexpectedly, these DNA damaging effects were not caused by bacterial nitroreductases but by rat S9A metabolisation (!). SOS inducing DNA damages in E. coli PQ37 were not produced (IFmax < 1.5). On the basis of the results presented and under consideration of the concentrations of NMV, other cogenotoxicants and pregenotoxicants such as B[a]P and 2-AA in environmental samples and human tissues, a genotoxic risk for humans has to be assumed.",Is Musk ambrette mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True

CYP1A1 but not CYP1A2 was detected by Western blot analysis of lymphocytes from untreated rats and was induced in lymphocytes from rats treated with the known CYP1A inducers beta-naphthoflavone [CAS #6051-87-2] or 3-methylcholanthrene [CAS #56-49-5] (7.3-fold), cigarette smoke (2. 8-fold), and pyridine [CAS #108-86-1] (2.6-fold). CYP1A1 was also induced in lymphocytes from rats treated with the nonprototypic inducer dexamethasone (17.7-fold) or bromobenzene [CAS #108-86-1] (3. 9-fold). Lymphocyte homogenate from rats treated with the inducers also catalyzed NADPH-dependent bioactivation of benzo[a]pyrene [CAS #50-32-8] to mutagens. The benzo(a)pyrene mutagenicity was detected using Salmonella typhimurium TA100 in the Ames test, and correlated positively with lymphocyte CYP1A1 content. The data show that CYP1A1 is present in rat peripheral blood lymphocytes in vivo, and is inducible by prototypic, as well as nonprototypic, inducers of the enzyme.",Is benzo[a]pyrene mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1324,"Chloropicrin (CCl3NO2) is a major soil fumigant for control of fungi, insects and nematodes and may by formed by chlorination of drinking water. It is also a strong lacrimator and induces sister chromatid exchanges in cultured human lymphocytes. Mutagenicity assays of CCl3NO2 in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 establish that it is toxic but not mutagenic at 500 nmol/plate but becomes mutagenic but not toxic on addition of S9 (previous work) or 1-2 molar equivalents of glutathione (GSH) (this study). The preincubation assay is superior to the plate incorporation test giving 2-4-fold higher revertants/nmol. Using the preincubation assay with GSH at 5 mM (a biomimetic level) in the top agar gives linear dose-response relationships for CCl3NO2 and its dechlorination products CHCl2NO2 and CH2ClNO2 with 0.56, 0.56 and 1.8 revertants/nmol, respectively. The mutagenicity values for CHCl2NO2 and CH2ClNO2 are the same in the presence and the absence of GSH, which only improves the linearity at high levels by reducing toxicity to the bacteria. GSH activation of CCl3NO2 mutagenicity may be due to reductive dechlorination of the trichloro compound to the more active CHCl2NO2 and CH2ClNO2. Alternatively, the mutagenicity may result from an intermediate GSH conjugate such as GSCCl2NO2 or GSCHClNO2. In comparison, the mutagenicity of CH2Br2 and CH2I2 is affected little if any by addition of GSH and these dihalomethanes are much less active than the halonitromethane series. It therefore appears that CCl3NO2 is not mutagenic in the absence of activation and that the dechlorinated metabolites CHCl2NO2 and CH2ClNO2 are moderately potent bacterial mutagens, consistent with the possible genotoxicity of CCl3NO2 in mammals.",Is CCl3NO2 mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True

The hydrocarbons were weakly mutagenic and the 3,4-diols were more strongly so, but all required activation to express their mutagenic potential. All four diol-epoxides were much more potent mutagens, even in the absence of activation.

In this work, the Ames test was used to evaluate the mutagenic potential of the hydroalcoholic extract of O. duckei leaves and of yangambin. Using TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102 and TA1535 strains of Salmonella typhimurium, positive results were obtained only with the hydroalcoholic extract, with or without metabolic activation.

The pyrolyzates are potent mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines formed during cooking. Solution of these amines was mixed with aqueous suspension of bacterial cells or dietary fibers, and removal of these amines from the reaction mixture by centrifugation was defined as the binding. Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 were effectively bound to all gram-positive and some gram-negative bacterial cells, corn bran, apple pulp, and soy bean fiber. Binding of Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and cellulose was moderate, and to chitin and chitosan it was little. None but corn bran bound Glu-P-1 and Glu-P-2 effectively. Corn bran effectively bound all mutagens tested. The quantity of the binding of IQ, MeIQ, and MeIQx was dependent on the strain of bacteria and the kind of fiber. The mechanism of binding of Trp-P-2 to freeze-dried feces, Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC9018), and corn bran was investigated. The binding was pH dependent, occurred instantaneously, and was inhibited by the addition of metal salts. These results indicate that the binding was mostly due to a cation-exchange mechanism, but some irreversible binding of Trp-P-2 was observed, most notably to freeze-dried feces. The mutagenicity of Trp-P-2 for Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of S9 mix was inhibited by the addition of LC9018 or corn bran to the reaction mixture. The results indicate that bound Trp-P-2 did not cause mutation under the assay conditions.",Is Trp-P-1 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

In this study, the effect of a reduction of Trp-P-1 on intestinal absorption as a promising strategy was investigated. The data showed that when 20 mM Trp-P-1 cotransported with 10 mM of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), xanthan gum, or carrageenan, the absorption rate of Trp-P-1 was reduced by 31.5%, 49.5%, or 72.9% in MDCK-MDR1 cell monolayer, respectively; and 64.6%, 83.4%, or 64.1% in rat intestinal tissues, correspondingly. These 3 polysaccharides also reduced pharmacokinetic parameters, that is, C max  , AUC 0-t  , and AUC 0-∞  , after Trp-P-1 was given to rats intragastrically. However, gum arabic did not exhibit similar effects on Trp-P-1 absorption in vitro or in vivo. The Ames test showed that these 3 polysaccharides reduced Trp-P-1 mutagenicity to Salmonella typhimurium TA98, but gum arabic did not. Isothermal titration calorimetry assay indicated that Trp-P-1 interacted with these 3 polysaccharides. Thermodynamic study showed that the actual value of △H <0, but its absolute value greater than the corresponding value of T∆S, suggest a specific interaction between Trp-P-1 and these 3 polysaccharides, probably through the hydrogen bond and/or ion interaction. Reduction of Trp-P-1 intestinal absorption using food additives could be one of the strategies to suppress Trp-P-1-induced carcinogenesis in human.",Is Trp-P-1 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1330,"Inonotus obliquus is a mushroom commonly known as Chaga that is widely used in folk medicine in Siberia, North America, and North Europe. Here, we evaluated the antimutagenic and antioxidant capacities of subfractions of Inonotus obliquus extract. The ethyl acetate extract was separated by vacuum chromatography into three fractions, and the fraction bearing the highest antimutagenic activity was subsequently separated into four fractions by reversed phase (ODS-C18) column chromatography. The most antimutagenic fraction was then separated into two subfractions (subfractions 1 and 2) by normal phase silica gel column chromatography. Ames test analysis revealed that the subfractions were not mutagenic. At 50 μg/plate, subfractions 1 and 2 strongly inhibited the mutagenesis induced in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 by the directly acting mutagen MNNG (0.4 μg/plate) by 80.0% and 77.3%, respectively. They also inhibited 0.15 μg/plate 4NQO-induced mutagenesis in TA98 and TA100 by 52.6-62.0%. The mutagenesis in TA98 induced by the indirectly acting mutagens Trp-P-1 (0.15 μg/plate) and B(α)P (10 μg/plate) was reduced by 47.0-68.2% by the subfractions, while the mutagenesis in TA100 by Trp-P-1 and B(α)P was reduced by 70.5-87.2%. Subfraction 1 was more inhibitory than subfraction 2 with regard to the mutagenic effects of 4NQO, Trp-P-1, and B(α)P. Subfractions 1 and 2 also had a strong antioxidant activity against DPPH radicals and were identified by MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR analyses as 3β-hydroxy-lanosta-8, 24-dien-21-al and inotodiol, respectively.

VCP-IS-2Na was assayed with chemical mutagens, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (furylfuramide) and 4-nitroquinolin 1-oxide (4NQO), which do not require liver metabolizing enzymes. VCP-IS-2Na at a concentration of 0.40 micromol/ml suppressed 66.2%, 54.7% and 60.2% of the SOS-inducing activity on MNNG, furylfuramide, and 4NQO, and the 50% inhibitory dose value (ID(50)) was 0.12 micromol/ml, 0.26 micromol/ml, and 0.17 micromol/ml, respectively. In addition, VCP-IS-2Na was assayed with 2-aminoanthracene (2AA) and 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), which require liver metabolizing enzymes.

In order to prevent the initiation stage of carcinogenesis, it is meaningful to discover the functional components of edible plants. The objective of this research was to test the antimutagenicity of the functional components of several typical traditional herbs used in Japan. The traditional herbs, gennoshoko (Geranium nepalense var. thunbergii), yomogi (Artemisia vulgaris var. indica), senburi (Swertia japonica), iwa-tobacco (Conandron ramondioides), sarunokoshikake (Elfvingia applanata), kanzo (Glycyeehiza uralensis Fisch) and matatabi (Actinidia polygama) were examined by Ames mutagenesis assay test with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 against mutagens, Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2 and B(a)P.

The methanol extract was re-extracted with hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol, and water. The ethyl acetate fraction showed a suppressive effect. Suppressive compounds in the ethyl acetate fraction were isolated by silica gel column chromatography and identified as the flavonoids acacetin (1), apigenin (2), luteolin (3), and quercetin (4) by EI-MS, IR, and (1)H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Compounds 1-4 suppressed the furylfuramide-induced SOS response in the umu test. Compounds 1-4 suppressed 60.2, 75.7, 90.0, and 66.6% of the SOS-inducing activity at a concentration of 0.70 micromol/ml. The ID50 (50% inhibitory dose) values of 1-4 were 0.62, 0.55, 0.44, and 0.59 micromol/ml.

The isolated compounds suppressed the expression of the umu gene following the induction of SOS response in the Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 that have been treated with various mutagens. The suppressive compounds were mainly localized in the ethyl acetate extract fraction of the processed clove. This ethyl acetate fraction was further fractionated by silica gel column chromatography, which resulted in the purification and subsequent identification of the suppressive compounds. Electron impact mass spectrometry, IR, and (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy were then used to delineate the structures of the compounds that confer the observed antimutagenic activity.

In the present investigations, curcumin as well as its two natural analogues i.e., dmC and bdmC were found to be highly effective in suppressing genotoxicity of all the tested cooked food mutagens in a dose-dependent manner, in both the frame shift (TA98) as well as base pair mutation sensitive (TA100) strains of S. typhimurium. However, bdmC appeared to be a relatively less active antimutagen compared to C and dmC. More than 80% inhibition of mutagenicity was observed at 200 microg/plate in case of C and dmC in both TA98 and TA100 against all tested cooked food mutagens. Where as, bdmC showed 39-79% inhibition in TA100 and 60-80% inhibition in TA98, at a dose of 200 microg/plate. These findings warrant further biochemical, enzymatic and in vivo investigations in animal models as well as in humans to establish the chemoprotective effect of these agents against mutagenic heterocyclic amines found in cooked food.",Is Trp-P-1 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1339,"Hericium erinaceus is valuable in the diet and in medical treatment. It contains water-soluble polysaccharides that have been found to enhance immunity and which show anti-artificial pulmonary metastatic tumor effects. In this study, water and ethanol extracts of the mycelium and fruiting body of Hericium erinaceus were examined by the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 to screen for antimutagenic effects against 5 mutagens: AFB1, B[a]P, Glu-P-1, NQNO, and Trp-P-1. We found that both extracts have the strongest antimutagenic activity against Trp-P-1, followed by Glu-P-1, B[a]P-1, AFB1, and finally NQNO. In addition, the antimutagenicity of the extracts was produced in a concentration-dependent manner. At a concentration of 200 ppm, both extracts showed the highest inhibitory action. However, the linear correlation indicated that concentration-activity relationship was not significant (p > 0.05). In addition, extracts showed less antimutagenicity after heat treatment (p < 0.05). This suggests that the antimutagenicity of the extracts is heat-labile. The ethanol extract from mycelium or fruiting body had better antimutagenic effects than did the water extract (p < 0.05). Also, the extract from the fruiting body had better antimutagenic effects than did that from the mycelium.",Is Hericium erinaceus mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False

Heterocyclic amines were extracted from river water by the blue rayon hanging method, and analyzed by gas chromatography with a nitrogen-phosphorous detector (GC-NPD) and GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after conversion into their N-dimethylaminomethylene derivatives. Identity of IQ, Trp-P-1 and AalphaC in the river water was confirmed by GC-MS. The contents of IQ, Trp-P-1 and AalphaC were estimated by GC-NPD at 1.78+/-0.17, 0.14+/-0.02 and 0.44+/-0.02 ng/g blue rayon equivalent (n=3), respectively.

The methanol extract was re-extracted with hexane, dichloromethane, butanol, and water. A dichloromethane fraction showed a suppressive effect. Suppressive compounds against furylfuramide in the dichloromethane fraction were isolated by SiO(2) column chromatography and identified as 7,4'-di-O-methyleriodictyol (1), 7, 3',4'-tri-O-methyleriodictyol (2), and 3,7,4'-tri-O-methylkaempferol (3). In addition, three flavonoids, ombuine (4), pachypodol (5), and kumatakenin (6), were isolated and identified from the dichrolomethane fraction. Compounds 1 and 3 suppressed >50% of the SOS-inducing activity at <0.6 micromol/mL, and the ID(50) values of both compounds were 0.25 micromol/mL. Compound 2 showed a weakly suppressive effect (17%) at a concentration of 0.6 micromol/mL, and compounds 4-6 did not.

The methanol extract from C. aurantium was successively re-extracted with hexane, dichloromethane, butanol, and water. A dichloromethane fraction showed a suppressive effect. The suppressive compounds in the dichloromethane fraction were isolated by SiO(2) column chromatography and identified as tetra-O-methylscutellarein (1), sinensetin (2), and nobiletin (3) by EI-MS and (1)H- and (13)C NMR spectroscopy. These compounds suppressed the furylfuramide-induced SOS response in the umu test. Gene expression was suppressed 67%, 45%, and 25% at a concentration of 0.6 micromol/mL, respectively. The ID(50) value (50% inhibition dose) of compound 1 was 0. 19 micromol/mL. These compounds were assayed with other mutagens, 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), which requires liver metabolizing enzymes, activated Trp-P-1, and UV irradiation.

1343,"A bibenzyl compound that possesses antimutagenic activity was isolated from the storage stem of Dendrobium nobile. The isolated compound suppressed the expression of the umu gene following the induction of SOS response in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 that have been treated with various mutagens. The suppressive compound was mainly localized in the n-hexane extract fraction of the processed D. nobile. This n-hexane fraction was further fractionated by silica gel column chromatography, which resulted in the purification and subsequent identification of the suppressive compound. EI-MS and (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy were then used to delineate the structure of the compound that confers the observed antimutagenic activity. Comparison of the obtained spectrum with that found in the literature indicated that moscatilin is the secondary suppressive compound. When using 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (furylfuramide) as the mutagen, moscatilin suppressed 85% of the umu gene expression compared to the controls at <0.73 micromol/mL, with an ID(50) value of 0.41 micromol/mL. Additionally, moscatilin was tested for its ability to suppress the mutagenic activity of other well-known mutagens such as 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), UV irradiation, 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3b]indole (Trp-P-1), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), and aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)). With all of the aforementioned chemicals or treatments, moscatilin showed a dramatic reduction in their mutagenic potential. Interestingly, moscatilin almost completely suppressed (97%) the AFB(1)-induced SOS response at concentrations <0.73 micromol/mL, with an ID(50) of 0.08 micromol/mL. Finally, the antimutagenic activities of moscatilin against furylfuramide and Trp-P-1 were assayed by the Ames test using the S. typhimurium TA100 strain.

1345,"The antimutagenicity and fermentation pattern of three Bifidobacterium longum strains (B. longum, B. longum PS+, and B. longum PS-) in skim milk were studied. The increase in fermentation time significantly increased antimutagenicity with all strains tested against the mutagenicity of both 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido-[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) in an Ames-like test using streptomycin-dependent strain SD510 of Salmonella typhimurium TA98. Bifidobacterium longum PS+, a polysaccharide-producing strain, had a longer lag phase but showed the highest inhibition percentage against both mutagens tested. The viability of B. longum PS+ cells was not affected by the low pH of 4.1, probably owing to the protection offered by the polysaccharide produced. The antimutagenicity of the fermented milk against Trp-P-1 was dose dependent. The strains were also able to bind with different amino acid pyrolysates, and B. longum showed the highest binding. Acetone extracts of fermented skim milk dissolved in water showed less antimutagenicity than extracts dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide. The isolated crude polysaccharide from B. longum PS+ showed a dose-dependent inhibition of the mutagenicity of Trp-P-1. Thus, we conclude that the polysaccharide of B. longum PS+ can be used as an antimutagen.",Is B. longum mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False

1348,"The possible anticlastogenic activity and bio-antimutagenic mechanism of the cultured broth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 28 were examined using in in vivo and in vitro test systems. In the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA100 (SD-) and in the umu-test with S. typhimurium TA1535/psk1002, the cultured broth of S. cerevisiae 28 showed bio-antimutagenic activity against mutagenicity induced by 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ). The cultured broth also showed bio-antimutagenic activity towards reverse mutations induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in Escherichia coli B/r WP2 trp-, but not by UV radiation. It is clear that the cultured broth could inhibit base substitution mutations induced by mutagens. Using mitomycin C (MMC) as a mutagen, the micronucleus test (with bone marrow cells of mice) showed anticlastogenic action when the cultured broth was given orally to mice.

1349,"26 synthetic and naturally occurring heterocyclic amines were tested in the Salmonella/microsome assay (Ames test) using tester strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence of an Aroclor-induced rat-liver S9 fraction. 9 of the compounds were protein-pyrolysis products which had previously been shown to be mutagenic. Mutagenic potencies similar to previously reported values were demonstrated for these compounds with the exception that Trp-P-1 was only mutagenic in strain TA98 in our study, although it had previously been reported to be weakly mutagenic in strain TA100. 17 structurally diverse heterocyclic amines were synthesized and tested for mutagenicity. The structural diversity of these synthetic heterocyclic amines will enhance the sensitivity of future quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies by demonstrating the structural characteristics essential for mutagenicity.

1350,"The antimutagenic effects of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) prepared by heating three sugars (fructose, glucose and xylose) and four amino acids (arginine, glycine, lysine and tryptophan) at 100 degrees C for 10 hr was evaluated in the Salmonella/microsome assay. The highest extent of browning was found in the MRPs of sugars-lysine and xylose-amino acids. The MRPs of xylose-amino acids showed stronger antioxidative activity and reducing power than did the other combinations. No mutagenicity or toxicity in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was observed with any of the MRPs in the presence of S-9. Most MRPs, especially those of sugars-tryptophan and xylose-amino acids, strongly inhibited the mutagenicity of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoline (IQ), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyridol-(4,3-b)indole (Trp-P-1) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido(1,2-a:3',2'-d)imidazole (Glu-P-1) in the presence of S-9. However, the MRPs of fructose-glycine and fructose-arginine increased the mutagenicity of Trp-P-1. The antimutagenic effect of the MRPs was well correlated with their antioxidative activity and reducing power. The mutagenicity of benzo[a]pyrene was moderately inhibited by most MRPs, but was increased by the MRP of glucose-arginine. Aflatoxin B1 mutagenicity was increased greatly by all the MRPs except that of xylose-tryptophan. The findings suggested that MRPs might have a bifunctional property of co-mutagenicity and antimutagenicity in certain cases.",Is Trp-P-1 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1351,"Heterocyclic aromatic amines, derived from the pyrolysis of amino acids and proteins, are potent mutagens in the Ames Salmonella assay with rodent liver activation. Additionally, heterocyclic aromatic amines are multipotent carcinogens. We report evidence that these compounds are substrates for the hydroperoxidase activity of prostaglandin H synthase, as measured by alterations in UV/visible spectra, and are bioactivated to macromolecule-reactive species by this enzyme. Indirect electron paramagnetic resonance studies indicate that this activation may occur via a one-electron mechanism. 2-Amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) are direct-acting mutagens in TA98. The mutagenicity of IQ and MeIQ, but not Trp-P-2, were enhanced by activation with ram seminal vesicle microsomes (a rich source of prostaglandin H synthase). Subsequent experiments utilized the newly constructed tester strain TA1538/1,8-DNP6 (pYG 121), which has enhanced arylamine N-acetyltransferase activity. In this strain IQ, MeIQ and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido-[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1) were mutagenic with ram seminal vesicle microsome activation. 3-Amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) was a weak direct-acting mutagen, and was not activated by the ram seminal vesicles (RSV) system. The responses of IQ and MeIQ were markedly enhanced in TA1538/1.8-DNP6 (pYG 121), relative to TA98. These data are consistent with the involvement of prostaglandin H synthase-catalyzed activation in heterocyclic aromatic amine-induced extrahepatic neoplasia.",Is Trp-P-1 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

In the present study, we further examined the abilities of 151 chemicals to induce umu gene expression in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. Among the chemicals examined, 72 compounds induced umu gene expression, which could be defined on a basis of increased beta-galactosidase activity by 2-fold over the background level. The potent genotoxic compounds without metabolic activation were adriamycin, bleomycin, daunorubicin, 1,3-dinitropyrene, 1,6-dinitropyrene, 1,8-dinitropyrene, N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, furylfuramide, methyl methanesulfonate, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, mitomycin C, 1-nitropyrene and 4-nitroquino-line-1-oxide. In the presence of S9, aflatoxin B1, 2-aminoanthracene, Glu-P-1, IQ, MeIQ, MeIQx, Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 also induced umu gene expression markedly. Several chemicals such as 2-acetylaminofluorene, 9-aminoacridine, azobenzene, benzanthracene, benzidine, diethyl nitrosamine, 1-nitronaphthalene, paraquat, potassium dichromate and sodium nitrite were weakly genotoxic and the induction by these compounds could be detected only when the incubation time was prolonged from 2 h to 5 h. Data are also presented that some of the chemicals such as dimethyl sulfoxide, m-dioxan, 5-fluorouracil and paraquat, which have been reported to be non-mutagenic in Ames/Salmonella assay, were found to be active in inducing umu gene expression, while the known mutagenic compounds including acrylonitrile, 4,4'-dinitrobiphenyl, furfural, methylene chloride, 1-naphthylamine, sodium azide, o-tolidine and o-toluidine were non-genotoxic in the present assay system.",Is acrylonitrile mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,False

The pyrolyzates are potent mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines formed during cooking. Solution of these amines was mixed with aqueous suspension of bacterial cells or dietary fibers, and removal of these amines from the reaction mixture by centrifugation was defined as the binding. Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 were effectively bound to all gram-positive and some gram-negative bacterial cells, corn bran, apple pulp, and soy bean fiber. Binding of Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and cellulose was moderate, and to chitin and chitosan it was little. None but corn bran bound Glu-P-1 and Glu-P-2 effectively. Corn bran effectively bound all mutagens tested. The quantity of the binding of IQ, MeIQ, and MeIQx was dependent on the strain of bacteria and the kind of fiber. The mechanism of binding of Trp-P-2 to freeze-dried feces, Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC9018), and corn bran was investigated. The binding was pH dependent, occurred instantaneously, and was inhibited by the addition of metal salts. These results indicate that the binding was mostly due to a cation-exchange mechanism, but some irreversible binding of Trp-P-2 was observed, most notably to freeze-dried feces. The mutagenicity of Trp-P-2 for Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of S9 mix was inhibited by the addition of LC9018 or corn bran to the reaction mixture.

1355,"The formation of mutagens by amino-carbonyl reactions of 20 kinds of amino acid and sugars after heating at 100 degrees C for 10 h was examined by the Ames test. The browned solutions of Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Ser, Thr, Gln, Lys X HCl, Arg, Phe, Cys, Met and Pro with Glc caused mutation of Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and/or TA98 with or without S9 mix. The presence of S9 mix increased the mutagenic activity of the browned solutions of Cys and Phe with Glc on TA100 and of those of Gly, Ala, Val, Ile and Cys on TA98, but decreased the activity of other solutions. No revertants of Salmonella were induced by the browned solutions of Trp, Tyr, Asp, Asn, Glu and (Cys)2 with Glc. Among positive browned solutions, Cys, Lys, Arg and Phe had the stronger activity, but their activity was weak compared with that of pyrolysates or chemical mutagens such as Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2 and 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide.

Mutagenic activities of quercetin, pyrolysates of beef, salmon and sodium glutamate, and condensate of cigarette smoke were also decreased to some extent by saliva treatment, but no significant effect was found on the activity of MMS and pyrolysate of polypeptone. These effects showed individual variations. The inhibition of AF-2 mutagenicity by saliva varied with temperature in TA100 but not in TA98 cultures. Boiled saliva inactivated AF-2 mutagenicity in TA98 to some extent but not in TA100 cultures. Inactivation of AF-2 mutagenicity by saliva treatment was completed within 30 sec.

The TA7000 series of tester strains were TA7001, TA7002, TA7003, TA7004, TA7005 and TA7006, each of which reverts by a specific base substitution. In addition, each chemical was tested in a mixture of the base-specific strains (the Mix), plus the traditional strains, TA98 and TA1537. A liquid version of the Salmonella mutagenicity assay was performed in microtiter plates to allow partial automation for increased throughput. The results were compared to those in the National Toxicology Program (NTP) database, which were obtained from the traditional strains in the preincubation assay. In the two strains common to both protocols, TA98 and TA1537, the agreement was 80% and 85%, respectively. When compared to the NTP results for TA100, the Mix gave a 72% concordance, while the addition of the frameshift tester strain, TA98, increased the agreement to 76%. The overall agreement on positive or negative classifications of mutagenicity was 88% for the 25 chemicals tested. There were three notable exceptions to the overall agreement. Benzaldehyde was detected as a mutagen in TA7005 in contrast to its classification as a non-mutagen in the NTP database. This does not necessarily contradict the NTP results because the base-specific strains may respond to different mutagens. Two weak mutagens in the NTP database, 1-chloro-2-propanol and isobutyl nitrite, were not detected as mutagens in the base-specific new strains in the liquid protocol. While there are a number of major differences in the two assays, it was concluded that the results from each procedure are comparable.",Is Benzaldehyde mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,True
1358,"In order to explore structure-activity relationships, 4,4'-diaminoazobenzene and four structurally related azo dyes were tested for their ability to induce gene mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA100, TA1537, TA1538, and TA98. Only 4,4'-diaminoazobenzene and 4,4'-N(beta-hydroxyethylamino)azobenzene were found to be active in the two frameshift strains TA1538 and TA98. Further tests were performed in strain TA98, both in the presence and in the absence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat or hamster liver S9 preparations. The amount of S9 used per plate was 50, 100, 150 or 300 microliters, which corresponds to 10, 20, 30 or 60% of S9 in S9 mix. 4,4'-Diaminoazobenzene was found to be mutagenic, and its mutagenicity depended on the percentage of S9 in S9 mix and the type of S9 fraction used. 4,4'-N-(beta-Hydroxyethylamino)azobenzene was less mutagenic than 4,4'-diaminoazobenzene, indicating a reduction in mutagenicity associated with the beta-hydroxyalkyl substituents. The other three azo dyes [4'-methyl-4-N,N-di(beta-hydroxyethylamino) azobenzene; 4'-amino-6-methyl-4-N,N-di(beta-hydroxyethylamino)azobenzene; and 4'-N(beta-hydroxyethyl-amino)4-N,N-di(beta-hydroxyethylamino)azobe nzene] were inactive, both in the presence and in the absence of the metabolic activation system. The use of the preincubation test did not alter the observed positive or negative response of these compounds. The importance of this finding is that the non-mutagenicity or decreased mutagenicity of these four compounds is predictable on the basis of their chemical structures. These azo dyes, like the non-mutagenic members of series of monocyclic aromatic amines, contain large substituents on one or both of the amino groups of the parent compound, in this case 4,4'-diaminoazobenzene. From our earlier data and the experiments discussed in this paper, we conclude that the study of structure--activity relationships can provide useful information for the prediction and interpretation of mutagenic responses.","Is 4,4'-N-(beta-Hydroxyethylamino)azobenzene mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?",True
1359,"There is a growing consensus that e-cigarettes hold the potential for reducing the harm associated with cigarette smoking. Recently published studies have reported in vitro testing of e-cigarettes, demonstrating reduced toxicological and biological effects. Few studies however have reported the use of e-cigarettes under extreme testing conditions. To assess the full mutagenic potential of a commercially available electronic-cigarette (Vype ePen), this study investigated the delivery of aerosol under extreme conditions, using a scaled-down 35 mm plate Ames bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay. S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA97, TA104 and E. coli WP2 uvrA pKM101 with or without metabolic activation (S9), were employed. Using a modified Vitrocell VC 10 exposure system 0, 180, 360, 540, 720 or 900 puffs of undiluted e-cigarette aerosol was generated and delivered to bacterial cultures aligned to reported human consumption data. The results demonstrate that no mutagenic activity was observed in any strain under any test condition even when exposed to 900 puffs of undiluted e-cigarette aerosols +/- S9. Positive control responses were observed in all strains +/- S9. Nicotine assessments demonstrated an increased and consistent aerosol delivery, with calculated maximum doses of ∼1 mg/mL delivery of nicotine. These data demonstrate the validity of this unique testing approach and adds further information to the growing weight of evidence that e-cigarettes offer substantially reduced exposure when compared to conventional cigarette smoke. For future in vitro assessments of next generation tobacco and nicotine products, the generation, delivery and testing of undiluted aerosols can now be considered.",Is e-cigarettes mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or pKM101 strain?,False
1360,"Nicotine is a naturally occurring alkaloid found primarily in members of the solanaceous plant family, which includes tobacco. Nicotine is rapidly absorbed by humans and then metabolized, primarily by cytochrome P450's. Studies on the genotoxic potential of these metabolites are limited. Nicotine and four of its major metabolites: cotinine, nicotine-N'-oxide, cotinine-N-oxide, and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine were evaluated for genotoxic potential in the Salmonella mutagenicity assay (strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA1538) at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000 micrograms/plate and in the Chinese hamster ovary sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) assay at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000 micrograms/ml. All assays were conducted with and without S9 metabolic activation. None of the five compounds increased the frequency of mutations or the frequency of SCEs. These results indicate that nicotine and its major metabolites are not genotoxic in the assays conducted.",Is Nicotine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
1361,"TNT was mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium without the need of a rat liver metabolic activation system (S9). The mutagenic potency of TNT decreased in proportion to the number of nitro groups that were reduced to the amino form. The presence of a nitro group on the 4 position of the diamino congener is necessary for mutagenicity. Among the active congeners, mutagenicity was generally greater for TA100 than TA98, except that for the 4-amino congener the reverse was true. In cases when S9 was included in the assay, there was always a decrease in the number of mutants induced as compared with those without S9. Tetryl behaved like TNT, except that it was approximately three times more potent. RDX and HMX were not mutagenic under the conditions of the assay. When TNT was composed, the major metabolites identified in organic extracts of compost samples were the 2-amino and 4-amino congeners. An acetonitrile extract of compost was tested and found to be more mutagenic for TA98 than TA100, much like the authentic 4-amino congener, but the amount of this congener in the extract did not account for the degree of mutagenicity.",Is Tetryl mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1362,"Health concerns have arisen due to the formation of N-nitrosodibenzylamine (NDBzA; CAS No. 5336-53-8) in pork processed in a new type of rubber netting. In view of the potent carcinogenicity of related nitrosamines (e.g. N-nitroso-n-dibutylamine and N-nitrosodiethylamine), NDBzA was evaluated for genotoxicity in vitro in both Chinese hamster V79 cells and in Salmonella. In V79 cells, concentrations up to 25 micrograms/ml were tested with and without activation by rat or hamster hepatocytes. Significant elevation of SCE frequency was seen only at 25 micrograms/ml in the presence of uninduced hamster hepatocytes. Mutation to 6-thioguanine resistance was observed at 25 micrograms/ml, in the absence of hepatocytes and in the presence of induced (Aroclor 1254) or uninduced hamster hepatocytes, but not with rat hepatocytes. With uninduced rat hepatocytes, a small but significant (p less than 0.05) increase in the mutation frequency was seen with 10 micrograms/ml NDBzA. In the Salmonella assay, using a pre-incubation protocol and concentrations up to 1000 micrograms/ml, NDBzA was negative in strain TA98, and in TA100 with rat S9, but was positive at the highest dose in TA100 with hamster S9, and more strongly with Aroclor 1254-induced hamster S9. When activated by uninduced rat or hamster hepatocytes, as opposed to S9, NDBzA was negative with all tester strains. Hamster hepatocytes activated more than rat in the V79 studies, and hamster S9 was more strongly activating in the Salmonella assay. These results indicate that NDBzA is weakly mutagenic to both Salmonella and V79 cells.",Is NDBzA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1363,"Cyclohexanone oxime is used primarily as a captive intermediate in the synthesis of caprolactam for the production of polycaprolactam (Nylon-6) fibers and plastics and also in a variety of industrial applications. Cyclohexanone oxime was selected for study because of the potential for human exposure and the interest in oximes as a chemical class. Toxicity studies of cyclohexanone oxime (approximately 99% pure) were carried out in male and female B6C3F1 mice; the compound was administered in drinking water for 2 weeks or 13 weeks. In addition, the genetic toxicity of cyclohexanone oxime was evaluated by determining mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium and induction of chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells in vitro, with and without S9 activation. The frequency of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of mice from the 13-week study was also determined. In the 2-week study, groups of five male and five female mice were given drinking water containing 0, 106, 312, 625, 1,250, or 2,500 ppm cyclohexanone oxime. No deaths occurred, and there was no decrease in weight gain in any group. No gross lesions were observed; there were significant increases in relative spleen weights of males and females in the 2,500 ppm group and increases in the relative liver weight of male mice exposed to 312 ppm or greater. In the 13-week studies, groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were given drinking water containing 625, 1,250, 2,500, 5,000 or 10,000 ppm cyclohexanone oxime. Deaths occurred in the 10,000 ppm groups and weight gain was depressed in males and females given 10,000 ppm and in females given 5,000 ppm. There were significant increases in relative spleen weight at exposure levels of 5,000 and 10,000 ppm and significant increases in the relative liver weights of males and females that received 10,000 ppm. Microscopically, hematopoietic cell proliferation was observed in the spleen of males and females in the 5,000 and 10,000 ppm groups. Centrilobular cell hypertrophy was observed in the liver of males in the 2,500, 5,000, and 10,000 ppm groups and in females in the 5,000 and 10,000 ppm groups. Olfactory epithelial degeneration was observed in all exposed groups. Cyclohexanone oxime was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535 with S9 activation only; results of mutagenicity testing of cyclohexanone oxime were negative in strains TA97, TA98, and TA100, with and without S9. Cyclohexanone oxime gave equivocal results in a test for induction of chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells without S9; with S9, results were negative. In vivo, no induction of micronuclei was noted in erythrocytes of mice treated with cyclohexanone oxime either for 13 weeks in drinking water or for 3 days by intraperitoneal injection. In summary, the major targets of cyclohexanone oxime toxicity are the erythrocyte, spleen, liver, and nasal epithelium. The no-effect level for erythrotoxicity is 2,500 ppm following 13 weeks of exposure. The no-effect level for hematopoietic cell proliferation in the spleen is 2,500 ppm. The no-effect level for hepatotoxicity is 1,250 ppm for males and 2,500 ppm for females following 13 weeks of exposure. Some nasal olfactory epithelial degeneration was observed at all exposure levels; only at 625 ppm in males was the incidence of this lesion not significantly different from that in the controls.

1364,"Previously, Alternaria extract and metabolite mutagenicities+/-nitrosylation were characterized using Ames Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100, which are both reverted at GC sites. To examine other targets for mutation, the metabolites Altertoxin I (ATX I), Altenuene (ALT), Alternariol (AOH), Alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), Tentoxin (TENT), Tenuazonic acid (TA) and Radicinin (RAD) were reexamined+/-nitrosylation, using Ames Salmonella strain TA97, sensitive to frameshift mutations at a run of C's, as well as strains TA102 and TA104, reverted by base pair mutations at AT sites and more sensitive to oxidative damage. ATX I was also assessed for mammalian mutagenicity at the Hprt gene locus in Chinese hamster V79 lung fibroblasts and rat hepatoma H4IIE cells. When tested from 1 to 100 microg/plate without nitrosylation, ATX I was mutagenic in TA102+/-rat liver S9 for activation and weakly mutagenic in TA104+/-S9, demonstrating direct-acting AT base pair mutagenicity. AOH was also directly mutagenic at AT sites in TA102+/-S9 while AME was weakly mutagenic in TA102+/-S9 and TA104+S9. Nitrosylation of ATX I enhanced mutagenicity at AT sites in TA104+/-S9 but produced little change in TA102+/-S9 compared to native ATX I. However, nitrosylated ATX I generated a potent direct-acting frameshift mutagen at C sites in TA97+/-S9. While ATX I was not mutagenic in either V79 cells or H4IIE cells, 5 and 10 microg/ml nitrosylated ATX I produced a doubling of 6-thioguanine resistant V79 colonies and 0.5 and 1 microg/ml were mutagenic to H4IIE cells, becoming toxic at higher concentrations. These results suggest ATX I, AME and AOH induce mutations at AT sites, possibly through oxidative damage, with nitrosylation enhancing ATX I frameshift mutagenicity at runs of C's. Nitrosylated ATX I was also directly mutagenic in mammalian test systems.",Is AME mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1365,"Molds of the genus Alternaria are common food pathogens responsible for the spoilage of fruits, vegetables, grains, and nuts. Although consumption of Alternaria alternata-contaminated foodstuffs has been implicated in an elevated incidence of esophageal carcinogenesis, the mutagenic potencies of several A. alternata toxins seem unable to account for the levels of activity found using crude mycelial extracts. In this study, the mutagenic effects of nitrosylation were examined with the major Alternaria metabolites Altenuene (ALT), Alternariol (AOH), Alternariol Monomethyl Ether (AME), Altertoxin I (ATX I), Tentoxin (TENT), Tenuazonic Acid (TA), and Radicinin (RAD) using the Ames Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100. In the absence of nitrosylation, ATX I was mutagenic when tested from 1 to 100 microg/plate in TA98 with rat liver S9 for activation, while AOH and ATX I were weakly mutagenic +/- S9 in TA100. Incubation with nitrite generally increased mutagenic potencies with ATX I strongly mutagenic +/- S9 in both TA98 and TA100, while ALT, AOH, AME, and RAD responses were enhanced in TA100 + S9. However, subsequent examination of three extracts made from A. alternata culture broth, acetone-washed mycelia, and the acetone washes showed a different mutagenic response with both broth and acetone washes directly mutagenic in TA98 and TA100 but with a reduced response + S9. The acetone-washed mycelial extract was found to have the lowest mutagenic activity of the three extracts tested. Nitrosylation had little effect on the mutagenicity of any of the extracts. Thus, while nitrosylation increases the mutagenicity of ATX I, and to a lesser extent that of several other Alternaria toxins, the results demonstrate that Alternaria produces a major mutagenic activity with a S. typhimurium response different from that found with the purified toxins. Efforts are currently underway to chemically identify this mutagenic species. Published 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Is ATX I mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

The genus Tubastraea (Class Anthozoa, Order Scleractinia, Family Dendrophylliidae) is characterized as a hard coral without the presence of zooxanthellae. In species of this genus alkaloids derived from the compound aplysinopsin with pharmacological activity are known. In Brazil T. coccinea and T. tagusensis are characterized as non-indigenous and invasive and are currently found along the Brazilian coast, from Santa Catarina to Bahia states. This study aims to analyze the mutagenic, cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of methanolic and ethanolic extracts from T. coccinea and T. tagusensis collected in Ilha Grande Bay, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Bacterial reverse mutation assay on the standard strains TA97, TA98, TA100, TA102 and TA104, in vitro micronucleus formation test and colorimetric assays for cytotoxic signals on the cell lines HepG2 and RAW264.7 were used.

1367,"As various populations are rapidly becoming an aging society worldwide and interest in health issues has increased, demand for functional foods including herbal products has increased markedly to maintain a healthy state which has led to safety issues about their intake as an inevitable result. The objective of this study was to identify the safety profile of a Korean red ginseng and  Salvia plebeia  R. Br. extract mixture (KGC-03-PS) which is a valuable ingredient that can be used as a functional food. In the present study, the subacute oral toxicity and bacterial reverse mutagenicity of KGC-03-PS were evaluated. Sprague Dawley rats were administered KGC-03-PS orally for 28 days by gavage. Daily KGC-03-PS dose concentrations were 0, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day. Bacterial reverse mutation test with KGC-03-PS dose levels ranging from 312.5 to 5,000 μg/plate was carried out by OECD test guideline No. 471. Five bacterial strains ( Salmonella typhimurium  TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and  Escherichia coli  WP2) were tested in the presence or absence of metabolic activation by plate incorporation method. There were no toxicological effects related with test substance in the clinical evaluation of subacute oral toxicity test including clinical signs, body weight, and food consumption. Moreover, no toxicological changes related to KGC-03-PS were observed in the hematological and serum biochemical characteristics as well as in the pathological examinations, which included organ weight measurements and in the gross- or histopathological findings. KGC-03-PS did not induce an increase in the number of revertant colonies in all bacterial strains of the bacterial reverse mutation test. The no-observed-adverse-effect level of KGC-03-PS is greater than 2,000 mg/kg bw/day, and KGC-03-PS did not induce genotoxicity related to bacterial reverse mutations under the conditions used in this study.",Is KGC-03-PS mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False

Bacterial reverse mutation and chromosomal aberration tests, with or without metabolic activation, were performed. These tests showed no mutagenesis in the Ames assay or in Escherichia coli WP2uvrA, and no chromosomal aberrations in cultured fibroblast cells from Chinese hamster lungs (CHL/IU). Micronuclei were not induced in the reticulocytes of mouse peripheral blood following oral administration of GOS. In a 90-day repeated oral dose toxicity study in rats, GOS was administered at 0, 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. There were no GOS-related changes in clinical signs, body weight, water intake, feed intake, urinalysis, ophthalmology, haematology, blood chemistry, organ weights, gross pathology or histopathology in any of the treatment groups compared to the control group.

1369,"Tris(8-quinolinolato-N1, O8) aluminum (AlQ), an aluminum chelate of 8-hydroxyquinoline (8OHQ) is an important charge transfer molecule in semiconducting imaging devices. This study was conducted to evaluate AlQ and 8OHQ for the ability to induce reverse mutations, either in the presence or absence of mammalian microsomal enzymes, and to determine if AlQ decomposes or is metabolized to 8OHQ under assay conditions. The tester strains used in the mutation assay were Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537 and Escherichia coli WP2uvrA (pKM101). The assays were conducted in the presence and absence of S9. AlQ doses were 1-1000 microg per plate while 8OHQ doses were 0.947-947 microg per plate to maintain molar equivalency. Stability studies were carried out for 4h at 37 degrees C under conditions designed to mimic mutation assays. Samples were analyzed by HPLC and LC/MS to tentatively identify potential metabolites of AlQ and 8OHQ. The results of the bacterial mutagenicity assay indicate that in the presence of S9, both AlQ and 8OHQ, caused increases in the mean number of revertants per plate with tester strains TA100 and WP2uvrA (pKM101). No increases were observed with any of the remaining tester strain/activation condition combinations. The stability study showed that AlQ degrades readily to 8OHQ under standard mutagenicity test conditions, and the positive test result with AlQ is due to the bioactivation of 8OHQ. In the presence of S9, 8OHQ is metabolized to one detectable product with molecular weight indicative of a one-oxygen insertion. 8OHQ N-oxide and 2,8-quinolinediol were ruled out as possible metabolites; 8OHQ epoxides and other quinolinediols were neither confirmed nor ruled out. Bacterial mutagenicity tests have not been shown to predict in vivo effects of 8OHQ; these assays are similarly expected to be poorly predictive of in vivo genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of AlQ.",Is 8OHQ mutagenic for pKM101 or TA100 or TA1535 or WP2uvrA or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
1370,"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which are widely used as flame retardants, are considered persistent organic pollutants. To date, the available toxicological data on PBDEs are limited and were primarily obtained by studying technical blends. The present study was undertaken to investigate the genotoxicity of the pure congener 2,2',4,4',5-brominated diphenyl ether (BDE-99), one of the major isomers present in penta-commercial products. Bacterial reverse mutation assays in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 and in Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA, and the Allium cepa chromosome aberration test were carried out to evaluate mutagenicity and clastogenicity. The experimental design also involved testing a well-known polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture, Aroclor(R) 1254, which is structurally related to PBDEs. BDE-99 was negative in the bacterial mutagenicity assays, with and without S9 mix. Also, the frequency of structural chromosome aberrations was not significantly higher than the control and no signs of cytotoxicity were observed in BDE-99-treated A. cepa. Aroclor(R) 1254 was not mutagenic, but it induced a significant increase in chromosomal aberrations in A. cepa. In conclusion, BDE-99 was not mutagenic in S. typhimurium or E. coli, or clastogenic in A. cepa; however, the possibility that PBDEs might act through an epigenetic mechanism cannot be excluded.",Is BDE-99 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False

These are the two most commonly used nervous system stimulators throughout the world. TH is used in the long-term treatment of asthma. Bacterial mutagenicity assay showed very weak mutagenic effects of both drugs in Salmonella strains TA102 and TA104 only in certain concentrations when S9 was added to it. No mutagenic effects were observed in any other strains used in this assay either with or without metabolic activation.

1372,"1-Nitropyrene (1-NP) is a mutagenic nitro compound in the environment. We studied correlations between the mutagenicity of 1-NP for three strains of Salmonella typhimurium, the activity of bacterial nitroreductases and the amount of 1-NP-derived DNA adducts. Bacterial strains used in this study were S. typhimurium strains TA98, nitroreductase-less mutant TA98NR and YG1021 carrying a nitroreductase-producing plasmid. The mutagenicity of 1-NP was measured using the Ames assay, and the nitroreductase activities of these strains were assayed by quantification of 1-aminopyrene produced from 1-NP. The DNA adducts were measured by the 32P-postlabeling method. Among the three bacterial strains, strain YG1021 was the highest in mutagenicity of 1-NP, the nitroreductase activity and the DNA adduct level. However, S. typhimurium strain TA98NR had the lowest values of these three parameters. Nitroreductase activity, DNA adduct level and mutagenicity were strongly correlated with each other. These results indicate that bacterial nitroreductase plays an important role in forming the DNA adducts, and that the higher the adduct level the higher the level of mutagenicity.",Is 1-NP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1373,"In a previous report we described the ability of cyclohexanol to induce CYP activity. In order to characterize this induction we tested the capacity of liver S9 from rats orally treated with cyclohexanol for 5 days, to activate several carcinogenic nitrosamines into mutagens in the Salmonella typhimurium TA100 test system. Additionally, Western blot analysis of hepatic microsomes from the same treated animals were analysed with specific antibodies against P450 protein families 1A1/A2, 2B1/B2 and 2E1. Cyclohexanol-S9 mixture was more efficient in activating the following nitrosamines: N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodipropylamine (NDPA), N-nitrosomethylpropylamine (NMPA), N-nitrosodibutylamine (NDBA), and N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) into bacterial mutagens than S9 from non-treated animals. The mutagenicity of N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) was not modified in the presence of S9 from cyclohexanol-treated animals. Since the main metabolic pathway leading to the production of mutagenic intermediates of NDMA and NPYR is catalysed by isozyme CYP2E1 and that of NDPA, NMPA and NDBA by CYP2B1/B2, mutagenicity experiments predicted that cyclohexanol induces these two P450 isozyme families. Western blot analysis confirmed the results of the mutagenicity assay, showing an increase in the intensity of CYP2E1 and CYP2B1/B2 protein bands in hepatic microsomes from cyclohexanol treated rats in comparison with non-treated controls. Bacterial mutagenicity tests with specific pro-mutagens were good predictors of the P450 induction properties of cyclohexanol.",Is NDEA mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1374,"Mutagenic activity of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (2,4,6-TNT) and one of its derivatives, 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene (2,4-DA-6-NT) was studied in the Ames test using the Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, TA100NR (deficient in classical nitroreductases), and TA100/1, 8DNP (deficient in O-acetyltransferase). The number of revertants was significantly increased by 2,4,6-TNT, in comparison with that of spontaneous revertants. Base pair substitutions were preferentially induced by 2,4,6-TNT. The mutagenic effect of this compound was virtually altered by in vitro metabolic activation with the S9 fraction of human placenta. Neither 2,4,6-TNT nor 2,4-DA-6-NT exhibited mutagenic activity in the strains TA 100NR and TA 100/1,8DNP. Based on the results obtained, it is concluded that the mutagenic potential of 2,4,6-TNT is determined by its metabolites that form during bacterial metabolism. Bacterial nitroreductases and O-acetyltransferases are the key activators of this compound to form the ultimate mutagens.","Is 2,4-DA-6-NT mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?",True

In a modified Ames assay, mutagenicity is observed in S. typhimurium strain TA98 following the incubation of dichlorobenzidine, bacteria, and hydrogen peroxide. In this paper, we demonstrate that [14C]dichlorobenzidine becomes covalently bound to S. typhimurium macromolecules, including DNA, when exogenous hydrogen peroxide is supplied. We compared the levels of binding in a pair of otherwise isogenic strains with wild-type (oxyR+) versus constitutive (oxyR1) expression of the hydrogen peroxide stress-induced regulon. Binding was approximately twofold higher in TA4124 (oxyR1) than in TA4123 (oxyR+).

Bacterial 100,000 X g supernatants cleaved CTFEC, PCPC, CVC, PCPhC and SBC to pyruvate; pyruvate formation was inhibited by the beta-lyase inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) in all cases. Of the compounds tested, CEC, PCPC and CVC were mutagenic in the Ames-test. CTFEC, PCPhC and SBC failed to increase the number of revertants above control levels. The mutagenicity of PCPC and CVC could be inhibited by AOAA. CEC exerted a potent mutagenic effect in the Ames-test which was not affected by AOAA; CEC was not transformed to pyruvate by bacterial beta-lyase. Neither pyruvate formation nor mutagenicity were observed with SMC. These results indicate that the structure of the substituent on the sulfur atom is an important determinant for the biological activity of cysteine S-conjugates. Electronegative and/or unsaturated substituents are required for beta-lyase catalysed beta-elimination reactions. The formation of chemically unstable thiols, which may be converted to thioacylating intermediates, seems to be a prerequisite for beta-lyase dependent mutagenicity of S-conjugates.",Is PCPC mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1377,"The metabolism of beta-lyase and the mutagenicity of the synthetic cysteine conjugates S-1,2-dichlorovinylcysteine (DCVC), S-1,2,2-trichlorovinylcysteine (TCVC), S-1,2,3,4,4-pentachlorobuta-1,3-dienylcysteine (PCBC) and S-3-chloropropenylcysteine (CPC) were investigated in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA2638 and TA98. The bacteria contained significantly higher concentrations of beta-lyase than mammalian subcellular fractions. Bacterial 100,000 X g supernatants cleaved benzthiazolylcysteine to equimolar amounts of mercaptobenzthiazole and pyruvate. DCVC, TCVC and PCBC produced a linear time-dependent increase in pyruvate formation when incubated with bacterial 100,000 X g supernatants; pyruvate formation was inhibited by the beta-lyase inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA). CPC was not cleaved by bacterial enzymes to pyruvate. DCVC, TCVC and PCBC were mutagenic in three strains of S. typhimurium (TA100, TA2638 and TA98) in the Ames-test without addition of mammalian subcellular fractions; their mutagenicity was decreased by the addition of AOAA to the preincubation mixture. CPC was not mutagenic in any of the strains of bacteria tested. These results indicate that beta-lyase plays a key role in the metabolism and mutagenicity of haloalkenylcysteines when tested in S. typhimurium systems. The demonstrated formation in mammals of the mutagens DCVC, TCVC and PCBC during biotransformation of trichloroethylene (Tri), tetrachloroethylene (Tetra) and hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD) may provide a molecular explanation for the nephrocarcinogenicity of these compounds.",Is TCVC mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1378,"Telomerase-targeted strategies have aroused recent interest in anti-cancer chemotherapy, because DNA-binding drugs can interact with high-order tetraplex rather than double-stranded (duplex) DNA targets in tumour cells. However, the protracted cell-drug exposure times necessary for clinical application require that telomerase inhibitory efficacy must be accompanied by both low inherent cytotoxicity and the absence of mutagenicity/genotoxicity. For the first time, the genotoxicity of a number of structurally diverse DNA-interactive telomerase inhibitors is examined in the Ames test using six Salmonella typhimurium bacterial strains (TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98, TA100, and TA102). DNA damage induced by each agent was also assessed using the Comet assay with human lymphocytes. The two assay procedures revealed markedly different genotoxicity profiles that are likely to reflect differences in metabolism and/or DNA repair between bacterial and mammalian cells. The mutational spectrum for a biologically active fluorenone derivative, shown to be mutagenic in the TA100 strain, was characterised using a novel and rapid assay method based upon PCR amplification of a fragment of the hisG46 allele, followed by RFLP analysis. Preliminary analysis indicates that the majority (84%) of mutations induced by this compound are C --> A transversions at position 2 of the missense proline codon of the hisG46 allele. However, despite its genotoxic bacterial profile, this fluorenone agent gave a negative response in the Comet assay, and demonstrates how unwanted systemic effects (e.g., cytotoxicity and genotoxicity) can be prevented or ameliorated through suitable molecular fine-tuning of a candidate drug in targeted human tumour cells.",Is fluorenone derivative mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,True
1379,"Using an ion-exchange procedure coupled to a microsuspension Salmonella assay, we fractionated the dichloromethane-extractable particulate organics emitted by a municipal waste incinerator. Most (80-95%) of the mutagenic activity resided in the neutral/base fraction; however, the polar neutral fraction accounted for 12% of the direct-acting mutagenic activity. The mutagenic potencies of the whole extract and the various fractions were 4-15 times greater in the absence than in the presence of S9. Results with strains deficient in classical nitroreductase (TA98NR) and transacetylase (TA98/1,8-DNP6) indicated that a majority of the direct-acting mutagenicity was due to nitroarenes. This was confirmed by bioassay-directed subfractionation of the neutral/base faction by a cyanopropyl/HPLC method. The mutations in -3,000 revertants (approximately 400 each induced in TA98 by the whole extract, the neutral/base and polar neutral fractions from the ion-exchange column and 3 of the neural/base subfractions from the HPLC column; along with 200 revertants each induced by the model nitroarene 1-nitropyrene (1NP) in strains TA98, TA1538 and TA100) were analyzed by probe hybridization and PCR/DNA sequence analysis. The results indicated that nitroarenes such as 1NP that eluted in the neutral/base fraction accounted for at least 50% of the direct-acting mutagenicity and induced only a hotspot 2-base deletion in the sequence (CG)4 in TA98. In contrast, most of the complex frameshifts (a frameshift with a flanking base substitution) induced by the whole extract were induced by nitroarenes other than 1NP that were activated by transacetylation and that eluted in the polar neutral fraction. This study (1) identifies nitroarenes as an important contributor to the mutagenic activity of the emissions from municipal waste incinerators; (2) confirms our previous conclusion that the mutation spectrum of a complex mixture reflects the dominance of particular classes of chemical mutagens within the mixture; and (3) demonstrates the possibility of isolating certain chemical fractions of a complex mixture that induce certain classes of mutations produced by the whole, unfractionated mixture.",Is nitroarenes mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1380,"Glutaraldehyde (GA; CAS no. 111-30-8) has a wide spectrum of industrial, scientific and biomedical applications, with a potential for human exposure particularly in its biocidal applications. The likelihood for genotoxic effects was investigated in vitro and in vivo. A Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation assay showed no evidence for mutagenic activity with strains TA98, TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538, with or without metabolic activation. However, there was a weak mutagenic response (1.9-2.3-fold at the highest non-toxic concentration) with TA100 in the presence of metabolic activation. In a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) forward gene mutation assay (HGPRT locus) there were no consistent, statistically significant, reproducible or dosage-related increases in the frequency of 6-thioguanine resistant cells. There were no reproducible or dosage-related increases in sister chromatid exchanges in an in vitro test in CHO cells. An in vitro cytogenetics study in CHO cells showed no evidence for an increase in chromosomal aberrations on treatment with GA, either in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. In vivo, a mouse peripheral blood micronucleus test showed no increase in micronucleated polychromatophils at sampling times of 30, 48 and 72 h after acute gavage dosing with GA at 40, 80 and 125 mg kg(-1) (corresponding to 25, 50 and 85% of the LD(50)). The absence of an in vivo clastogenic potential was confirmed by no increase in chromosomal aberrations in a rat bone marrow cytogenetics study with sampling at 12, 24 and 48 h after acute gavage dosing with GA (12.5, 30 or 60 mg kg(-1) with males, and 7.5, 20 or 40 mg kg(-1) with females). Thus, in this series of tests, GA produced genotoxic effects in vitro only in a bacterial reverse mutation assay with no evidence for in vivo genotoxicity.",Is Glutaraldehyde mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
1381,"Aside from the considerable number of reports on the physical and chemical properties of dental bonding agents, information concerning their biologic effects is sparse. Three dentin bonding agents (Prisma Universal Bond, Pertac Universal Bond, and Syntac) and the ingredients methylmethacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate, and glutaraldehyde were investigated in the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity test system using five different bacterial strains (TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102, and TA104). The materials as well as the ingredients were eluted in both dimethyl sulfoxide and physiologic saline, and serially diluted eluates were used in the plate incorporation test. Pertac Universal Bond and Prisma Universal Bond did not elicit any mutagenic effects in any of the bacterial strains. In contrast, Syntac adhesive showed clear mutagenicity in S. typhimurium strain TA102. Dimethyl sulfoxide eluates, as well as physiologic saline eluates of the Syntac bonding agent, caused numbers of revertants that were about 6 times higher than control values. Reversion rates with other strains were moderately enhanced. Glutaraldehyde, an ingredient of Syntac adhesives, caused mutagenicity in a manner similar to Syntac adhesive eluates. Neither 2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate nor methylmethacrylate monomer was found to be mutagenic over a broad concentration range.",Is glutaraldehyde mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1382,"We investigated the photo-mutagenicity and photo-genotoxicity of N-dialkylnitrosamines and its mechanisms of UVA activation. With simultaneous irradiation of UVA, photo-mutagenicity of seven N-dialkylnitrosamines was observed in Ames bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium TA1535) in the absence of metabolic activation. Mutagenicity of pre-irradiated N-dialkylnitrosamines was also observed with S. typhimurium hisG46, TA100, TA102 and YG7108 in the absence of metabolic activation. UVA-mediated mutation with N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) decreased by adding either the NO or OH radical scavenger. When superhelical DNA was irradiated with N-dialkylnitrosamines, nicked circular DNA appeared. Ten N-dialkylnitrosamines examined produced strand breaks in the treated DNA in the presence of UVA. The level of single-strand breaks in phiX174 DNA mediated by N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) and UVA decreased by adding either a radical scavenger or superoxide dismutase. When calf thymus DNA was treated with N-dialkylnitrosamines (NDMA, NDEA, NMOR, N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) and N-nitrosopiperidine (NPIP)) and UVA, the ratio of 8-oxodG/dG in the DNA increased. Action spectra were obtained to determine if nitrosamine acts as a sensitizer of UVA. Both mutation frequency and NO formation were highest at the absorption maximum of nitrosamines, approximately 340 nm. The plots of NO formation and mutation frequency align with the absorption curve of NPYR, NMOR and NDMA. A significant linear correlation between the optical density of N-dialkynitrosamines at 340 nm and NO formation in each irradiated solution was revealed by ANOVA. We would like to propose the hypothesis that the N-nitroso moiety of N-dialkylnitrosamines absorbs UVA photons, UVA-photolysis of N-dialkylnitrosamines brings release of nitric oxide, and subsequent production of alkyl radical cations and active oxygen species follow as secondary events, which cause DNA strand breaks, oxidative and alkylative DNA damages and mutation.",Is N-dialkylnitrosamines mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 strain?,True
1383,"The aim of the current study was to evaluate the potential mutagenicity of aluminium oxide nanomaterials (NMs) (Al(2)O(3)-30 nm and Al(2)O(3)-40 nm). Characterization of the NMs was done before the initiation of the study. The mutagenicity of the NMs was studied by the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA100, TA1535, TA98, TA97a and TA102 strains, in the presence and absence of the S9 mixture. Based on a preliminary cytotoxicity study conducted on the strains, different concentrations of Al(2)O(3)-30 nm, Al(2)O(3)-40 nm and Al(2)O(3)-bulk were selected. At all the concentrations tested, Al(2)O(3)-30 nm and Al(2)O(3)-40 nm did not significantly increase the number of revertant colonies compared to the Al(2)O(3)-bulk and control with or without S9 mixture. Our findings suggest that Al(2)O(3) NMs were devoid of any size and concentration dependent mutagenicity compared to the Al(2)O(3)-bulk and control.",Is NMs mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 strain?,False
1384,"Phenylephrine hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine recommended for use as a nasal decongestant and as a mydriatic in ophthalmic applications. In 1977, total U.S. human exposure was estimated at 1.9 x 107 g per year. Phenylephrine hydrochloride was nominated for toxicology and carcinogenesis studies because of a lack of previous long-term studies and because two other sympathomimetic agents (soterenol hydrochloride and mesuprine hydrochloride) produced mesovarial leiomyomas in Sprague-Dawley rats. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of USP-grade phenylephrine hydrochloride were conducted by administering diets containing the chemical (99% pure) to F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex in studies of 14 days, 12 weeks, and 2 years. In the 14-day studies, no toxic effects were seen in rats or mice fed diets containing up to 2,000 ppm phenylephrine hydrochloride. Doses were increased in the 12-week studies, and deaths of male rats and male mice were observed in groups fed diets containing 10,000 or 20,000 ppm; 1/10 male rats in the 5,000-ppm group died. Other than inflammatory eye lesions (considered secondary to the pharmacologic drying action of the chemical), no specific organ toxicity was noted. Body weights decreased as concentrations of phenylephrine hydrochloride in the diet were increased, and feed consumption was lower in dosed rats. Doses of 0, 620, and 1,250 ppm for rats and 0, 1,250, and 2,500 ppm for mice were selected for the 2-year studies because of the decreased body weight gains in animals given higher doses in the 12-week studies. In the 2-year studies, the approximate amount of phenylephrine hydrochloride consumed per day was 24 mg/kg for low dose rats, 50 mg/kg for high dose rats, 133 mg/kg for low dose mice, and 270 mg/kg for high dose mice. Body weight differences in rats appeared to be dose related, and dosed animals were 3%-15% lighter than controls. Body weights of dosed mice averaged 3%-14% lower than those of controls throughout the 2-year studies. Survival of high dose male rats was greater than that of the controls (control, 30/50; low dose, 33/50; high dose, 42/50); differences in survival were not significant for female rats (42/50; 34/50; 36/50), male mice (35/50; 38/50; 43/50), or female mice (37/50; 34/50; 34/50). Few nonneoplastic lesions were related to phenylephrine hydrochloride dosing in rats or mice. Chronic focal inflammation of the liver was observed at increased incidences in dosed rats (male: 2/50; 13/50; 17/50; female:17/50; 28/50; 35/50). Inflammation of the prostate was seen more frequently in dosed than in control males (10/50; 24/50; 24/50). The incidence of focal cellular change in the liver was increased slightly in high dose male mice (0/50; 2/50; 7/50). In male rats, mononuclear cell leukemia (24/50; 9/50; 5/50) and pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland (14/49; 11/50; 2/50) occurred with negative trends, and the incidences in the high dose group were lower than those in the controls. No increases in neoplasia were seen in dosed male or female rats or mice. Phenylephrine hydrochloride was not mutagenic in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA98) with or without Aroclor 1254-induced liver S9 from male Sprague-Dawley rats or male Syrian hamsters. The results of mutagenicity studies of phenylephrine hydrochloride were equivocal in the mouse lymphoma L5178Y/TK+/- assay in the absence of S9; it was not tested in the presence of S9. Phenylephrine hydrochloride induced sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) but not chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The increase in SCEs was seen only in the absence of metabolic activation with S9. An audit of the experimental data was conducted for the 2-year studies of phenylephrine hydrochloride. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Under the conditions of these 2-year studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity of phenylephrine hydrochloride for male B6C3F1 mice given 1,250 or 2,500 ppm in feed. Survival of high dose male rats was greater than of high dose male rats was greater than that of controls, and the incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia and pheochromocytomas were lower in dosed than in control male rats. Inflammation was observed more frequently in the liver and prostate gland of dosed male rats than in controls.

1385,"Studies were performed to determine the direct mutagenicity of the acetates and some bromides and sulfates of hydroxymethyl polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. Benzylic acetates, bromides and sulfates were synthesized and characterized. The compounds tested were benzyl alcohol, 5-hydroxymethylchrysene, 1-hydroxymethylpyrene, 6-hydroxymethylbenzo[a]pyrene, 6-(2-hydroxyethyl)benzo[a]pyrene, 6-hydroxymethylanthanthrene, 9-hydroxymethylanthracene, 9-hydroxymethyl-10-methylanthracene, 7-hydroxymethylbenz[a]anthracene, 7-(2-hydroxyethyl)benz[a]anthracene, 12-hydroxymethylbenz[a]anthracene, 7-hydroxymethyl-12-methylbenz[a]anthracene, 12-hydroxymethyl-7-methylbenz[a]anthracene, 1-hydroxy-3-methylcholanthrene, 2-hydroxy-3-methylcholanthrene, 3-hydroxy-3, 4-dihydrocyclopental[cd]pyrene and 4-hydroxy-3, 4-dihydrocyclopental[cd]pyrene. The benzylic sulfate esters of 6-hydroxymethylbenzo[a]pyrene and 7-hydroxymethylbenz[a]anthracene were the most mutagenic compounds, whereas the aliphatic sulfate ester of 7-hydroxyethylbenz[a]anthracene did not cause an increase in mutations above background. All meso-anthracenic benzylic acetate esters were mutagenic in both strains with various degrees of activity, whereas the corresponding non-benzylic esters were inactive, as expected. Of the non-meso-benzylic acetate esters, only the 3-acetoxy-3, 4-dihydrocyclopenta[cd]pyrene was mutagenic. In the benzylic bromide series, only the eight mesoanthracenic were mutagenic, whereas benzyl bromide and 5-bromomethylchrysene were inactive. The aliphatic bromides, 6-(2-bromoethyl)benzo[a]pyrene and 7-(2-bromoethyl)benz[a]anthracene did not display significant activity. The potencies of the acetate esters more accurately reflect the mutagenicity because the rate of solvolysis did not compete with the reactivity of the esters with bacterial DNA. In the case of benzylic sulfates and bromides, the rate of solvolysis was very rapid and could have diminished the level of mutagenicity, depending on the assay conditions. These results demonstrate that meso-anthracenic benzylic acetates, sulfates and bromides are mutagenic, whereas benzylic acetate esters attached to other carbon atoms are inactive.",Is 7-hydroxymethylbenz[a]anthracene mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1386,"1-Hydroxymethylpyrene (HMP), a primary benzylic alcohol, and 4H-cyclopenta[def]chrysen-4-ol (OH-CPC), a secondary benzylic alcohol, were investigated for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium (reversion of the his- strain TA98) in the presence of various xenobiotic-metabolizing systems. In the direct test, HMP was inactive and OH-CPC was very weakly active. In the presence of NADPH-fortified postmitochondrial fraction from rat liver (S9/NADPH), no activation of OH-CPC was observed, whereas strong mutagenic effects were elicited by HMP. In the presence of cytosol and 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), both alcohols were activated to potent mutagens. For equal mutagenic effects, approximately 650-fold lower concentrations of HMP were required in the cytosol/PAPS-mediated assay than in the S9/NADPH-mediated assay. The cytosol/PAPS-mediated mutagenicity of both alcohols was 3- to 4-fold enhanced, when KCl (125 mM) was present during the exposure. The authentic chloromethylarenes, 1-chloromethylpyrene and 4-chloro-4H-cyclopenta[def]chrysene, showed very strong direct mutagenicity. These results, taken together with previous findings, indicate that both primary and secondary benzylic alcohols derived from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may be activated by sulfotransferases to electrophilic sulfuric acid esters, and by subsequent substitution reaction to further active species such as benzylic chlorides.",Is HMP mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1387,"Molds of the genus Alternaria are common food pathogens responsible for the spoilage of fruits, vegetables, grains, and nuts. Although consumption of Alternaria alternata-contaminated foodstuffs has been implicated in an elevated incidence of esophageal carcinogenesis, the mutagenic potencies of several A. alternata toxins seem unable to account for the levels of activity found using crude mycelial extracts. In this study, the mutagenic effects of nitrosylation were examined with the major Alternaria metabolites Altenuene (ALT), Alternariol (AOH), Alternariol Monomethyl Ether (AME), Altertoxin I (ATX I), Tentoxin (TENT), Tenuazonic Acid (TA), and Radicinin (RAD) using the Ames Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100. In the absence of nitrosylation, ATX I was mutagenic when tested from 1 to 100 microg/plate in TA98 with rat liver S9 for activation, while AOH and ATX I were weakly mutagenic +/- S9 in TA100. Incubation with nitrite generally increased mutagenic potencies with ATX I strongly mutagenic +/- S9 in both TA98 and TA100, while ALT, AOH, AME, and RAD responses were enhanced in TA100 + S9. However, subsequent examination of three extracts made from A. alternata culture broth, acetone-washed mycelia, and the acetone washes showed a different mutagenic response with both broth and acetone washes directly mutagenic in TA98 and TA100 but with a reduced response + S9. The acetone-washed mycelial extract was found to have the lowest mutagenic activity of the three extracts tested. Nitrosylation had little effect on the mutagenicity of any of the extracts. Thus, while nitrosylation increases the mutagenicity of ATX I, and to a lesser extent that of several other Alternaria toxins, the results demonstrate that Alternaria produces a major mutagenic activity with a S. typhimurium response different from that found with the purified toxins. Efforts are currently underway to chemically identify this mutagenic species. Published 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Is RAD mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

1389,"(N-[2-(Dimethylamino)ethyl]acridine-4-carboxamide (acridine carboxamide; NSC 601316) is an acridine-derived experimental antitumour agent with curative properties against Lewis lung carcinoma in mice. Although it intercalates into DNA and also appears to interact with topoisomerase II, its DNA binding properties appear distinct from other acridine derivatives such as the clinical antitumour drug, amsacrine. The mutagenic properties of acridine carboxamide, together with three related compounds containing either 9-aminoacridine or phenazine chromophores, were studied at the 6-thioguanine and ouabain loci in cultured V79 Chinese hamster fibroblasts. Each compound, when tested at concentrations causing up to 90% kill, had weak but significant activity at the 6-thioguanine but not at the ouabain locus. All drugs were potent inducers of micronuclei, indicating high clastogenic activity. There was a highly significant relationship between mutation frequency (as resistance to 6-thioguanine) and either cytotoxicity (measured as D37 in a clastogenicity assay) or clastogenicity. A broader range of compounds was also tested for microbial mutagenicity. In Salmonella typhimurium strains, none were mutagenic in TA98, TA100 or TA102 but several were mutagenic in TA1537, a frameshift tester strain. Some drugs also caused 'petite' mutagenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In general, compounds with the phenazine chromophore, which has no positive charge, were the most mutagenic in these systems. However, activity was not related to mammalian mutagenicity or antitumour effect. The results suggest that in mammalian cells, the cytotoxicity, clastogenicity and mutagenic activity of these drugs are mediated by similar mechanisms to those for amsacrine analogues, probably involving the enzyme DNA topoisomerase II.",Is acridine carboxamide mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 or TA1537 strain?,True
1390,"Since the herbicide propanil (3,4-dichloropropionanilide) is an aromatic amide and many other aromatic amides are genotoxic via N-hydroxy (N-OH) metabolites, N-oxidized derivatives of propanil and 3,4-dichloroaniline were synthesized and tested for genotoxicity. Propanil 3,4-dichloroaniline, and their N-OH derivatives were not mutagenic in the Salmonella typhimurium reversion assay using tester strains TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA104, in both the presence and absence of exogenous metabolic activation (S9). In addition, the test compounds were not mutagenic in the Chinese hamster ovary/hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (CHO/HGPRT) assay, in both the presence and absence of S9. 3,3',4,4'-Tetrachloroazobenzene (TCAB) and its azoxy derivative (TCAOB), which are synthetic contaminants and/or degradation products of propanil, were also inactive in the S. typhimurium reversion and CHO/HGPRT assays (+/- S9). Unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assays were performed to determine if propanil derivatives were able to induce DNA damage in primary rat hepatocytes. Although TCAB was the only derivative tested which induced an elevation in DNA repair, the extent was not statistically significant. Hepatocyte toxicity, as measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase 24 hr after exposure, was induced by all the test compounds in a concentration-dependent manner. Incubations of [14C]N-OH-3,4-dichloroaniline with DNA in vitro resulted in only a low level of binding that was not affected by pH. This observation may partially explained the lack of mutagenicity observed in genotoxicity assays with propanil derivatives.",Is Propanil mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1391,"Changes in environmental conditions in aquatic ecosystems caused by anthropic actions can modify the composition of primary producers, promoting the excessive proliferation of cyanobacteria. These organisms can form cyanobacterial blooms, which directly affect aquatic life. The present study investigated the mutagenicity of the cyanobacterium Sphaerospermopsis torques-reginae (strain ITEP-024), guanitoxin-producing (natural organophosphate), and sublethal effects on fish in relevant environment concentrations. For this, the Ames test (Salmonella/microsome) was performed as a mutagenic assay for extracts of the ITEP-024 strain. Specimens of Oreochromis niloticus (Teleostei: Cichlidae) were subjected to acute 96 h exposure to different concentrations of aqueous extract of the strain: C = control group; T1 = 31.25 mg/L; T2 = 62.5 mg/L; T3 = 125 mg/L; and T4 = 250 mg/L. Genotoxic, biochemical, osmoregulatory, and physiologic biomarkers were analyzed. Our results showed that the cyanobacterium had a weak mutagenic response for the TA102 strain of Salmonella with and without metabolic activation by S9. Strains TA98 and TA100 were not affected. Fish from treatments T3 and T4 showed changes in oxidative stress (CAT, SOD, and GST enzymes), inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase activity, micronucleus formation, and osmoregulatory disorders. No guanitoxin accumulation was detected in the different tissues of O. niloticus by LC-MS/MS. Our results showed unprecedented mutagenicity data of the guanitoxin-producing cyanobacteria by the Ames test and biochemical, osmoregulatory, and genotoxic disorders in fish, providing efficient aquatic contamination biomarkers. Despite the great concern related to the presence of guanitoxin in blooms in freshwater ecosystems, its concentration is not yet regulated, and thus there is no monitoring agenda in current legislation.",Is cyanobacterium mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1392,"Pyranocoumarins are compounds with an important pharmacological profile, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cytotoxic, antiviral, antibacterial, and hypoglycemic effects. These molecules have a widespread presence as secondary metabolites in medicinal plants used to treat Diabetes Mellitus (DM). The aim of this work was to evaluate antidiabetic activity in Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and the antioxidant effects of 3',4'-Di-O-acetyl-cis-khellactone (DOAcK), as well as its toxic potential. We obtained DOAcK with an enantiomeric excess of 70% by chemical synthesis. Our results showed that this compound exerts an important antidiabetic effect: blood glucose decreased in groups treated with DOAcK by 60.9% at dose of 15mg/kg (p<0.05) compared with the diabetic control group, and demonstrated a statistically significant increase in weight gain (45.7±9.7 in the group treated with DOAcK vs. -23.0±33.1 in the group with diabetes). In a biochemical profile, DOAcK did not modify lipid metabolism and did not cause damage at the renal level. DOAcK administration increased the activities of Catalase (CAT), Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), and Super Oxide Dismutase (SOD) to levels near those of the healthy group. Histopathological analysis exhibited morphology similar to that of the healthy group and the group treated with DOAcK. DOAcK is not mutagenic by Ames test for Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, or TA102, and is not genotoxic by Micronucleus assay; median lethal dose (LD50) >2000mg/kg and, at this dose, no signs of toxicity or death were reported after 14days of observation. These results indicate that DOAcK can improve glucose metabolism, which may be due to the increased antioxidant activity of CAT, GPx and SOD.

Mutagenic effects of QT and TF were evaluated using Salmonella typhimurium TA102 and Escherichia coli WP-2 uvrA tester strains. Either in the presence or absence of S9 mix, QT was mutagenic to TA102 and WP2 uvrA. However, the mutagenicity of QT was significantly enhanced in the presence of S9 mix. Likewise, in the presence of Iron (Fe2+) and NADPH generating system (NGS) and absence of S9 mix, QT induced significantly high mutations in both TA102 and WP-2 uvrA. Mutagenicity of QT decreased in both strains in the presence of Iron (Fe2+) or NGS alone. TF was not mutagenic in the presence or absence of S9 mix in both TA102 and WP-2 uvrA 2, regardless of the presence of iron or NGS. Incorporation of antioxidants (ascorbate, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT)) and/or iron chelators (desferroxamine (DF) and ethylenediamine-tetraacetate (EDTA)) in the test systems markedly decreased QT-induced mutations in both tester strains. These results suggest that QT but not TF, could induce mutations in the presence or absence of rat liver S9 or Iron (Fe2+) and NGS in both tester strains by redox cycling and Fenton reactions to produce oxygen free radicals. Our results indicate that a minor structural variation between the two plant polyphenols could elicit a marked difference in their genotoxicities. These results provide a basis for further study into the potential use of QT in combination with iron supplements.",Is QT mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True
1394,"The antimutagenic activity of the methanolic extract of the fruiting bodies of Ganoderma lucidum (Fr.) P. Krast. occurring in South India was investigated. The activity was assayed by Ames Salmonella mutagenicity test using histidine mutants of Salmonella typhimurium tester strains, TA98, TA100 and TA102. The methanolic extract of the mushroom significantly inhibited (P<0.001) the in vitro sodium azide (NaN(3)), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPD), and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) induced his(+) revertants in a dose dependent manner. In vivo antimutagenic activity of extract was also assayed by determining the mutagenicity of the urine of rats administrated with B[a]P as a mutagen. The prior administration of extract markedly inhibited mutagenicity induced by B[a]P. The results indicated that the methanolic extract of Ganoderma lucidum occurring in South India possessed significant antimutagenic activity. The effect of B[a]P on hepatic enzymes, such as serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and alkaline phosphtase (ALP), were also evaluated. The extract prevented the increase of SGOT, SGPT, and ALP activities consequent to B[a]P challenge, and enhanced the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). The extract also profoundly inhibited lipid peroxidation induced by B[a]P. The results revealed that Ganoderma lucidum extract restored antioxidant defense and prevented hepatic damage consequent to the challenge by B[a]P.",Is Ganoderma lucidum mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
1395,"1,3-Dithiane and 1,4-dithiane are the sulfur-containing Maillard reaction products (MRPs) which have been found in boiled beef extracts. In this study the genotoxicity of these products was examined using the Salmonella/microsomal test and the CHO/SCE assay. 1,3-Dithiane showed a potent direct-acting mutagenicity toward S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100, but 1,4-dithiane had a lower mutagenicity toward both tester strains. Both compounds were shown to be non-mutagenic with hepatic metabolic activation with the exception of 1,3-dithiane toward strain TA100. To compare the mutagenic potential of 1,3-dithiane and 1,4-dithiane with other types of MRPs, 24 MRPs were examined for their mutagenicity to S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100 in the presence or absence of S9 mix. 2,6-Dimethylpyrazine, furan, 2-acetylpyrrole, and thiazole were shown to be mutagenic. However, these four MRPs exhibited a lower mutagenicity in TA98 than 1,3-dithiane and 1,4-dithiane. Furthermore, SCE frequencies in CHO cells were very significantly induced by 1,3-dithiane in the absence of S9 mix, but the SCE-inducing capability of 1,3-dithiane was reduced or even disappeared with metabolic activation. 1,4-Dithiane did not significantly induce SCE frequencies in the presence or absence of S9 mix. Thus, we concluded that 1,3-dithiane was a potent mutagenic MRP in the Salmonella/microsomal test, whereas it was a weak SCE inducer in the CHO/SCE assay.","Is 1,3-Dithiane mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?",True
1396,"Variation in the formation and disposition of the hydroxylamine of (SMX-HA) is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of sulfamethoxazole (SMX)-induced idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions. We hypothesized that, in analogy to carcinogenic arylamines, SMX-HA might be further converted to an electrophilic N-acetoxy metabolite which could play a role in mediating SMX toxicity. Accordingly, we chemically synthesized N-acetoxy-SMX, and examined the characteristics of its formation, metabolism, cytotoxicity and mutagenicity in human and bacterial test systems. The human arylamine N-acetyl-transferases, (NAT)1 and NAT2, were capable of converting SMX-HA to N-acetoxy-SMX. NAT1 and NAT2 possessed similar affinities for SMX-HA (apparent Km values of 650 and 520 microM, respectively), but the apparent maximal velocity of the NAT1-mediated acetylation was higher than that of NAT2. (1332 vs. 37 nmol/min/U of immunoreactive NAT protein). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells 12,000 x g supernatant fractions converted N-acetoxy-SMX mainly back to SMX-HA, and also to a lesser extent to SMX, at clinically relevant concentrations. Similar pathways were observed in human hepatic cytosolic fractions. In a cytotoxicity assay, N-acetoxy-SMX was significantly more toxic to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells than SMX-HA (16.6 vs. 11.5% dead cells at a concentration of 300 microM). N-acetoxy-SMX was weakly mutagenic to the Salmonella typhimurium TA100 strain in the Ames test. These data suggest that the N-acetoxy metabolites of sulfonamides could potentially play a role in mediating sulfonamide idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions.",Is N-acetoxy-SMX mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1397,"Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a close association between infection with Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) and the development of gastric carcinoma. Chronic H.pylori infection increases the frequency of mutation in gastric epithelial cells. However, the mechanism by which infection of H.pylori leads to mutation in gastric epithelial cells is unclear. We suspected that components in H.pylori may be related to the mutagenic response associated with DNA alkylation, and could be detected with the Ames test using a more sensitive strain for alkylating agents. Our investigation revealed that an extract of H.pylori was mutagenic in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium YG7108, which is deficient in the DNA repair of O(6)-methylguanine. The extract of H.pylori may contain methylating or alkylating agents, which might induce O (6)-alkylguanine in DNA. Mutagenicity of the alkylating agents N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine in the Ames test with S.typhimurium TA1535 was enhanced significantly in the presence of the extract of H.pylori. The tested extracts of H.pylori resulted in a significant induction of micronuclei in human-derived lymphoblastoid cells. Heat instability and dialysis resistance of the extracts of H.pylori suggest that the mutagenic component in the extracts of H.pylori is a heat-unstable large molecule or a heat-labile small molecule strongly attached or adsorbed to a large molecule. Proteins in the extracts of H.pylori were subsequently fractionated using ammonium sulphate precipitation. However, all fractions expressed enhancing effects toward MNU mutagenicity. These results suggest the mutagenic component is a small molecule that is absorbed into proteins in the extract of H.pylori, which resist dialysis. Continuous and chronic exposure of gastric epithelial cells to the alkylative mutagenic component from H.pylori chronically infected in the stomach might be a causal factor in the gastric carcinogenesis associated with H.pylori.

1398,"Various combinations of Salmonella typhimurium tester strains and S9 mix for bioactivation (TA98+S9 mix, TA98S; YG1041+S9 mix, YG1041S) and strain YG1041 in the absence of S9 mix (YG1041) were used to evaluate the mutagenic activity of eight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), seven nitroarenes (NAs) and seven aromatic amines (AAs). Three cigarette smoke extracts and two extracts of smokers' urine (SUE) were also included. Urinary mutagenicity was then determined on 31 individuals, potentially exposed to PAHs, for 0 h, 7 h, 12 h and 24 h. Concentrations of urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1OHP) and 3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene (3OHBaP), the levels of atmospheric pyrene (Py) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), and particulate concentrations in air (AP) were also measured. PAHs could be detected by TA98S and YG1041S, with TA98S being more sensitive than YG1041S. While NAs could be detected by all combinations, YG1041 and YG1041S were more sensitive than TA98S. Although both YG1041S and TA98S could detect AAs, YG1041S was more sensitive than TA98S. Cigarette smoke extract contained mutagenic AAs and NAs, but AAs were the only mutagenic compounds detected in the extracts of smokers' urine. The concentrations of 1OHP (7 h and 12 h) were significantly higher than those at 0 h, but no difference could be detected with 3OHBaP. Correlations were found between Py and 1OHP (7 h and 24 h) and between BaP and 3OHBaP concentrations (7 h, 12 h and 24 h). A significantly elevated urinary mutagenicity was detected with YG1041S at 7h in the group of smokers. A good correlation was determined between AP and the test results with TA98S (7 h) and with YG1041 (0 h and 7 h). Urinary 1OHP correlated with the test results with YG1041S (0 h, 7 h and 12 h) while 3OHBaP correlated with those obtained with YG1041S (7 h). Overall, 21/31 individuals were occupationally exposed to AAs, 15/31 individuals were exposed to NAs, and 2/31 were exposed to PAHs as indicated by the Salmonella mutagenicity assay. The urine mutagenicity test was not effective at monitoring occupational exposure to PAHs. However, the correlation with AP implied the presence of unknown mutagenic atmospheric substances that could modulate the urinary mutagenicity.",Is AAs mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

Nitration of these PAH by NO2 and traces of HNO3, which are also formed in automobile exhaust, seems highly probable. To identify the presence of these nitroarenes in environmental samples and to examine their mutagenic potencies we synthesized and characterized nitro derivatives of both PAH. 5-NO2B(ghi)Per (81316-87-2) and 1-NO2Cor (81316-84-9) produced 405 and 340 revertants/nmole respectively in TA98 in the presence of 0.6 mg of microsomal enzymes (S-9) per plate in the Ames test. 5,8-diNO2B(ghi)Per (83292-25-5) and 5,10-diNO2B(ghi)Per (83292-26-6) produced 21,500 and 4,000 revertants/nmole in TA98 without microsomal activation. Mutagenicity for the dinitrobenzo(ghi)perylenes was also high in TA98NR and TA97 but was reduced by 97% in TA98-1,8DNP.

1400,"Approximately 70 anthraquinones and 20 benzanthrones were assayed for mutagenicity in the Salmonella/microsome test, employing 5 tester strains and Aroclor 1254 induced rat-liver microsomes. About one-third of the anthraquinones were frameshift mutagens, particularly phenolic and nitro anthraquinones. The most potent mutagens detected were of plant origin. Lucidin (1,3-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethylanthraquinone) and its 2-ethyl ether gave values of 70 and 82 revertants per nmol, respectively, with strain TA100 (and microsomes in the case of the ether). A number of glycosides of mutagenic hydroxyanthraquinones were found to be nonmutagenic in the standard assay procedure, but could be activated by incorporation of cell-free sonic extracts of rat cecal bacteria, e.g., alizarin-2-O-beta-D-glycoside, emodin-1 (8)-monoglucoside and lucidin-3-O-primveroside.

1401,"For centuries, plants have been used in traditional medicines, and there has been recent interest in the chemopreventive properties of compounds derived from plants. In the present study, we investigated the free-radical-scavenging, antioxidant, and antimutagenic potential of polar extracts from Phlomis crinita Cav. flowers. Ethyl acetate, chloroform, and methanol extracts were prepared from powdered Phlomis flowers and characterized for the presence of tannins, flavonoids, iridoids, sterols, cardiac glycosides, and anthraquinones. All the extracts showed increased activity in scavenging the ABTS free radical, but only ethyl acetate and methanol extracts were active in scavenging the superoxide anion generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system. In addition, all the extracts significantly decreased the mutagenicity induced by 2-aminoanthracene in the presence of a metabolizing homogenate (S9) and methyl methane sulfonate in the absence of metabolizing system, using the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA102 and TA104.

1403,"D & C Red No. 9 is a monoazo dye used for manufacturing printing inks, rubber and plastics, and as an additive in cosmetics and drugs. In an NTP carcinogenicity study in rats and mice it induced splenic sarcomas and liver nodules in male rats; no chemical-related tumours were induced in mice. On the basis of its contradictory responses in a range of in vitro tests and its inactivity in several in vivo genotoxicity assays, it has been suggested that the dye may act as a non-genotoxic carcinogen. We tested the dye in the Salmonella mutagenicity assay using several different protocols. The dye was not mutagenic when tested using the standard (aerobic) preincubation protocol. Variable responses were seen when the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) reduction protocol was used. A third protocol was provided by incubating the test compound overnight with a rat caecal preparation under anoxic conditions to reduce the azo bond. Ethyl acetate extracts of this incubation mixture, when tested in the standard preincubation protocol using induced rat liver S9, yielded dose-related mutagenic responses in TA100, and a weak response in TA98. The presuemed major reduction product, 1-amino-2-naphthol (1-A-2-N) was mutagenic to TA100, but not TA98, in standard protocols with S9. The results show that it is necessary to use a protocol in which D & C Red No. 9 is reduced in order to demonstrate the mutagenicity of this dye. The non-genotoxicity previously reported for D & C Red No. 9, may have been due to insufficient reductive cleavage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Is 1-amino-2-naphthol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

Propanil 3,4-dichloroaniline, and their N-OH derivatives were not mutagenic in the Salmonella typhimurium reversion assay using tester strains TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA104, in both the presence and absence of exogenous metabolic activation (S9). In addition, the test compounds were not mutagenic in the Chinese hamster ovary/hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (CHO/HGPRT) assay, in both the presence and absence of S9. 3,3',4,4'-Tetrachloroazobenzene (TCAB) and its azoxy derivative (TCAOB), which are synthetic contaminants and/or degradation products of propanil, were also inactive in the S. typhimurium reversion and CHO/HGPRT assays (+/- S9). Unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assays were performed to determine if propanil derivatives were able to induce DNA damage in primary rat hepatocytes. Although TCAB was the only derivative tested which induced an elevation in DNA repair, the extent was not statistically significant. Hepatocyte toxicity, as measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase 24 hr after exposure, was induced by all the test compounds in a concentration-dependent manner. Incubations of [14C]N-OH-3,4-dichloroaniline with DNA in vitro resulted in only a low level of binding that was not affected by pH.

ATX I was also assessed for mammalian mutagenicity at the Hprt gene locus in Chinese hamster V79 lung fibroblasts and rat hepatoma H4IIE cells. When tested from 1 to 100 microg/plate without nitrosylation, ATX I was mutagenic in TA102+/-rat liver S9 for activation and weakly mutagenic in TA104+/-S9, demonstrating direct-acting AT base pair mutagenicity. AOH was also directly mutagenic at AT sites in TA102+/-S9 while AME was weakly mutagenic in TA102+/-S9 and TA104+S9. Nitrosylation of ATX I enhanced mutagenicity at AT sites in TA104+/-S9 but produced little change in TA102+/-S9 compared to native ATX I. However, nitrosylated ATX I generated a potent direct-acting frameshift mutagen at C sites in TA97+/-S9. While ATX I was not mutagenic in either V79 cells or H4IIE cells, 5 and 10 microg/ml nitrosylated ATX I produced a doubling of 6-thioguanine resistant V79 colonies and 0.5 and 1 microg/ml were mutagenic to H4IIE cells, becoming toxic at higher concentrations.

Maltol has a caramel-butterscotch odour and is used as a food additive to impart flavour to bread and cakes. Unirradiated maltol was not mutagenic up to 5 mg/plate in the Ames test. When maltol was irradiated with either UVA (a black light, 320-400 nm, 230 microW/cm(2)) for 5-30 min or UVC (a germicidal lamp, 610 microW/cm(2)) for 3 min in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) prior to the exposure of bacterial cells, it was mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium TA100, TA104 and TA97. Mutagenic activation of maltol by UVA-irradiation was more evident in neutral and alkaline conditions (pH 7.0-9.0) than in acidic conditions. On the other hand, photomutagenicity was not observed when maltol was irradiated with UVA in 100 mM NaCl solution or water. The mutagenic photoproduct was stable for at least 60 min after UVA-irradiation. However, addition of thiol compounds (cysteine or glutathione) to the UVA-irradiated maltol diminished the mutagenicity. Mutational spectrum analysis revealed that the predominant base-substitutions induced were G:C-->T:A transversions and G:C-->A:T transitions. An increase of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine formation in salmon sperm DNA exposed to maltol and UVA in vitro was detected by HPLC-ECD, but it was too small to explain the photomutagenicity.

Sesamol was shown to exhibit strong antimutagenic effects in the Ames tester strains TA100 and TA102. The TA102 strain has been shown to be highly sensitive to reactive oxygen species. Mutagenicity was induced by the generation of oxygen radicals by tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BOOH) or hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)); therefore, the antimutagenic property of sesamol was attributed to its antioxidant properties. The superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging capabilities have further been elucidated using in vitro test systems. It was further shown to have a desmutagenic effect on t-BOOH-induced mutagenesis in TA102 strain. Sesamol also inhibited the mutagenicity of sodium azide (Na-azide) in TA100 tester strain while it had no effect on nitroquinoline-N-oxide (NQNO)-induced mutagenesis in TA98 strain of Salmonella typhimurium. Since active oxygen species are involved in multiple stage processes of carcinogenicity, this compound may also exhibit anticarcinogenic properties.",Is Sesamol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
1414,"Fourteen new quinoline derivatives were synthesised and their mutagenicity compared in the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA100 as indicator strain with and without (Aroclor-induced) S9 mix. None of the synthesised quinoline derivatives had to our knowledge been examined before in the Ames test. Quinoline and the monohydroxyquinolines were included as reference compounds. Three of the new derivatives, i.e., quinoline 7,8-oxide, N-methyl-quinoline 5,6-oxide and trans-quinoline-5,6,7,8-dioxide appeared to be mutagenic. Quinoline 7,8-oxide was positive only in the presence of S9 mix, the specific mutagenicity amounting to 2498 +/- 96 and 1289 +/- 120 revertants per mumole with 20 and 10% S9 in the mix, respectively. Both N-methyl-quinoline 5,6-oxide and trans-quinoline-5,6,7,8-dioxide were weakly positive, the former only in the presence of the S9 mix, and the latter irrespective of the presence of S9 mix, the specific mutagenicity amounting to 134 +/- 6 and 123 +/- 10 revertants per mumole, respectively. The mutagenic potency of quinoline 7,8-oxide was of the same order as that of quinoline itself and was distinctly lower than that of 8-hydroxyquinoline. Inconclusive results were obtained with trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydroquinoline, 5,6-dihydroxy-7,8-epoxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoline and 8-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide; if these compounds are mutagenic their mutagenic potency would be at least 20-30 times lower than that of the parent compounds. None of the other chemically synthesised quinoline derivatives showed mutagenic activity with TA100 either in the presence or in the absence of S9 mix. The results obtained with the reference compounds were in accordance with literature data.","Is Quinoline 7,8-oxide mutagenic for TA100 strain?",True
1415,"The food mutagen 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) is an analogue of quinoline, a hepatocarcinogen. 2-Aminofluorene, benzidine and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) are potent inducers of unscheduled DNA repair in primary culture rat liver hepatocytes, as was IQ (151 grains/nucleus at 1 X 10(-6) M). Quinoline, on the other hand, is only weakly positive in this assay (15 grains/nucleus at 1 X 10(-3) M). IQ, quinoline and DMAB were applied topically to shaved skin of Sencar mice with promotion by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) for 20 weeks, when 14 of 20 mice in the quinoline group had 25 tumors, but only one of 30 animals in the IQ group and five of 30 in the DMAB group were tumor-bearing. Analogs of IQ synthesized by substitution at the 2- or 3-position with amino or methyl groups were assayed with the Ames Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98 and TA100. Mutagenicity for TA98 is reduced in the absence of the 3-methyl group and is completely abolished with removal of the 2-amino moiety. None of these analogs are strong mutagens for TA100. Exocyclic N-oxidation is a likely obligatory step in the activation of IQ to a mutagen.",Is IQ mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1416,"In the 1970s it was shown that the monofunctional alkylating agent CB1954 (5-aziridino-2,4-dinitrobenzamide) kills the Walker rat carcinoma 256 in vivo and in vitro, but is inactive against several other tumours. In studies with bacteria, the large differences in survival in DNA-repair-proficient and deficient strains of Escherichia coli B treated with CB1954 were characteristic of a difunctional cross-linking agent. It was concluded that DNA was the only target large enough to receive significantly more than one lethal hit per molecule and that mono-alkylation alone could not account for the lethal effects of CB1954. In 1986 it was shown that CB1954 induced DNA interstrand cross-links in CB1954-sensitive cultured Walker 256 cells, but not in resistant Chinese hamster V79 cells, suggesting that the sensitivity of Walker cells results mainly from their activation of the drug to a difunctional agent by nitroreduction. To test this, we assayed the toxicity and mutagenicity of CB1954 in nitroreductase-plus and -minus strains of E. coli WP2uvrA. Agar-overlay assays showed that CB1954 was mutagenic to several strains of E. coli WP2, in a dose range 1-100 micrograms per plate, with slopes (mutants/nmol) of 7.1, 1.05 and 0.16 for WP2uvrA pKM101, WP2uvrA and WP2. Assays with nitrofurazone showed that these strains possessed nitroreductase activity. However, E. coli NFR-343, a nitrofurazone-resistant mutant of WP2uvrA which lacks nitroreductase activity was markedly less sensitive to the mutagenicity of CB1954, giving a mean slope of 0.12 compared with 1.15 for WP2uvrA.

1417,"Dicyclohexylamine x nitrite is classified as an ""experimental equivocal tumorigenic agent"" by the National Toxicology Program. Since no genotoxic effects of the substance itself are known, the reported tumorigenic potential of dicyclohexylamine x nitrite could be due to generation of N-nitrosodicyclohexylamine (N-NO-DCHA), which occurs under conditions of use and can be detected in foils that contain dicyclohexylamine x nitrite. Therefore, we investigated possible mutagenic properties of N-NO-DCHA in the Ames test and the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay with human lymphocytes. Since N-NO-DCHA is not commercially available, the substance was synthesized and purified by thin-layer chromatography. Identity was confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) and 1H- and 13C-NMR. More than 97% purity was achieved. Stability and availability in the solvent were checked by GC/MS. N-NO-DCHA induced micronuclei in isolated human lymphocytes at a dose range of 15-100 micrograms/ml (= 71.4-476.2 microM), exceeding the base rate significantly at one or two nontoxic concentrations in four out of six experiments. For the Ames test, arochlor-1254-, beta-naphthoflavone/phenobarbital- and pyrazole-induced S9-fractions were used with Salmonella typhimurium TA100, TA1535, TA98 and TA104. No effects were seen in the Ames test, with the exception of microcolony induction at doses higher than 250 micrograms (= 1.2 mmol) N-NO-DCHA/plate using TA104 and 20% arochlor-1254 induced S9 at pH 6.5. In conclusion, N-NO-DCHA was negative in the Ames test using TA98, TA100 and TA1535, inconclusive using TA104, and weakly genotoxic in the in vitro micronucleus test with isolated human lymphocytes. With regard to the tumorigenicity of the majority of nitrosamines, our data underline the necessity of further studies on possible genotoxic effects of N-NO-DCHA.",Is N-NO-DCHA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
1418,"The genotoxic environmental contaminant 1-nitropyrene is metabolised in mammalian systems by pathways more complex than the straightforward nitroreduction which accounts for most of its biological activity in bacteria. In order to evaluate the role of O-acetyltransferase (OAT) activity in generation of genotoxic intermediates from 1-nitropyrene, the mutagenicity of the major primary oxidised metabolites of 1-nitropyrene was characterised in the Ames Salmonella typhimurium plate incorporation assay with strain TA98, and with variants of TA98 deficient (TA98/1,8-DNP6) or enhanced (YG1024) in O-acetyltransferase. 1-Nitropyren-3-ol was more mutagenic in the absence than in the presence of S9, while 1-nitropyren-4-ol, 1-nitropyren-6-ol and 1-nitropyren-8-ol required S9 for maximum expression of mutagenicity. 1-Nitropyren-4-ol (176 rev/nmol without S9, 467 rev/nmol with S9 in TA98) and 1-nitropyren-6-ol (13 rev/nmol without S9, 266 rev/nmol with S9 in TA98) were overall the most potent nitropyrenol isomers assayed. 1-Acetamidopyren-8-ol and 1-acetamidopyrene 4,5-quinone were only minimally active. 1-Acetamidopyren-3-ol exhibited direct-acting mutagenicity. 1-Acetamidopyren-6-ol, previously shown to be a major contributor to mutagenicity in the urines of rats dosed with 1-nitropyrene (Ball et al., 1984b), was confirmed as a potent (359 rev/nmol) S9-dependent mutagen. Both the direct-acting and the S9-dependent mutagenicity of all the compounds studied was enhanced in the OAT-overproducing strain and much diminished (though not always entirely lost) in the OAT-deficient strain, showing that OAT amplifies expression of the genotoxicity of these compounds. 1-Acetamidopyren-6-ol required both S9 and OAT activity in order to exhibit any mutagenicity; this finding strongly implicates N-hydroxylation followed by O-esterification, as opposed to further S9-catalyzed ring oxidation, as a major route of activation for urinary metabolites of 1-nitropyrene.",Is 1-Acetamidopyren-3-ol mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1419,"The implications of disinfection by-products (DBPs) present in drinking water are of public health concern because of their potential mutagenic, carcinogenic and other toxic effects on humans. In this study, we selected 13 main DBPs found in drinking water to quantitatively analyse their cytotoxicity and genotoxicity using a microplate-based cytotoxicity assay and a developed SOS/umu assay in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. With the developed SOS/umu test, eight DBPs: 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2[5H]-fura3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2-[5H]-furanone (MX), dibromoacetonitrile (DBN), iodoacetic acid (IA), bromochloroacetonitrile (BCN), bromoacetic acid (BA), trichloroacetonitrile (TCN), dibromoacetic acid (DBA) and dichloroacetic acid (DCA) were significantly genotoxic to S. typhimurium. Three DBPs: chloroacetic acid (CA), trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and dichloroacetonitrile (DCN) were weakly genotoxic, whereas the remaining DBPs: chloroacetonitrile (CN) and chloral hydrate (CH) were negative. The rank order in decreasing genotoxicity was as follows: MX > DBN > IA > BCN > BA > TCN > DBA > DCA > CA, TCA, DCN > CN, CH. MX was approximately 370 000 times more genotoxic than DCA. In the microplate-based cytotoxicity assay, cytotoxic potencies of the 13 DBPs were compared and ranked in decreasing order as follows: MX > IA > DBN > BCN > BA > TCN > DCN > CA > DCA > DBA > CN > TCA > CH. MX was approximately 19 200 times more cytotoxic than CH. A statistically significant correlation was found between cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the 13 DBPs in S. typhimurium. Results suggest that microplate-based cytotoxicity assay and the developed SOS/umu assay are feasible tools for analysing the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of DBPs, particularly for comparing their toxic intensities quantitatively.",Is TCA mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
1420,"We performed three types of studies to evaluate the genotoxicity of the chlorinated organic solvent perchloroethylene (PERC or tetrachloroethylene) and its volatile metabolites, trichloroacetyl chloride (TCAC) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA), as well as the volatile metabolites of trichloroethylene, i.e. dichloroacetyl chloride (DCAC), dichloroacetic acid (DCA), and 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (TCE). In the first set of studies, which involved the evaluation of these chemicals in the Microscreen prophage-induction assay, only DCA (+S9) was genotoxic, producing 6.6-7.2 plaque-forming units/mM. This places DCA among the weakest of the > 100 chemicals that have been identified previously as inducers of prophage in this assay. In the second set of studies, which involved the evaluation of these chemicals in the vapor state in Salmonella TA100 using a Tedlar bag vaporization technique, DCA (+/-S9), DCAC (-S9), and TCAC (+/-S9) were mutagenic, producing 3-5x increases in revertants/plate relative to the background. S9 enhanced the mutagenic potency of DCA but had no effect on the mutagenic potency of TCAC. The potencies ranged from 0.7 to 3.9 rev/p.p.m., resulting in a potency ranking of DCA > DCAC approximately TCAC. The lowest effective concentrations were 50-300 p.p.m., which are similar to those for ethylene oxide and epichlorohydrin in this assay. In the third set of studies, the mutation spectra of DCA, DCAC, and TCAC were determined at the base-substitution allele hisG46 of Salmonella TA100. DCA and DCAC induced primarily G.C-->A.T transitions, whereas TCAC induced primarily G.C-->T.A transversions, which was also the predominant mutation among the background revertants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Is TCA mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1421,"Various substituted aniline derivatives were tested for genotoxicity in several short-term tests in order to examine the hypothesis that a substitution at both ortho positions (2,6-disubstitution) could prevent genotoxicity due to steric hindrance of an enzymatic activation to electrophilic intermediates. In the Salmonella/microsome assay, 2,6-dialkylsubstituted anilines and 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (2,4,6-TMA) were weakly mutagenic in strain TA100 when 20% S9 mix was used, although effects were small compared to those of 2,4-dimethylaniline and 2,4,5-trimethylaniline (2,4,5-TMA). In Drosophila melanogaster, however, 2,4,6-TMA and 2,4,6-trichloroaniline (TCA) were mutagenic in the wing spot test at 2-3 times lower doses than 2,4,5-TMA. In the 6-thioguanine resistance test in cultured fibroblasts, 2,4,6-TMA was again mutagenic at lower doses than 2,4,5-TMA. Two methylene-bis-aniline derivatives were also tested with the above methods: 4,4'-methylene-bis-(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA) was moderately genotoxic in all 3 test systems whereas 4,4'-methylene-bis-(2-ethyl-6-methylaniline) (MMEA) showed no genotoxicity at all. DNA binding studies in rats, however, revealed that both MOCA and MMEA produced DNA adducts in the liver at levels typically found for moderately strong genotoxic carcinogens. These results indicate that the predictive value of the in vitro test systems and particularly the Salmonella/microsome assay is inadequate to detect genotoxicity in aromatic amines. Genotoxicity seems to be a general property of aniline derivatives and does not seem to be greatly influenced by substitution at both ortho positions.",Is TCA mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True

The number of revertants was increased in the presence of S9 mix by o-tolidine in the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA1538, and by TDDM in strains TA98 and TA100. Both compounds showed weak SCE-inducing activity in cultured rabbit lymphocytes in the absence, but not in the presence, of an exogenous metabolic system.",Is o-Tolidine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1423,"NNK is a potent environmental carcinogen generated during tobacco processing and smoking. The carcinogenic response to tobacco smoking is modulated by nutritional factors. In this study, liver microsomes from phenobarbital and beta-naphthoflavone-treated or control hamsters were used to assay the mutagenicity (Salmonella typhimurium TA1535) of NNK. Western analysis of these microsomal preparations revealed an increased expression of protein recognized by polyclonal antibodies specific for P-450 1A2 in beta-naphthoflavone-induced microsomes and P-450 2B1/2B2 in phenobarbital-induced microsomes. Both inducers significantly increased the mutagenicity of NNK. Metabolism of NNK by the three microsomal preparations was compared. Metabolites formed by methyl-hydroxylation of NNK by microsomes from control animals were significantly greater than those formed by alpha-methylene hydroxylation. Phenobarbital treatment had the greatest effect on alpha-methylene hydroxylation while beta-naphthoflavone had the greatest effect on methyl hydroxylation. The antimutagenic action of the polyphenolic compounds ellagic acid, esculetin and propyl gallate correlated with an inhibition of the metabolism of NNK. There were, however, differences in the effects of these compounds on specific pathways of NNK metabolism depending upon the microsomal enzyme induction treatment. This suggests that phenolic compounds have selective affinity for specific P-450 isozymes activating NNK.",Is Phenobarbital mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
1424,"The metabolism and mutagenicity of the esophageal carcinogen N-nitroso-N-methylaniline (NMA) was studied using hepatic and esophageal 9000 X g supernatant (S-9) preparations from Sprague-Dawley rats induced with pyrazole and phenobarbital. Only pyrazole-induced hepatic S-9 was able to dose-dependently activate NMA to a mutagen in the Ames assay and specifically in Salmonella typhimurium TA1537. NMA in the presence of phenobarbital-induced S-9 gave a very weak non-dose dependent mutagenic response. Metabolism of NMA by the two induced hepatic and esophageal S-9 fractions yielded aniline and N-methylaniline (MA). Phenobarbital-induced S-9 from both tissues also afforded phenol, while none was found with the pyrazole-induced preparations. Phenol formation presumably arose from the direct oxidative demethylation of NMA via a benzenediazonium ion (BDI) intermediate. The results indicate that an important metabolic pathway for NMA, with both inducing agents, entails an initial denitrosation to yield MA, which in turn rapidly undergoes oxidative demethylation to aniline. The conversion of NMA to phenol also suggests that direct demethylation of NMA in the phenobarbital-induced system is an important metabolic pathway.",Is NMA mutagenic for TA1537 strain?,True
1425,"Cyclophosphamide must be enzymatically activated to be either mutagenic or teratogenic. This activation is thought to be catalyzed by the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase system. To study the relationship between the mutagenic and teratogenic metabolites of cyclophosphamide, the mutagenicity and teratogenicity of this drug were compared after activation by rats pretreated with chemicals (phenobarbital and beta-naphthoflavone) inducing different cytochromes P-450. Activation of cyclophosphamide to mutagenic metabolites by enzyme fractions from rats on day 13 of gestation was measured with the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA1535. Teratogenicity was assessed in vivo by treatment of rats with cyclophosphamide on day 13 of gestation. Cyclophosphamide was activated to mutagenic metabolites to the same extent (on a tissue wet weight basis) by enzyme fractions from maternal liver, kidney and placenta, despite differences in cytochrome P-450 content. Fetal homogenates did not activate cyclophosphamide. Phenobarbital pretreatment increased the activation of cyclophosphamide to mutagenic metabolites by maternal liver microsomes 10-fold and liver cytochrome P-450 content 1.8 fold; however, this drug did not alter the activation of cyclophosphamide by maternal kidney, by placenta or by the fetus. Phenobarbital pretreatment increased the teratogenicity of cyclophosphamide in rats on day 13 of gestation (increased incidence of malformed embryos, decreased fetal weight). Pretreatment with beta-naphthoflavone did not induce liver cytochrome P-450 in the pregnant rat and did not change the activation of cyclophosphamide to mutagenic metabolites by liver, kidney, placenta or the fetus. Pretreatment with this polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon had no effect or decreased the teratogenicity of cyclophosphamide. Thus, these experiments suggest that the mother, rather than the fetus, is the site of activation of cyclophosphamide; after phenobarbital pretreatment the predominant site of cyclophosphamide activation is the maternal liver. There appears to be a correlation between the teratogenicity and mutagenicity of cyclophosphamide after induction of the cytochromes P-450. We can speculate that the ""proximate teratogen"" of cyclophosphamide may also be the ""proximate mutagen"".",Is Cyclophosphamide mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
1426,"An examination has been made of some of the parameters which can affect mutant numbers in the Salmonella/microsome assay. The type of minimal media plates used for the assay and the concentration of glucose-6-phosphate, one of the co-factors necessary for mono-oxygenase action, had no effect on mutant numbers. Increases in mutated bacteria resulted from the use of (1) log-phase bacteria, (2) higher NADP concentrations than those normally recommended, and (3) higher phosphate buffer concentrations. Six mutagens, i.e., 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF), 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine (3,3'-DCB), cyclophosphamide (CY), aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) and benzo[a]pyrene (BP), all requiring mono-oxygenase activation, were studied with two Salmonella typhimurium strains, TA98 and TA100, and liver preparations from rats given different inducing agent treatments using optimum conditions. Phenobarbitone induction was generally superior to Aroclor-1254 in converting these substrates to mutagens except for the polycyclic hydrocarbon substrates. A comparison of 3-methylcholanthrene, Aroclor-1254, beta-naphthoflavone or phenobarbitone as inducing agents revealed the first three of these to be equally effective in activating BP or 3MC to mutagens, whereas phenobarbitone was less active. Dual administration of 3-methylcholanthrene and phenobarbitone to rats did not result in an additive mutagenic effect using AAF, AFB1 or 3,3'-DCB as substrates, the numbers of mutant bacteria obtained being only equal to that seen with 3-methylcholanthrene alone. These differences were not due to there being different liver protein optima for the various inducing agent treatments. The foregoing results are discussed in relation to attempts to draw up a rigid protocol for mutagenicity testing.",Is Phenobarbitone mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1427,"Perillaldehyde, a natural monocyclic terpenoid found most abundantly in the herb perilla, has a long history of use as a flavouring ingredient to add spiciness and citrus taste to foods. Previously, it was judged to be safe by several international expert panels. To confirm the safety of flavourings placed on the European Union list of flavourings, perillaldehyde was selected by the European Food Safety Authority as a representative of a subgroup of alicyclic aldehyde flavouring substances to be evaluated for genotoxic potential. Perillaldehyde was tested in a bacterial reverse mutation assay, an in vitro micronucleus assay in human lymphocytes, an HPRT assay in mouse lymphoma cells, and a micronucleus/comet assay in Han Wistar rats. In contrast to previously published results, perillaldehyde induced mutation in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of metabolic activation. The comet assay was negative for duodenum and weakly positive for liver but only at a hepatotoxic dose of perillaldehyde. All other genotoxicity assays were negative. These data do not provide an indication of any genotoxic potential for perillaldehyde, and they provide the primary basis for recent scientific opinions regarding perillaldehyde genotoxicity announced by several international organizations responsible for safety assessment of food additives and flavourings.",Is Perillaldehyde mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

The extracts of gennoshoko showed strong antimutagenicity against B(a)P with S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100, as well as Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 with S. typhimurium TA98. Yomogi, senburi and iwa-tobacco were also proved to have good antimutagenicity against Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 with S. typhimurium TA98, but weaker antimutagenicity against B(a)P.

Spectroscopic properties revealed that those compounds were 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-8-prenylflavanone (1), 5,4'-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-8-prenylflavanone (2), 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3',8-diprenylflavanone (3), and 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3',5'-diprenylflavanone (4). All isolated compounds were found for the first time in this plant. The antimutagenic IC(50) values of compounds 1-4 were 2.7 +/- 0.1, 3.7 +/- 0.1, 11.1 +/- 0.1, and 18.6 +/- 0.1 microM in the preincubation mixture, respectively. These compounds also similarly inhibited the mutagenicity of Trp-P-2 (3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole) and PhIP (2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine). All of the compounds 1-4 strongly inhibited ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylation activity of cytochrome P450 1A isoforms, which catalyze N-hydroxylation of heterocyclic amines. However, compounds 1-4 did not show significant inhibition against the direct-acting mutagen NaN(3). Thus, the antimutagenic effect of compounds 1-4 would be mainly based on the inhibition of the enzymatic activation of heterocyclic amines.","Is 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3',8-diprenylflavanone mutagenic for TA98 strain?",False
1434,"Dibenzoylmethane (DBM), a structural analogue of curcumin (a bioactive phytochemical present in a widely used spice turmeric) was screened for its inhibitory effect against seven cooked food mutagens (heterocyclic amines): 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1), in both TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium using Ames Salmonella/reversion assay in the presence of Aroclor1254-induced rat liver S9 homogenate. DBM has been reported to antagonize the mutagenicity of several chemical carcinogens in vitro and has recently been shown to be even more effective than curcumin in suppressing the 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumors in rats. But there are no reports regarding its antimutagenic properties against cooked food mutagens. Results of the present investigations clearly indicate that dibenzoylmethane is a very potent antimutagenic agent, that could effectively inhibit mutagenicity induced by all the tested cooked food mutagens in both the frame shift (TA98) as well as the base pair mutation sensitive (TA100) strains of S. typhimurium. These highly potent inhibitory effects of dibenzoylmethane against heterocyclic amines observed in our preliminary investigations strongly warrant further studies of its efficacy as a cancer chemopreventive agent.",Is Trp-P-2 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1435,"Curcumin (C) and its natural analogues demethoxycurcumin (dmC) and bisdemethoxycurcumin (bdmC), known for their potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic effects, were tested for their possible inhibitory effects against seven cooked food mutagens (heterocyclic amines): 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1), in both TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium using Ames Salmonella/reversion assay in the presence of Aroclor induced rat liver S9 homogenate. In the present investigations, curcumin as well as its two natural analogues i.e., dmC and bdmC were found to be highly effective in suppressing genotoxicity of all the tested cooked food mutagens in a dose-dependent manner, in both the frame shift (TA98) as well as base pair mutation sensitive (TA100) strains of S. typhimurium. However, bdmC appeared to be a relatively less active antimutagen compared to C and dmC. More than 80% inhibition of mutagenicity was observed at 200 microg/plate in case of C and dmC in both TA98 and TA100 against all tested cooked food mutagens. Where as, bdmC showed 39-79% inhibition in TA100 and 60-80% inhibition in TA98, at a dose of 200 microg/plate. These findings warrant further biochemical, enzymatic and in vivo investigations in animal models as well as in humans to establish the chemoprotective effect of these agents against mutagenic heterocyclic amines found in cooked food.",Is Trp-P-2 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1436,"Mutagenicity, co-mutagenicity and anti-mutagenicity of glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) were examined by the Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 with S9. As pro-mutagens, 2-aminoanthracene (2AA), Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), 3-amino-1-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4, 3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4, 5-f]quinoline (IQ) and 2-amino-3, 4-dimethylimidazo[4, 5-f]quinoline (MeIQ) were used. In addition to these pro-mutagens, blue-chitin extracts of human gallbladder bile (BCE) collected from the cholecystectomized patients with cholelithiasis were used in order to investigate the role of GUDCA on mutagen(s) actually existing in human bile. It was found that GUDCA did not show mutagenicity in this test system. Concerning the modification of mutagenic activities of pro-mutagens, GUDCA showed the different directions. GUDCA acted as co-mutagen, since it enhanced the mutagenic activities of 2AA and BaP. But, acted as anti-mutagen, since it suppressed the activities of Trp-P-2, IQ and MeIQ, all of which were classified as heterocyclic amines. GUDCA also suppressed the mutagen(s) in human bile. Because of the use of blue-chitin absorbed method for testing bile mutagenicity, the chemicals involved were considered to be heterocyclic amines and other polycyclic compounds. In these we suspect the bile mutagens are heterocyclic amines. Further examination should be directed towards the investigation into the mechanism of anti-mutagenic effects of GUDCA on mutagen(s) actually existing in human bile.",Is GUDCA mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1437,"The antimutagenicity and fermentation pattern of three Bifidobacterium longum strains (B. longum, B. longum PS+, and B. longum PS-) in skim milk were studied. The increase in fermentation time significantly increased antimutagenicity with all strains tested against the mutagenicity of both 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido-[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) in an Ames-like test using streptomycin-dependent strain SD510 of Salmonella typhimurium TA98. Bifidobacterium longum PS+, a polysaccharide-producing strain, had a longer lag phase but showed the highest inhibition percentage against both mutagens tested. The viability of B. longum PS+ cells was not affected by the low pH of 4.1, probably owing to the protection offered by the polysaccharide produced. The antimutagenicity of the fermented milk against Trp-P-1 was dose dependent. The strains were also able to bind with different amino acid pyrolysates, and B. longum showed the highest binding. Acetone extracts of fermented skim milk dissolved in water showed less antimutagenicity than extracts dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide. The isolated crude polysaccharide from B. longum PS+ showed a dose-dependent inhibition of the mutagenicity of Trp-P-1. Thus, we conclude that the polysaccharide of B. longum PS+ can be used as an antimutagen.",Is B. longum PS+ mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1438,"Streptomyces sp. KM1-30 was isolated from soil as a producer of antimutagens by screening with a modified Ames test. The chemical structure of the antimutagenic metabolite was identified as streptovaricin C, which is known to inhibit DNA dependent RNA polymerase from E. coli and RNA dependent DNA polymerase from RNA tumor viruses, by MS and 1H-, 13C-NMR analyses. Addition of streptovaricin C to the cultures of UV treated Salmonella typhimurium TA100 or Trp-P-2-treated S. typhimurium TA98 decreased the frequency of mutation without a decrease in viable cell counts. The effect of streptovaricin C to the mutation induced by UV and Trp-P-2 was not desmutagenic, but antimutagenic.",Is streptovaricin C mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1439,"We found the mechanism in flavonoids that can strongly suppress the mutagenicity of one of the food-derived and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines, 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2). The antimutagenicity was evaluated by IC50 value, the amount required for 50% inhibition of the mutagenicity of 0.1 nmol Trp-P-2, with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 strain in the presence of S9 mix. The flavones and flavonols were two orders stronger as antimutagens that such antimutagenic phytochemicals as chlorophylls and catechins. We had previously found flavonoids to be a desmutagen to neutralize Trp-P-2 before or during attack of DNA, because they had no effect on either the ultimate mutagenic form of Trp-P-2 (N-hydroxy-Trp-P-2) or the mutated cells. The desmutagenicity of the flavonoids did not depend on the hydroxy number or position that should be associated with antioxidative potency, and was also unaffected by the solubility of Trp-P-2 in the assay solution. The inhibitory effect of the flavonoids on the metabolic activation of Trp-P-2 to N-hydroxy-Trp-P-2 was almost in parallel with the antimutagenic IC50 value, when determined with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH22 cell simultaneously expressing both rat cytochrome P450 1A1 and yeast reductase. The Ki values of flavones and flavonols for the enzyme were less than 1 microM, while the K(m) value of Trp-P-2 was 25 microM. The antimutagenicity of the flavones and flavonols was thus concluded to be due to inhibition of the activation process of Trp-P-2 by P450 1A1 to the ultimate carcinogenic form. They were also able to act as antimutagens toward other indirect mutagens that were activated by P450 1A1.",Is Trp-P-2 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1440,"Using the Salmonella/microsome assay, the antimutagenic effects of specific components of the extracts from eggplant fruits were investigated. The eggplant fruit juice exhibited an antimutagenic activity against 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) induced mutagenicity. In some of the fractions extracted with several organic solvents (acetone, petroleum ether, ethyl acetate; and methanol), the activity was recognized. No mutagenicity or toxicity for Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of S9 mixture was observed with any of the extracts. It is suggested that there are multiple components of the activities that exist in the eggplant fruit. We isolated lutein from the 84% methanol (methanol/water, v/v) layer, pheophorbide or chlorophyllide from the 70% methanol layer and tannins containing sugar-moieties from the water layer. Pheophytin a and b, Mg-free derivatives of chlorophyll a and b, were isolated from the petroleum ether layer as possible antimutagens. The pheophytin a with S9 mix inhibited by 30-40% the mutagenicity of Trp-P-2.",Is pheophytin mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1441,"Water extracts of eight brands (five types: 'green', 'black', 'oolong', decaffeinated and instant) of common teas (derived from Camellia sinensis) and infusions of six randomly selected herbal teas were examined for inhibitory or potentiating effects on the mutagenicity of eight heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAA) using the Ames Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and S-9 assay. HAA, produced in foods during regular heat processing of meat, exhibit mutagenic/carcinogenic activities. Tea extracts from C. sinensis displayed very potent antimutagenic effects against most HAA: total or substantial inhibition of mutagenic activity of the eight HAA was obtained with extracts equivalent to 50 mg tea leaves/plate (mgEq) and potent inhibition was frequently achieved even with 10 mgEq/plate. Decaffeinated tea produced the same effect as observed for 'regular' teas. However, lower concentrations of some tea extracts enhanced mutagenic activity of 2-amino-3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (4,7,8-TriMeIQx) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2). Herbal tea extracts displayed variable effects on the mutagenicity of different HAA. While some extracts had no effect, others exhibited a moderate inhibitory effect on the mutagenicity of IQ-type HAA. In contrast to common tea, herbal teas showed substantial potentiating effects on the mutagenicity of several HAA, especially Trp-P-2 and 4,7,8-TriMeIQx.",Is C. sinensis mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1442,"Lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus Stapf) was extracted with 80% ethanol. The extract was not found to be mutagenic in the Salmonella mutation test with or without metabolic activation. However, the extract was found to possess antimutagenic properties towards chemical-induced mutation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. Mutagenicity of AFB1, Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2, Glu-P-1, Glu-P-2, IQ, MNNG and AF-2, was inhibited by the extract of lemon grass in a dose-dependent manner, but no effect was found on the mutagenic activity of benzo[a]pyrene.",Is Trp-P-2 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1443,"Metabolic activation of the food mutagens 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) and aflatoxin B1 by female BALB/c mice of different ages (2-24 weeks) was investigated in vivo and in vitro using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 as the indicator organism. The in vivo activation of the three mutagens was investigated in 4- and 24-week-old mice using an intrasanguineous host-mediated assay. All three compounds showed reduced levels of activation with the older hosts. Hepatic S9 fractions from female mice of varying ages between 2 and 24 weeks were used in the in vitro mutagenicity assay. To achieve optimal activation to bacterial mutagens, 5% S9 was required for aflatoxin B1 and Trp-P-2 and 10% S9 for MeIQ; age of donor generally had little effect on the profile of these protein activation curves. Under these optimal conditions MeIQ and Trp-P-2 both exhibited, as before, age-dependent decreases in activation over a wide range of mutagen concentrations, however the in vitro activation of aflatoxin showed no consistent change with age. Spectrophotometric measurements of S9 cytochrome P-450 content showed a decrease in concentration with increasing age, but this was not sufficient to account for changes observed in hepatic mutagen activation. However, changes in the activities of certain cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes and cytosolic GSH-transferases, which in turn result in changes in the activation and detoxification capacity of the liver, would appear to explain age-dependent changes in the activity of mutagens in vivo.",Is Trp-P-2 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1444,"Genotoxicity of 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) on Drosophila was suppressed by chlorophyll. Using the wing hair spot test, we found that the formation of mutant hairs in adult flies as a result of feeding them with Trp-P-2 in their larval stage was efficiently inhibited by coadministration of chlorophyll. The decrease in the spot frequencies was dependent on the dose of chlorophyll, and at the highest dose used, where the ratio in weight of Trp-P-2 to chlorophyll was 1:80, a complete prevention of the small single-spot formation was observed. A similar inhibitory effect was detected for chlorophyllin, the chromophore of chlorophyll. In the studies to investigate the mechanism of inhibition, we observed that the mutagenicity of 3-hydroxy-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole [Trp-P-2(NHOH)], the metabolically activated form of Trp-P-2, in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was suppressed effectively with chlorophyll and chlorophyllin. We also found that chlorophyll and chlorophyllin can produce complexes with Trp-P-2 and Trp-P-2(NHOH). A straightforward mechanism of these inhibitions is that Trp-P-2 [and Trp-P-2(NHOH)] becomes no longer available to organisms on forming the chlorophyll complex.",Is Trp-P-2 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1445,"The umu test system is a newly developed method to evaluate genotoxic activities of a wide variety of environmental carcinogens and mutagens (Oda et al., 1985). In the present study, we further examined the abilities of 151 chemicals to induce umu gene expression in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. Among the chemicals examined, 72 compounds induced umu gene expression, which could be defined on a basis of increased beta-galactosidase activity by 2-fold over the background level. The potent genotoxic compounds without metabolic activation were adriamycin, bleomycin, daunorubicin, 1,3-dinitropyrene, 1,6-dinitropyrene, 1,8-dinitropyrene, N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, furylfuramide, methyl methanesulfonate, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, mitomycin C, 1-nitropyrene and 4-nitroquino-line-1-oxide. In the presence of S9, aflatoxin B1, 2-aminoanthracene, Glu-P-1, IQ, MeIQ, MeIQx, Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 also induced umu gene expression markedly. Several chemicals such as 2-acetylaminofluorene, 9-aminoacridine, azobenzene, benzanthracene, benzidine, diethyl nitrosamine, 1-nitronaphthalene, paraquat, potassium dichromate and sodium nitrite were weakly genotoxic and the induction by these compounds could be detected only when the incubation time was prolonged from 2 h to 5 h. Data are also presented that some of the chemicals such as dimethyl sulfoxide, m-dioxan, 5-fluorouracil and paraquat, which have been reported to be non-mutagenic in Ames/Salmonella assay, were found to be active in inducing umu gene expression, while the known mutagenic compounds including acrylonitrile, 4,4'-dinitrobiphenyl, furfural, methylene chloride, 1-naphthylamine, sodium azide, o-tolidine and o-toluidine were non-genotoxic in the present assay system.",Is Trp-P-2 mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True

The pyrolyzates are potent mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines formed during cooking. Solution of these amines was mixed with aqueous suspension of bacterial cells or dietary fibers, and removal of these amines from the reaction mixture by centrifugation was defined as the binding. Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 were effectively bound to all gram-positive and some gram-negative bacterial cells, corn bran, apple pulp, and soy bean fiber. Binding of Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and cellulose was moderate, and to chitin and chitosan it was little. None but corn bran bound Glu-P-1 and Glu-P-2 effectively. Corn bran effectively bound all mutagens tested. The quantity of the binding of IQ, MeIQ, and MeIQx was dependent on the strain of bacteria and the kind of fiber. The mechanism of binding of Trp-P-2 to freeze-dried feces, Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC9018), and corn bran was investigated. The binding was pH dependent, occurred instantaneously, and was inhibited by the addition of metal salts. These results indicate that the binding was mostly due to a cation-exchange mechanism, but some irreversible binding of Trp-P-2 was observed, most notably to freeze-dried feces. The mutagenicity of Trp-P-2 for Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of S9 mix was inhibited by the addition of LC9018 or corn bran to the reaction mixture. The results indicate that bound Trp-P-2 did not cause mutation under the assay conditions.",Is Trp-P-2 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1447,"N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione were negative in the Ames test with 7 Salmonella strains, while L-cysteine was activated by rat liver S-9 fractions to metabolites mutagenic to strains TA102, TA97 and TA100. The mutagenic response in S. typhimurium strains (TA1535, TA98, TA100, TA102) and the levels of enzyme activities, responsible for NADP+ or GSSG reduction and for the utilization of NADPH or GSH in rat liver S-9 fractions, were investigated following in vitro preincubation of NAC with four direct-acting mutagens and six procarcinogens. Treatment with this nucleophilic and reducing compound resulted in a dose-related decrease of the direct mutagenicity of epichlorohydrin, hydrogen peroxide and, sharply, of 4-nitroquinolino-N-oxide and sodium dichromate. The mutagenicity of these compounds, both in the absence and in the presence of NAC, was decreased by rat liver S-9 fractions and to some extent by lung S-9 fractions. A diphasic effect was observed in the case of procarcinogens (cyclophosphamide, 2-aminofluorene, cigarette smoke condensate, Trp-P-2, aflatoxin B1 and benzo[a]pyrene), i.e., an enhancement of S-9 requiring mutagenicity at intermediate NAC doses, which could be ascribed to metabolic factors acting in vitro, and a loss of mutagenicity at high NAC doses, which could be ascribed to trapping of electrophilic metabolites. Out of the five S-9 enzyme activities under study, i.e., glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, GSH peroxidase and GSSG reductase, only the last one showed significant changes following mutagen and/or NAC treatment.",Is NAC mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 strain?,False
1448,"The formation of mutagens by amino-carbonyl reactions of 20 kinds of amino acid and sugars after heating at 100 degrees C for 10 h was examined by the Ames test. The browned solutions of Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Ser, Thr, Gln, Lys X HCl, Arg, Phe, Cys, Met and Pro with Glc caused mutation of Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and/or TA98 with or without S9 mix. The presence of S9 mix increased the mutagenic activity of the browned solutions of Cys and Phe with Glc on TA100 and of those of Gly, Ala, Val, Ile and Cys on TA98, but decreased the activity of other solutions. No revertants of Salmonella were induced by the browned solutions of Trp, Tyr, Asp, Asn, Glu and (Cys)2 with Glc. Among positive browned solutions, Cys, Lys, Arg and Phe had the stronger activity, but their activity was weak compared with that of pyrolysates or chemical mutagens such as Trp-P-1, Trp-P-2 and 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide. The mutagenic activity of the browned solutions increased with prolongation of heating time and varied with the pH of the reaction mixture. Fru, Gal, Ara, Xyl, Man, Lac and Suc also had the ability to form mutagens in the browning reactions with amino acids.","Is Fru, Gal, Ara, Xyl, Man, Lac mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?",True
1449,"22 arylmethane dyes which have been used as food colours, commercial dyes, laboratory stains and pH indicators were tested in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity assay. 8 mutagenic dyes were identified, including 5 food colours and 3 common laboratory strains; none of the 11 indicator dyes tested was mutagenic. The commercial and laboratory dyes Methyl Violet 2B C.I. 42535 and Crystal Violet C.I. 42555 were mutagenic in base-pair substitution mutation detector strain TA1535 in the absence of metabolic activation. By contrast, the food colours Benzyl Violet 4B C.I. 42640, Guinea Green B.C.I. 42085, Light Green SF C.I. 42095, Lissamine Green B C.I. 44090 and Violet BNP C.I. 42581 and the bacteriological stain, Basic Fuchsin C.I. 42500-42510, were all mutagenic in frameshift mutation detector strains TA98 and/or TA1538 and required metabolic activation. Most of these compounds gave weak mutagenic responses with Salmonella and were positive only within narrow dose ranges. Since conflicting results were obtained using dyes from different sources, minor dye components may have been responsible for their mutagenicity. This suggests the need to improve knowledge about impurities in arylmethane colours still used in food and to review the toxicological role of such impurities.",Is Basic Fuchsin C.I. 42500-42510 mutagenic for TA98 or TA1535 strain?,True

Urine was collected overnight at 1-wk intervals over a 4-wk treatment period and frozen until its use in the mutagenicity assay. The neat urine was tested in triplicate without S-9 on Salmonella tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 at 0.75, 0.5, 0.2, and 0.05 ml per plate. When sufficient urine was available, samples were tested on TA100 in the presence of S-9. Either urine samples were pretreated for 18 hr at 37 degrees C with beta-glucuronidase, or the deconjugating enzyme was added to the top agar at the time of plating in the mutagenicity assay (non-pretreatment). Direct-acting mutagenic activity was detected on TA98 in the urine from male mice, but only when using the non-pretreatment deconjugation method. No direct-acting mutagenic activity was detected in the urine of male and female rats and female mice; however, in the presence of S-9, mutagenic activity was observed in the urine of male rats and in the urine of male and female mice regardless of the deconjugation method used. The non-pretreatment method was superior for detecting direct acting mutagenic activity, and the pretreatment method was superior for detecting mutagenic activity requiring metabolic activation by S-9.",Is p-Rosaniline mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True

These compounds were re-assayed in the Ames test using strains TA97 and TA102. A dose-dependent mutagenic response was detected with aminoantipyrine and p-rosaniline in TA97 and with streptomycin and formaldehyde in TA102. p-Rosaniline was the only mutagen requiring metabolic activation. 5 compounds, i.e. o-aminophenol in TA97 and methanol, ethanol, cadmium chloride and cadmium sulfate in TA102, induced a reproducible increase in revertants over controls, but this was less than 2-fold. The remaining 21 chemicals--including amino compounds, aliphatics, aromatics, heterocycles, hydrazine derivatives and inorganics--confirmed their inactivity in the Ames test.

The CA test also showed that PA and TPA exerted no significant cytogenetic effect on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In the mouse MN test, no significant alteration in occurrence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was observed in ICR male mice ip administered any of these agents at doses of 0, 20, 100, 500, 2500 or 12,500 microM/kg. These results indicate that PA and TPA produced no mutagenic effects using these in vitro and in vivo mutagenic test systems.",Is TPA mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
1453,"Trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) is a product of lipid peroxidation. In the presence of t-butyl hydroperoxide the racemic HNE readily converts to its epoxide, 2,3-epoxy-4-hydroxynonanal (EH), as a pair of diastereomers. In this study, the potential roles of HNE and EH as tumor initiating agents were assessed. The mutagenicities of HNE and EH isomers in Salmonella strains TA100 and 104 were examined. In addition, the tumor initiating activities of HNE and EH were evaluated in bioassays involving either topical application in CD-1 mice or i.p. administration in newborn CD-1 mice. In the mutagenicity assays, EH isomers induced similar levels of revertants in both tester strains, although EG isomers were previously shown to react with bases in DNA with different specificity (Sodum, R.S. and Chung, F.-L., Cancer Res., 51, 137-143, 1991). The major isomer induced approximately 20,000 revertants/mumol in TA100 and 15,000 revertants/mumol in TA104, whereas, the minor isomer induced approximately 40,000 revertants/mumol in TA100 and 20,000 revertants/mumol in TA104. HNE was, however, not mutagenic under the assay conditions. In the tumor bioassays, EH was a weak tumorigen in CD-1 mice upon topical application followed by TPA promotion, yielding 0.55 tumors/mouse and 40% tumor incidence at a total dose of 128 mumol/mouse versus 0.02 tumors/mouse and 5% tumor incidence in the control group. Both HNE and EH induced liver tumors in male mice, but not in female mice. However, the incidences were not statistically significant. EH administered i.p. at a total dose of 200 nmol/mouse exacerbated the chronic spontaneous nephropathy in newborn CD-1 mice. Although the incidence of mild nephropathy was comparable in both EH-treated and control groups, the incidence of more severe lesions in mice treated with 200 nmol/mouse was 21%; while it was 0% in the control group. Furthermore, two mice at each dose level of EH showed a tubule profile with complex hyperplastic lining, suggestive of atypical hyperplasia. Again, HNE was not as active as EH in these bioassays. These results suggest a possible role of EH in tumorigenesis associated with lipid peroxidation.",Is HNE mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
1454,"The genotoxic environmental contaminant 1-nitropyrene is metabolised in mammalian systems by pathways more complex than the straightforward nitroreduction which accounts for most of its biological activity in bacteria. In order to evaluate the role of O-acetyltransferase (OAT) activity in generation of genotoxic intermediates from 1-nitropyrene, the mutagenicity of the major primary oxidised metabolites of 1-nitropyrene was characterised in the Ames Salmonella typhimurium plate incorporation assay with strain TA98, and with variants of TA98 deficient (TA98/1,8-DNP6) or enhanced (YG1024) in O-acetyltransferase. 1-Nitropyren-3-ol was more mutagenic in the absence than in the presence of S9, while 1-nitropyren-4-ol, 1-nitropyren-6-ol and 1-nitropyren-8-ol required S9 for maximum expression of mutagenicity. 1-Nitropyren-4-ol (176 rev/nmol without S9, 467 rev/nmol with S9 in TA98) and 1-nitropyren-6-ol (13 rev/nmol without S9, 266 rev/nmol with S9 in TA98) were overall the most potent nitropyrenol isomers assayed. 1-Acetamidopyren-8-ol and 1-acetamidopyrene 4,5-quinone were only minimally active. 1-Acetamidopyren-3-ol exhibited direct-acting mutagenicity. 1-Acetamidopyren-6-ol, previously shown to be a major contributor to mutagenicity in the urines of rats dosed with 1-nitropyrene (Ball et al., 1984b), was confirmed as a potent (359 rev/nmol) S9-dependent mutagen. Both the direct-acting and the S9-dependent mutagenicity of all the compounds studied was enhanced in the OAT-overproducing strain and much diminished (though not always entirely lost) in the OAT-deficient strain, showing that OAT amplifies expression of the genotoxicity of these compounds. 1-Acetamidopyren-6-ol required both S9 and OAT activity in order to exhibit any mutagenicity; this finding strongly implicates N-hydroxylation followed by O-esterification, as opposed to further S9-catalyzed ring oxidation, as a major route of activation for urinary metabolites of 1-nitropyrene.",Is 1-Acetamidopyren-8-ol mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1455,"22 arylmethane dyes which have been used as food colours, commercial dyes, laboratory stains and pH indicators were tested in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity assay. 8 mutagenic dyes were identified, including 5 food colours and 3 common laboratory strains; none of the 11 indicator dyes tested was mutagenic. The commercial and laboratory dyes Methyl Violet 2B C.I. 42535 and Crystal Violet C.I. 42555 were mutagenic in base-pair substitution mutation detector strain TA1535 in the absence of metabolic activation. By contrast, the food colours Benzyl Violet 4B C.I. 42640, Guinea Green B.C.I. 42085, Light Green SF C.I. 42095, Lissamine Green B C.I. 44090 and Violet BNP C.I. 42581 and the bacteriological stain, Basic Fuchsin C.I. 42500-42510, were all mutagenic in frameshift mutation detector strains TA98 and/or TA1538 and required metabolic activation. Most of these compounds gave weak mutagenic responses with Salmonella and were positive only within narrow dose ranges. Since conflicting results were obtained using dyes from different sources, minor dye components may have been responsible for their mutagenicity. This suggests the need to improve knowledge about impurities in arylmethane colours still used in food and to review the toxicological role of such impurities.",Is Methyl Violet 2B C.I. 42535 mutagenic for TA98 or TA1535 strain?,True
1456,"Participation of bacteria producing urease: Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis in degradation of pesticides--urea derivatives, was investigated. Four new compounds were studies: N-/(3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl/N'-(2-cyanoethyl)-urea (IPO 6584), N-(4-chlorophenyl)-N'-(2-hydroxyethyl)-N'-ethylurea (PO 6236), N-(4-chlorophenyl)-N'-(2-hydroxyethyl), N'-propyl-urea (IPO 6237), N-(2-hydroxyethyl), N-methyl-N'-(3,4 dichlorophenyl)-urea (IPO 3102), pesticide reference standard--thiram fungicide--tetramethyl-bis-thiocarbamyl disulfide, and rodenticide-alpha-naphthylthiourea (ANTU). Investigated compounds were incubated with cells of P. mirabilis 4508 ans S. epidermidis CCM 2448 and commercial preparation of urease from beans. Mutagenicity of resulting metabolites was then studies by the Ames test. All compounds were decomposed by bacteria used in this study, as well with beans urease with different activity. Reaction products did not exhibit mutagenic activity for test strains S. typhimurium his- TA97a, TA98, TA100 and TA102.",Is IPO 3102 mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
1457,"An increase in the number of revertant colonies in the Ames test is generally taken as a strong indication of mutagenic activity of a test compound. However, irrelevant positive findings may constitute a major problem in regulatory drug testing. In this study, mixtures containing only amino acids such as glycine, lysine, arginine and isoleucine, routinely used as peptide preservatives in polypeptide pharmaceutical products, were investigated for mutagenesis in the Ames Salmonella typhimurium test. The results demonstrated that in the presence of metabolic activation, all the solutions containing arginine induced an increase in the number of revertant colonies in strains TA98, TA100 and TA1535 compared with the solvent control. More specifically, for strain TA98, all arginine doses tested, i.e. from 0.4 to 8 mg/plate induced a statistically significant increase in the number of revertants. This increase was biologically significant from 1.2 to 8 mg/plate. For strain TA100, the five highest test doses, i.e., from 1.2 to 8 mg/plate, induced statistically and biologically significant increases in the number of revertants. A statistically significant increase in colony number was also observed in strain TA1535, but only at the maximal test dose of 8 mg/plate arginine. These increases were observed with arginine from two different sources, suggesting that the observed effect would not be due to the presence of potential impurities in the type of arginine used. Our findings show that a functional metabolic activation system was required to induce an increase in the number of colonies. The presence of vitamin C inhibited the arginine-induced increase in the number of revertant colonies in S. typhimurium strain TA98, suggesting a potential involvement of oxidative stress.",Is arginine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 strain?,True
1458,"The antimutagenic effects of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) prepared by heating three sugars (fructose, glucose and xylose) and four amino acids (arginine, glycine, lysine and tryptophan) at 100 degrees C for 10 hr was evaluated in the Salmonella/microsome assay. The highest extent of browning was found in the MRPs of sugars-lysine and xylose-amino acids. The MRPs of xylose-amino acids showed stronger antioxidative activity and reducing power than did the other combinations. No mutagenicity or toxicity in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was observed with any of the MRPs in the presence of S-9. Most MRPs, especially those of sugars-tryptophan and xylose-amino acids, strongly inhibited the mutagenicity of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoline (IQ), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyridol-(4,3-b)indole (Trp-P-1) and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido(1,2-a:3',2'-d)imidazole (Glu-P-1) in the presence of S-9. However, the MRPs of fructose-glycine and fructose-arginine increased the mutagenicity of Trp-P-1. The antimutagenic effect of the MRPs was well correlated with their antioxidative activity and reducing power. The mutagenicity of benzo[a]pyrene was moderately inhibited by most MRPs, but was increased by the MRP of glucose-arginine. Aflatoxin B1 mutagenicity was increased greatly by all the MRPs except that of xylose-tryptophan. The findings suggested that MRPs might have a bifunctional property of co-mutagenicity and antimutagenicity in certain cases.",Is xylose-amino acids mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1459,"Heated sugar/amino acid reaction mixtures, known to contain products that are clastogenic and/or mutagenic to cells in vitro, were evaluated for clastogenic activity in mouse bone marrow using the erythrocyte micronucleus assay. Heated (i.e. browned) fructose/lysine reaction mixtures were also evaluated in the Salmonella his-reversion assay and the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell chromosomal aberration assay to confirm and extend previous in vitro observations. Significant mutagenicity of fructose/lysine mixtures was observed in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA2637, TA98 and TA102, with greater activity in mixtures heated at pH 10 than at pH 7. S-9 decreased the activity in strains TA100, TA2637 and TA98, but increased the activity in strain TA102. Both pH 7 and pH 10 reaction mixtures of the fructose/lysine browning reaction were highly clastogenic in CHO cells. Heated mixtures of fructose and lysine, and of glucose or ribose with lysine, histidine, tryptophan or cysteine, did not increase the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes in mice when administered by the oral route. This indicates the absence of chromosomal aberrations in erythrocyte precursor cells, and indicates that the genotoxic components of the browned mixtures are not absorbed and distributed to bone marrow cells in amounts sufficient to induce micronuclei when given orally. Because sugar/amino acid browning reactions occur commonly in heated foods, it is important to evaluate further the in vivo genotoxicity of browning products in cell populations other than bone marrow.",Is lysine mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True

1461,"Ten different amino acid-glucose Maillard browning products before and after reaction with nitrite were evaluated by the Ames mutagenicity assay. No mutagenic response was observed in the methylene chloride extracts of any browning products tested before nitrosation. However, mutagenicity was showed in most of the browning mixtures, e.g., glycine-glucose, lysine-glucose (I), arginine-glucose, phenylalanine-glucose (II), and methionine-glucose after nitrosation when examined by Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 either with or without S-9 metabolic activation. Among the browning mixtures, (I) and (II) showed the greatest mutagenic activity after reaction with nitrite. The mutagenicity of lysine-glucose with nitrite was dependent on browning intensity, nitrosation pH, nitrosation time, nitrite level and blocking agents.",Is lysine-glucose mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1462,"Pyrolysis products of proteins and amino acids are highly mutagenic, but metabolism of these chemicals by rat liver subcellular fractions is known to be required for production of the mutagenic intermediates. We examined the mutagenesis of seven purified pyrolysis products from tryptophan, lysine, glutamic acid, and soybean globulin with Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the presence of liver fractions from genetically ""responsive"" C57BL/6N and Ah(b)/Ah(d) or ""nonresponsive"" DBA/2N and Ah(d)/Ah(d) mice that had been pretreated in vivo with benzo[a]pyrene. For all pyrolysis products tested, mutagenesis is 2-fold to more than 1000-fold greater with C57BL/6N and Ah(b)/Ah(d) than with DBA/2N or Ah(d)/Ah(d) liver fractions. A sucrose density gradient assay for detecting the Ah regulatory gene product, the receptor, was studied with C57BL/6N hepatic cytosol. At levels 100 times in excess of [1,6-(3)H]2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, nonlabeled 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, 3-methylcholanthrene, and beta-naphthoflavone (inducers of cytochrome P(1)-450) are able to displace the radioligand from its hepatic cytosolic receptor; four pyrolysates from tryptophan, glutamic acid, and soybean globulin did not have this capacity. These data indicate that the pyrolysis products tested, although not effective as inducers of cytochrome P(1)-450, are most mutagenic when metabolized by P(1)-450. Potent P(1)-450 inducers-present in pyrolysates during the combustion process-might be present in quantities insufficient to initiate mutagenesis or carcinogenesis but might have a synergistic action, or act as ""comutagens"" or ""cocarcinogens,"" with the N-containing heterocyclic pyrolysis products.

Their main components are R-(+)-limonene, β-thujene, α-myrcene and γ-terpinene. The aim of this work was to evaluate their antimutagenic and antioxidant capacities. Antimutagenic properties were evaluated against MNNG and ENNG on S. typhimurium TA100; against 2AA on strain TA98 and in front of 4NQO and NOR on strain TA102. Both were antimutagenic against MNNG (p < 0.001) but only C. latifolia was antimutagenic against ENNG (p < 0.001). Both presented antimutagenic activity against 2AA (p < 0.001). They were antioxidant against the ROS-generating compound 4NQO (p < 0.001) and the antibiotic NOR (p < 0.001). In the antioxidant evaluation, the activity in DPPH assay was in a range of 6-23% for C. sinensis and of 22-71% for C. latifolia. Both were antioxidant compared with BHT in β-carotene bleaching assay and were able to decreased apoptosis in HaCat cells stimulated with H 2 O 2 . The levels of intracellular superoxide ion were lower in the presence of both oils. In conclusion, the essential oils of C. sinensis and C. latifolia are antimutagenic against at least three types of mutagens and have antioxidants properties.",Is Citrus latifolia mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
1466,"We used bacterial mutation and yeast genotoxicity tests to evaluate the effects of intermediate frequency (IF; 2 kHz, 20 kHz and 60 kHz) magnetic fields (MFs) on mutagenicity, co-mutagenicity and gene conversion. We constructed a Helmholtz type exposure system that generated vertical and sinusoidal IF MFs, such as 0.91 mT at 2 kHz, 1.1 mT at 20 kHz and 0.11 mT at 60 kHz. Mutagenicity, co-mutagenicity and gene conversion assays were performed for each of the three MF exposure conditions. Mutagenicity testing was performed in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537) and two strains of Escherichia coli (WP2 uvrA and WP2 uvrA/pKM101) to cover a wide spectrum of point mutations. For co-mutagenicity tests, we used four sensitive test strains (TA98, TA100, WP2 uvrA and WP2 uvrA/pKM101) with five chemical mutagens (t-butyl hydroperoxide (BH, a hydroxyl free radical precursor), 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide (AF2) and N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG, DNA reactive reagents), benz[a]pyrene (BaP) and 2-aminoanthracene (2AA, DNA reactive promutagens). Gene conversion testing was performed in the yeast test strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae XD83. We also examined the effects on the repair process of DNA damage by UV irradiation. No statistically significant effects were observed between exposed and control groups in any of the genotoxicity tests, indicating that the IF MFs (0.91 mT at 2 kHz, 1.1 mT at 20 kHz or 0.11 mT at 60 kHz) do not have mutagenic or co-mutagenic potentials for the chemical mutagens tested under these experimental conditions.

1467,"Several mutants with decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were isolated from the sensitive mutagen tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA100 after treatment with u.v. and selection for resistance to N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG) and its methyl analogue MNNG. Estimation of the GSH concentration and GSH S-transferase activity in extracts of these strains and of TA100 indicates that the GSH- derivatives contain 10-30% of the GSH level found in TA100, and that they exhibit normal GSH S-transferase activity. The mutagenic activities of 7 chemicals, namely, MNNG, ENNG, 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE), 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), styrene-7,8-oxide (STOX), N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) were compared in TA100 and in one representative GSH- strain, denominated NG-57. MNNG, ENNG, DBE and CDNB are potent to extremely potent mutagens in TA100, but induce very low levels of His+ mutants in NG-57. Pretreatment of NG-57 with 1 mM GSH (partially) restores the mutant yields to the levels usually found in TA100. The mutagenic activities of STOX, ENU and MMS are similar in both strains. These results support some previous findings, namely that ENNG, MNNG and DBE, but not ENU are activated to mutagens inside the test bacteria, and also suggest that CDNB is activated by bacterial GSH. The latter finding is in contrast with the current view that CDNB is detoxified by GSH, as is also presently evidenced by a strong reduction of the compound's mutagenicity in the presence of extracts of rat liver, which contains GSH and GSH S-transferase activity. The results with STOX indicate that GSH plays in bacteria a much less important role in the detoxification of xenobiotics than in mammalian tissue, presumably due to a much lower GSH S-transferase activity in the first organism.",Is ENNG mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1468,"In Taiwan, betel quid is a natural masticatory, which is composed of fresh green areca fruit, Piper betle and slaked lime paste. Areca fruit contains some alkaloids, of which arecoline is the major one. N-Nitrosoguvacoline (NG), one of the N-nitrosation products of arecoline, is the only one N-nitrosamine found in Taiwanese betel quid chewing saliva. The mutagenic studies in Ames Salmonella microsome test showed that crude alkaloid extracts of areca fruit and arecoline were active in Salmonella typhimurium TA100, and NG was weakly active in TA98 and TA100. The activities in both arecoline and NG decreased further in the presence of rat liver S9 mix. Nitrite was significantly consumed during the N-nitrosation of arecoline and sodium nitrite at acidic condition (pH 3), whereas the formation of NG was favored at neutral condition (pH 7). Crude phenolic extracts of leaf and inflorescence of Piper betle inhibited the formation of NG by blocking the nitrite.

1469,"P-Benzoquinone dioxime (BQD) appears to be a sex-specific rat carcinogen inducing tumours of the urinary bladder in female rats. The present paper shows that BQD is a direct-acting mutagen in Salmonella typhimurium TA98, confirming published data. In contrast to this in vitro data, negative results were obtained after oral administration of BQD to female rats in both the bone marrow micronucleus test and the in vivo liver UDS test. BQD did, however, induce a marked effect upon S-phase synthesis in the livers of female rats between 14 and 48 hr after a single oral dose of 250 mg/kg. A similar effect was also observed in the livers of male rats. There was no evidence of hepatotoxicity (in terms of elevated liver enzyme levels) after treatment of female rats with the compound indicating that the increase in cell proliferation was due to a direct mitogenic effect of BQD in this organ. Some liver mitogens have been found to be liver carcinogens; this does not appear to be the case for BQD. Nevertheless, the mitogenic activity of this compound might play a contributory role to the induction of bladder cancer in rats if it also acted as a mitogen in this tissue. Further studies are indicated, measuring genotoxicity and cell-proliferative activity in the bladder in order to further elucidate the mechanism of action of this compound as a rodent carcinogen.",Is Benzoquinone dioxime mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1470,"3-Chloro-4-(chloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (CMCF), a chlorine disinfection by-product in drinking water, was mutagenic in the Salmonella/his (Ames) assay for both base-pair substitution strains (TA1535, TA100, TA102) and frameshift strains (TA97, TA98) with the highest mutagenic response observed in strain TA100 (1292 revertants/microgram). The presence in TA100 of pKM101 plasmid, which enhances error-phone DNA repair, greatly increased susceptibility to CMCF mutagenicity relative to the isogenic strain TA1535 lacking pKM101. In the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell hprt (6-thioguanine resistance) locus assay, the mutagenicity of CMCF (1.04 mutants/10(6) clonable cells per microgram/ml) was barely detectable because of the low mutagenicity/cytotoxicity ratio. From the present experiments it appears that CMCF acts in a manner similar to that of another drinking water mutagen, 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX). However, CMFC appears to be a less potent mutagen in vitro than MX.",Is 3-Chloro-4-(chloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone mutagenic for pKM101 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 or TA98 strain?,True
1471,The mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of parathion-methyl were examined by bacterial reverse mutation assay and a long-term experiment with wistar rats. The potential mutagenic effect of parathion-methyl in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 bacterial cells was observed without rat liver S9 metabolic activation. Parathion-methyl was further investigated for pathological changes in rat pancreas and liver. The long-term rat experiments showed that parathion-methyl exposure for 3 months can cause pathological changes in rat pancreases acinar cells and pancreatic hepatocytes. Atypical acinar cell focuses (AACF) were determined in the liver and pancreas of the rats. The results from short-term Ames test and long-term rat experiments suggested that parathion-methyl would be potential carcinogenic.,Is parathion-methyl mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1472,"Comparison studies for detecting differences between liver microsome and S9 preparations from 4 strains (Donryu, Fischer, Sprague-Dawley, Wistar) of young male rats were carried out with pretreatment of the animals by inducers such as PCBs and PB plus 5,6-BF. Each microsome fraction was assayed for the enzymic activity of metabolism of model substrates such as aniline, benzophetamine, BP, DMN and 7-ethoxycoumarin. The hepatic S9 sample was also compared, as regards its metabolizing ability to activate 9 pre-mutagens (2AA, AAF, o-AAT, BP, DAB, DMBA, DMN, m-PDA, quinoline) to directly acting mutagens in the Salmonella/hepatic S9 activation test by using TA98, TA100 and TA1537 strains with or without cytochrome P450 inhibitors (SKF-525A, metyrapone, 7,8-benzo-flavone). In the enzymic assay with PCBs-induced microsomes, BP hydroxylation a strain-specific difference: the microsomes from Fischer and Wistar rats were more effective for metabolizing BP than those from the other strains of rat. The effect of induction by BP plus 5,6-BF for Fischer rats showed relatively higher enzymic activity in the same induction group. Other microsomes prepared from rats with and without induction by PB plus, 5,6-BF did not show a clear-cut strain dependency in the enzymic activities assayed. In the mutation experiments with hepatic S9 samples, the examination of DAB and quinoline revealed a marked strain difference when S9 samples prepared from PCBs-pretreated and PB-plus-5,6-BF-induced rats were used: the S9 sample from Fischer rats was available for activating the two pre-mutagens to directly acting mutagens. No marked difference in the metabolic activation of the remaining 7-pre-mutagens was observed on other S9 preparations. In examinations of mutagenicity activities with the use of three inhibitors, the two S9 preparations made with the two induction methods showed inhibition profiles closely similar to each other. However, there were minor differences in the profiles by these inhibitors. From these findings it was concluded that Fischer rat-liver S9 is useful for detecting mutagens in the metabolic activation test, when induction by PB plus 5,6-BF was used in the Ames Salmonella test.","Is 5,6-BF mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1537 strain?",True
1473,"Previously, we isolated and identified anti-mutagenic and anti-inflammatory components from Vitis coignetiae (crimson glory vine, known as yamabudo in Japan) as 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (DBQ), fertaric acid and caftaric acid. We also reported that the oral intake of a partially purified fraction from yamabudo juice (yamabudo-fr) or DBQ affords significant protection against two-stage skin carcinogenesis in mice. In this study, we found that oral intake of yamabudo-fr or DBQ affords significant protection against a tobacco-specific nitrosamine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)-induced mouse model of lung tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we investigated the anti-tumorigenic mechanisms of yamabudo juice and DBQ. NNK is known to be a DNA-methylating and alkylating agent; thus, we investigated the anti-tumorigenic mechanisms of yamabudo juice and DBQ in relation to DNA methylation. Pretreatment with yamabudo-fr or DBQ dose-dependently decreased formation of O 6 -methylguanine and N 7 -methylguanine in DNA of the A549 human lung epithelial-like cell line treated with a methylating agent, 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine. Yamabudo juice and DBQ inhibited the mutagenicity of NNK in the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 but not S. typhimurium YG7108, an alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase-deficient strain (same as TA1535 but Δada st ::Km r , Δogt st ::Cm r ). Yamabudo juice and DBQ might accelerate the repair of DNA damage caused by NNK and reduce DNA damage to cells. We also investigated the effects of yamabudo juice and DBQ on signaling pathways in A549 cells. With or without epidermal growth factor stimulation, phosphorylation of Erk1/2, Akt and Stat3 in A549 cells was significantly decreased in the presence of yamabudo juice or DBQ, indicating that yamabudo juice and DBQ suppressed PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways. These results suggest that both initiation and growth/progression steps in carcinogenesis, especially anti-oxidant effects, stimulation of repair of alkyl DNA adducts and suppressed growth signaling pathways are potential anti-tumorigenic targets of yamabudo juice and DBQ in NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis.",Is Yamabudo juice mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,False
1474,"3-Methylindole (3MI) is a preferential pneumotoxicant found in cigarette smoke. A number of lung-expressed human cytochrome P450 enzymes, including 1A1, 2F1, and 2A13, catalyze the metabolism of 3MI to reactive intermediates that fragment DNA, measured with the Comet assay to assess DNA damage, in a cytochrome P450-dependent manner in primary normal human lung cells in culture, but the mutagenesis of 3MI has been controversial. In the present study, the mutagenic potential of 3MI was compared to the prototypical cigarette smoke carcinogens benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK). 3MI, B(a)P, and NNK were incubated with the Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98, which is known to detect the most common subtype of cigarette smoke-induced mutagenicity, frameshift mutations in DNA, and with Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100, which detects base pair substitution mutants, with five sources of P450-mediated bioactivation: rat liver S9, human lung microsomes, recombinant CYP2A13, purified CYP2F3, and recombinant CYP1A1. Only B(a)P was mutagenic in TA100, and it was bioactivated by human lung microsomes and rat liver S9 sources of P450s. However, with the TA98 strain, CYP1A1, CYP2A13, CYP2F3, and human lung microsomes bioactivated 3MI to highly mutagenic intermediates, whereas neither human nor rat liver S9 subcellular fractions formed mutagenic intermediates from 3MI. Quantitative Western blot analysis verified that all three respiratory enzymes were present in human lung microsomes in widely varying amounts. These results indicate that metabolism of 3MI by human lung-expressed cytochrome P450 enzymes but not hepatic P450s elicits equivalent or higher mutagenicity than the prototype cigarette smoke mutagens B(a)P and NNK and indicates that 3MI is a likely human pulmonary carcinogen.",Is 3MI mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1475,"The first aim was to compare the genotoxicities of two tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNA), 4-(methylnitrosamino)-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) in two types of tests, the Salmonella reverse mutation assay (250-2000 microg per plate) and the Mutatox test (up to 1000 microg/ml) using dark mutant M-169 of Vibrio fischeri. The second aim was to assess the effects of single other tobacco chemicals and metabolites (nicotine (NIC), cotinine (COT), trans-3-hydroxycotinine (3HC), cotinine-N-oxide (CNO) and nicotine-N-oxide (NNO)) on the mutagenic responses at relative concentrations observed physiologically. The Salmonella strains were TA100, TA7004, TA7005, and TA7006, all showing missense backmutations that are characteristic of the TSNA. NNN was a direct mutagen to strains TA100, TA7004, and in the Mutatox test, and was not mutagenic in the presence of rat or hamster S9. NNK was mutagenic only in strain TA7004 with rat and hamster S9, but not in TA100, but was directly mutagenic in the Mutatox test. While all the other tobacco chemicals were not mutagenic alone to strains TA100 and TA7004 in the presence and absence of rat or hamster S9, the Mutatox test produced direct mutagenicity for COT, 3HC, and NNO, but not CNO. The latter was mutagenic in the Mutatox test with rat or hamster S9, but only rat S9 was effective for COT, NNO and 3HC. Inhibitory potentiations of NNN by NIC and COT were observed on strain TA7004, and by NIC on strain TA100. There were no interactions on NNK in the presence of S9 for strain TA7004 or TA100. In contrast, a complex inhibition and enhancement behavior occurred in the Mutatox test for each interaction, but no effects were observed for CNO on NNK without S9, and few for NIC on NNK with hamster S9. Compounds which showed no activity alone modulated the genotoxicity of two potent TSNAs in both types of tests.",Is NNN mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1476,"NNK is a potent environmental carcinogen generated during tobacco processing and smoking. The carcinogenic response to tobacco smoking is modulated by nutritional factors. In this study, liver microsomes from phenobarbital and beta-naphthoflavone-treated or control hamsters were used to assay the mutagenicity (Salmonella typhimurium TA1535) of NNK. Western analysis of these microsomal preparations revealed an increased expression of protein recognized by polyclonal antibodies specific for P-450 1A2 in beta-naphthoflavone-induced microsomes and P-450 2B1/2B2 in phenobarbital-induced microsomes. Both inducers significantly increased the mutagenicity of NNK. Metabolism of NNK by the three microsomal preparations was compared. Metabolites formed by methyl-hydroxylation of NNK by microsomes from control animals were significantly greater than those formed by alpha-methylene hydroxylation. Phenobarbital treatment had the greatest effect on alpha-methylene hydroxylation while beta-naphthoflavone had the greatest effect on methyl hydroxylation. The antimutagenic action of the polyphenolic compounds ellagic acid, esculetin and propyl gallate correlated with an inhibition of the metabolism of NNK. There were, however, differences in the effects of these compounds on specific pathways of NNK metabolism depending upon the microsomal enzyme induction treatment. This suggests that phenolic compounds have selective affinity for specific P-450 isozymes activating NNK.",Is NNK mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
1477,"The cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and transforming activity of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) were studied by the assays of colony-forming efficiency (CFE), micronucleus formation (MN), and cell transformation in rat tracheal epithelial (RTE) cells both in vitro and in vivo. Liver S9, primary hepatocytes and RTE cells from normal and Aroclor-1254 induced rats were compared for bioactivation of NNK using Salmonella mutagenesis as the endpoint. Results from the in vitro experiments indicated that low concentrations of NNK (0.01-25 micrograms/ml) caused from 15% to greater than 100% increases in CFE of RTE cells. At high concentrations (100-200 micrograms/ml), NNK was significantly toxic to RTE cells. NNK treatment in vitro (50-200 micrograms/ml) increased MN frequency as much as 3-fold above background and significantly increased the transformation frequency (TF) in 4/5 (50 micrograms/ml) and 6/8 (100 micrograms/ml) experiments. The in vivo exposure of rats to NNK (150-450 mg/kg, given i.p.) resulted in a 60-85% reduction in CFE and a 3-5-fold increase in MN formation in RTE cells. In vivo treatment with cumulative doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg of NNK produced significant increases in TF of tracheal cells from 3/3 and 2/3 rats, respectively. Without activation, NNK was not mutagenic in Salmonella TA1535. The bioactivation of NNK to a mutagenic metabolite was achieved by incubation of NNK with liver S9 fraction from Aroclor-1254 induced rats or primary hepatocytes from both untreated and Aroclor-1254 pretreated rats.

All seven compounds were nonmutagenic in both bacterial tester strains. The addition of or 50-250 micrograms of sodium selenite, 5-50 mg of alpha-tocopherol or 50-250 microgram of BHT per plate inhibited DMAB-induced mutagenicity in TA98 and/or TA100.

At present these are the most widely used pyrazolone derivatives throughout the world. The widespread use of these drugs are of great concern for human health problems. In the present study these four drugs were tested in mutagenicity assays in Salmonella strains TA97a, TA98, TA100 and TA102 using a plate incorporation assay both with and without S-9 mix and for in vivo sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in bone marrow cells of mice. The first three drugs were negative in all the tester strains but dipyrone showed a weak mutagenic activity at higher concentrations in all four strains both with and without metabolic activation.

1480,"Allyl isothiocyanate, a naturally occurring compound, component of oil of mustard and human food plants such as cabbage, cauliflower and horseradish, has up to now been regarded as nonmutagenic in bacterial mutagenicity testing systems. Recently, however, it was found to cause transitional-cell papillomas in the urinary bladder of male F344 rats. Contrary to earlier reports, in this study allyl isothiocyanate showed clear mutagenicity for Salmonella typhimurium TA100 in the preincubation assay after longer, non-standard preincubation times (greater than 20 min). The mutagenicity is expressed only in the presence of a rat-liver homogenate metabolising system, i.e. it is indirect. However, high concentrations of rat-liver homogenate suppress the mutagenicity of allyl isothiocyanate. SKF525, inhibitor of microsomal oxygenase, reduces the mutagenic potential which on the other hand is increased in the presence of 1,1,1-trichloropropene-2-oxide, inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase. This indicates the occurrence of an epoxide intermediate in allyl isothiocyanate metabolism. Another metabolic pathway, namely hydrolysis to allyl alcohol and oxidation to acrolein, a known mutagen, also seems possible as cyanamide, inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase, can slightly increase the mutagenic potential. The reason(s) for allyl isothiocyanate's requirement for long preincubation times to express mutagenicity still requires elucidation, and the question arises: is allyl isothiocyanate a single, exceptional case or not?",Is Allyl isothiocyanate mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1481,"Mutagenic and clastogenic effects of some DNA damaging agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) have been demonstrated to exhibit a nonlinear or even ""thresholded"" dose-response in vitro and in vivo. DNA repair seems to be mainly responsible for these thresholds. To this end, we assessed several mutagenic alkylators in the Ames test with four different strains of Salmonella typhimurium: the alkyl transferases proficient strain TA1535 (Ogt+/Ada+), as well as the alkyl transferases deficient strains YG7100 (Ogt+/Ada-), YG7104 (Ogt-/Ada+) and YG7108 (Ogt-/Ada-). The known genotoxins EMS, MMS, temozolomide (TMZ), ethylnitrosourea (ENU) and methylnitrosourea (MNU) were tested in as many as 22 concentration levels. Dose-response curves were statistically fitted by the PROAST benchmark dose model and the Lutz-Lutz ""hockeystick"" model. These dose-response curves suggest efficient DNA-repair for lesions inflicted by all agents in strain TA1535. In the absence of Ogt, Ada is predominantly repairing methylations but not ethylations. It is concluded that the capacity of alkyl-transferases to successfully repair DNA lesions up to certain dose levels contributes to genotoxicity thresholds.",Is ENU mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
1482,"Lijinsky and his colleagues have reported that the N',N'-dimethyl analogues of ENU and MNU [N',N'-dimethyl-N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (DMENU) and trimethylnitrosourea (TMNU), respectively] are carcinogenic to rats despite their extreme hydrolytic stability which would reduce or preclude generation of alkylating species analogous to those formed upon hydrolysis of ENU and MNU. Lijinsky and his colleagues were unable to rationalize those activities of DMENU and TMNU despite extensive experimentation. We therefore decided to study this problem further. Whichever mode is accepted for the generation of electrophilic/mutagenic/carcinogenic reactive species from ENU and MNU, blocking of the free-NH2 group with methyl groups (-NMe2) should ablate or abolish activity. Consistent with this DMENU and TMNU gave negative results in the NBP alkylation test while the parent compounds gave an instantaneous deep blue coloration. Studies of the rate of hydrolysis of these four compounds revealed ENU and MNU to have half-lives of 8 min, while the alkylated analogues (DMENU and TMNU) had half-lives of 25 and 41 days, respectively. Hydrolysis of ENU and MNU, to yield the alkylating species, proceeds either via proton abstraction from the -NH2 group or by attack by water on the carbon of the carbonyl group. Methylation will inhibit both of these pathways, the first absolutely (no -NH2 protons) and the second partially, via steric inhibition. The slow hydrolysis observed for DMENU and TMNU suggests that the latter route of hydrolysis is applicable. Studies with strain TA1535 of Salmonella typhimurium (without S9 mix) confirmed the potent mutagenic activity for ENU and MNU (approximately 300-fold increase in revertants at 2,000 micrograms/plate and approximately 180-fold increase in revertants at 150 micrograms/plate respectively). In contrast, the methylated analogues showed only weak mutagenic activity (approximately 3-fold) at approximately 100-fold higher dose-levels. Addition of S9 mix did not affect the mutagenicity of DMENU or TMNU. To this point, hypothesis and data coincide. ENU and MNU are potent micronucleus-inducing agents to the mouse bone marrow, and given the above data, it was expected that DMENU and TMNU would show weak or no activity in that assay. In fact, the methylated analogues were as effective as ENU and MNU as clastogens to the mouse bone marrow. Four possible reasons for this conflict of theory and data are explored. The speculative explanation we favour for these effects is that the net alkylation of bone marrow DNA is the same for all four chemicals. With ENU and MNU, most of the alkylating activity is dissipated by rapid hydrolysis. Thus, only a small fraction of the administered dose survives to alkylate the bone marrow. Due to the enhanced stability of the methyl analogues most of the delivered dose will reach the bone marrow. However, because of their lower intrinsic reactivity, only a small fraction of the target dose will alkylate the bone marrow DNA during the time window of the experiment. If these opposing influences happen to balance out, the essentially identical bone marrow genetic toxicity for the four chemicals could be explained.",Is ENU mutagenic for TA1535 strain?,True
1483,"Several mutants with decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were isolated from the sensitive mutagen tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA100 after treatment with u.v. and selection for resistance to N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG) and its methyl analogue MNNG. Estimation of the GSH concentration and GSH S-transferase activity in extracts of these strains and of TA100 indicates that the GSH- derivatives contain 10-30% of the GSH level found in TA100, and that they exhibit normal GSH S-transferase activity. The mutagenic activities of 7 chemicals, namely, MNNG, ENNG, 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE), 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), styrene-7,8-oxide (STOX), N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) were compared in TA100 and in one representative GSH- strain, denominated NG-57. MNNG, ENNG, DBE and CDNB are potent to extremely potent mutagens in TA100, but induce very low levels of His+ mutants in NG-57. Pretreatment of NG-57 with 1 mM GSH (partially) restores the mutant yields to the levels usually found in TA100. The mutagenic activities of STOX, ENU and MMS are similar in both strains. These results support some previous findings, namely that ENNG, MNNG and DBE, but not ENU are activated to mutagens inside the test bacteria, and also suggest that CDNB is activated by bacterial GSH. The latter finding is in contrast with the current view that CDNB is detoxified by GSH, as is also presently evidenced by a strong reduction of the compound's mutagenicity in the presence of extracts of rat liver, which contains GSH and GSH S-transferase activity. The results with STOX indicate that GSH plays in bacteria a much less important role in the detoxification of xenobiotics than in mammalian tissue, presumably due to a much lower GSH S-transferase activity in the first organism.",Is ENU mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1484,"The mutagenicity of a series of 13 epoxide compounds was studied using a bacterial plate assay system. The histidine-dependent tester strains TA98 (for frameshift mutagens) and TA100 (for base-pair substitution mutagens) of Salmonella typhimurium were used.

Furthermore, their antitumor activity against adherent and suspended cells, namely, human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231), and human monocytes from histiocytic lymphoma (U-937), was investigated. The results demonstrated that GF reduced the viability and proliferation of NIH3T3 immortalized murine fibroblasts for concentrations >0.8 µg/mL and incubation times of 48 and 72 h. AGP showed no toxic effects in any of the tested concentrations and incubation times. The same results were obtained for MDA-MB-231 cells. The viability of the U-937 cells was not affected by either GF or AGP. The Ames test showed that GF and AGP were not genotoxic against  Salmonella typhimurium  strains TA98 and TA100, with and without metabolic activation. The present study demonstrated good in vitro cellular compatibility of GF and AGP and. Among these, AGP was the best material as it did not interfere, at any of the tested concentrations, with cell viability and proliferation for up to 72 h of incubation.

Since 2,4-DAPE is a close analogue of 2,4-diaminoanisole (2,4-DAA), which is mutagenic and carcinogenic, we tested this claim by assaying 2,4-DAPE for bacterial mutagenicity. Two samples of 2,4-DAPE X 2HCl were synthesized by reduction of the corresponding dinitrophenoxyethanol and identity and purity were established by elemental analysis, NMR spectrometry, mass-spectrometry, UV-spectrophotometry, TLC and HPLC. Fresh aqueous solutions of 2,4-DAPE X 2HCl were assayed in several separate plate tests using S. typhimurium TA1538, TA97, TA98 and TA100, and E. coli WP2uvrA (pKM101), 3 plates per dose and 0%, 4%, 10% and 30% Aroclor 1254-induced rat-liver S9 in S9 mixes. We obtained negative results in TA100 and E. coli. Reproducible, statistically significant dose-related increases in revertants (up to 14 times the background) were obtained in frame-shift mutants of S. typhimurium in the dose range 10-80 micrograms per plate. Mutagenicity was S9-dependent, significant increases in revertants being obtained only with 50 microliter per plate or more of S9. 2,4-DAPE induced significant mutagenic effects at doses of less than 1 micrograms per ml in TA1538 and TA98 in fluctuation tests using 2% S9 in the S9 mix. In plate tests, 2,4-DAPE was less mutagenic (by a factor of about 8) than 2,4-DAA, which gave the highest mutant yields with 20 microliter S9 per plate (4% S9 in the S9 mix). 2,4-DAPE obtained commercially was about 8 times more mutagenic than our sample of 2,4-DAPE. After purification, the commercial product, now chromatographically identical with our own sample, gave plate-test results close to those obtained for our samples of 2,4-DAPE. A review of the published reports (in which 2,4-DAPE was claimed to be inactive in a variety of short-term tests) revealed: (a) the use of protocols for bacterial mutagenicity testing which, in the light of our own results, were probably too limited in scope, especially in the choice of conditions for metabolic activation; (b) insufficient information on the identification and purity of the samples of 2,4-DAPE tested in the published collaborative study.","Is 2,4-DAA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or pKM101 or WP2uvrA strain?",True

A statistically significant increase in abnormal sperm morphology was detected in both CD1 and (BALB/cJ x DBA/2J) F1 mice. No drug-related effects on testis weight nor on sperm count were observed in either genotype. Urine samples obtained from niclosamide-treated F1 mice were assayed with the Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1538 both in the absence and presence of beta-glucuronidase. In the absence of glucuronidase, urine mutagenicity increased with increasing dose and the highest doses were toxic. In the presence of glucuronidase, urine mutagenicity and toxicity also increased. Only at the highest dose (120 mg/kg), however, was there a positive correlation between the urine mutagenic activity and an increase in the number of abnormal sperm. The results of this study suggest that the increase in abnormal sperm depends on the systemic presence of non-conjugated niclosamide metabolites.",Is Niclosamide mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

Here, the mutagenicity of the monomers, bisphenol A-diglycidyl dimethacrylate (Bis-GMA), urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA), Bisphenol A (BPA), glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), methyl methacrylate (MMA), and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) was studied in a bacterial (Ames test) and a mammalian gene mutation assay (V79/HPRT assay). Mutagenicity was determined in different Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102) and in V79 cells in the presence and in the absence of a metabolically active microsomal fraction from rat liver (S9). No mutagenic effects were observed with Bis-GMA and UDMA, methyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate and bisphenol A. Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) was mutagenic in a dose-dependent manner in three Salmonella tester strains. The number of mutants was increased by a factor of 2 to 3 with strains TA97a and TA102 in the absence of S9. Moreover, the numbers of mutants induced in S. typhimurium TA100 were about 8-fold higher than in solvent controls. GMA also induced an increase of mutants in V79 cells in the absence of S9. However, GMA was inactivated by microsomal enzymes. Triethylenglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) was not mutagenic in any S. typhimurium. In contrast, the compound induced a dose-dependent rise in mutant frequencies in V79 cell cultures. It is concluded that TEGDMA acted through a clastogenic mechanism which is not detected by Ames tester strains.",Is HEMA mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
1493,"Phenylglycidyl ether (1,2-epoxy-3-phenoxy propane) (PGE) was tested for genetic activity in bacterial and mammalian tests. It was active in the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test. Concentration-dependent mutagenicity was demonstrated in S. typhimurium strains TA1535 and TA100 with and without rat S9, but not in strains TA98, TA1537, or TA1538. These results suggest PGE, is a direct-acting mutagen causing base substitutions. Phenylglycidyl ether did not induce 6-thioguanine-resistant mutants of Chinese hamster ovary cells, with or without rat S9, and with or without serum in the medium. Dose-dependent enhancement of SA7 virus transformation of primary hamster embryo cells was observed at concentrations of 1.6 microgram/ml and higher. In addition, this compound was able to chemically transform secondary hamster embryo cells at concentrations of 6.2 micrograms/ml and higher. At a dose of 2500 mg/kg p.o., PGE was active in the host-mediated assay using C57B1/6 X C3H mice and S. typhimurium strain TA1535. This activity represented a positive response in 2 of 5 animals tested. Murine testicular DNA synthesis was not inhibited by oral administration of PGE at 500 mg/kg.",Is PGE mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
1494,"14 pesticides were tested as pure compounds for the induction of point mutations in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium--TA1535, TA1536, TA1537 and TA1538--in the presence and in the absence of rat-liver microsomal fractions and for the induction of resistance to low concentrations of streptomycin in the filamentous bacterium, Streptomyces coelicolor. The technique used was essentially the so-called ""spot test"". The pesticides investigated were: aminotriazole, Benomyl, Captafol, Captan, Dichlorvos, Dalapon-Na, Dinobuton, Dodine, Ioxynil, Mecoprop, Neburon, Picloram, Triallate and Trichlorphon. In Salmonella, Captan and Triallate were mutagenic on the TA1535 strain; Dichlorvos and Trichlorphon were negative in the spot test but mutagenic after incubation in liquid cultures of strain TA1535. By using the S. coelicolor forward-mutation test, aminotriazole, Dichlorvos, Picloram, Trichlorphon and Triallate were mutagenic with the ""spot test"" technique; Captan showed a weak mutagenic activity with a ""plate-incorporated"" technique.",Is Trichlorphon mutagenic for TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,False
1495,"Thirty-seven azo, xanthene and triphenylmethane dyes including FD and C colors currently approved for use in the U.S.A. and a number of delisted food colors, were tested in the Salmonella/microsome system. In addition to direct plate tests with five tester strains (TA1535, TA100, TA1537, TA1538, TA98), the azo dyes were also assayed after chemical reduction to their component amines. Also, a selected group of azo dyes was subjected to liquid tests (both aerobic with microsomes and anaerobic) and to plate tests involving initial 16 h anaerobic incubations to facilitate microbial reduction of the azo bond. None of the presently listed FD and C colors was mutagenic in any of the test modifications. Among formerly listed colors only Butter Yellow (p-dimethylaminoazobenzene), a recognized animal carcinogen, was mutagenic in the aerobic liquid test. Several other azo dyes were either directly mutagenic,  viz. Acid Alizarin Yellow R and Alizarin Yellow GG; required microsomal activation, viz. Acid Alizarin Red B and Methyl Red; or required chemical reduction and microsomal activation, viz. Acid Alizarin Violet N and Sudan IV.

1496,"Since the herbicide propanil (3,4-dichloropropionanilide) is an aromatic amide and many other aromatic amides are genotoxic via N-hydroxy (N-OH) metabolites, N-oxidized derivatives of propanil and 3,4-dichloroaniline were synthesized and tested for genotoxicity. Propanil 3,4-dichloroaniline, and their N-OH derivatives were not mutagenic in the Salmonella typhimurium reversion assay using tester strains TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA104, in both the presence and absence of exogenous metabolic activation (S9). In addition, the test compounds were not mutagenic in the Chinese hamster ovary/hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (CHO/HGPRT) assay, in both the presence and absence of S9. 3,3',4,4'-Tetrachloroazobenzene (TCAB) and its azoxy derivative (TCAOB), which are synthetic contaminants and/or degradation products of propanil, were also inactive in the S. typhimurium reversion and CHO/HGPRT assays (+/- S9). Unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assays were performed to determine if propanil derivatives were able to induce DNA damage in primary rat hepatocytes. Although TCAB was the only derivative tested which induced an elevation in DNA repair, the extent was not statistically significant. Hepatocyte toxicity, as measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase 24 hr after exposure, was induced by all the test compounds in a concentration-dependent manner. Incubations of [14C]N-OH-3,4-dichloroaniline with DNA in vitro resulted in only a low level of binding that was not affected by pH. This observation may partially explained the lack of mutagenicity observed in genotoxicity assays with propanil derivatives.",Is TCAB mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1497,"The combination of chemical analyses and bioassays allows the identification of potentially mutagenic compounds in different types of samples. Dyes can be considered as emergent contaminants and were detected in waters, under the influence of textile activities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of 9 azo dyes to the mutagenicity of representative environmental samples. Samples were collected along one year in the largest conglomerate of textile industries of Brazil. We analyzed water samples from an important water body, Piracicaba River, upstream and downstream two main discharges, the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the tributary Quilombo River, which receives untreated effluent from local industries. Samples were analyzed using a LC-MS/MS and tested for mutagenicity in the Salmonella/microsome microsuspension assay with TA98 and YG1041. Six dyes were detected in the collected samples, Disperse Blue 291, Disperse Blue 373, Disperse Orange 30, Disperse Red 1, Disperse Violet 93, and Disperse Yellow 3. The most sensitive condition for the detection of the mutagenicity was the strain YG1041 with S9. The concentration of dyes and mutagenicity levels varied along time and the dry season represented the worst condition. Disperse Blue 373 and Disperse Violet 93 were the major contributors to the mutagenicity. We conclude that dyes are contributing for the mutagenicity of Piracicaba River water; and both discharges, WWTP effluent and Quilombo River, increase the mutagenicity of Piracicaba River waters in about 10-fold. The combination of chemical analysis and bioassays were key in the identification the main drivers of the water mutagenicity and allows the selection of priority compounds to be included in monitoring programs as well for the enforcing actions required to protect the water quality for multiple uses.",Is Disperse Violet 93 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1498,"Emodin is a naturally occurring anthraquinone present in the roots and bark of numerous plants of the genus Rhamnus. Extracts from the roots, bark, and/or dried leaves of buckthorn, senna, cascara, aloe, frangula, and rhubarb have been used as laxatives since ancient times and currently are widely used in the preparation of herbal laxative preparations. Anthraquinone glycosides are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but are cleaved by gut bacteria to produce aglycones (such as emodin) that are more readily absorbed and are responsible for the purgative properties of these preparations. There is extensive exposure to emodin and other anthraquinones resulting from the use of herb-based stimulant laxatives. Reports that 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone, a commonly used laxative ingredient, caused tumors in the gastrointestinal tract of rats raised the possibility of an association between colorectal cancer and the use of laxatives containing anthraquinones. Because emodin is a hydroxyanthraquinone structurally similar to 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone, is present in herbal laxatives, and was reported to be mutagenic in bacteria, it was considered a potential carcinogen and was selected for in-depth evaluation. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to emodin (at least 94% pure) in feed for 16 days, 14 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, rat and mouse bone marrow cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 16-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Groups of five male and five female rats were fed diets containing 0, 600, 2,000, 5,500, 17,000, or 50,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 50, 170, 480, 1,400, or 3,700 mg emodin/kg body weight to males and 50, 160, 460, 1,250, or 2,000 mg/kg to females) for 15 (males) or 16 (females) days. Three female rats died before the end of the study. Mean body weights of males and females exposed to 5,500 ppm or greater were significantly less than those of the controls. Feed consumption by males and females receiving 17,000 or 50,000 ppm was decreased throughout the study. Macroscopic lesions were present in the kidney of rats exposed to 17,000 or 50,000 ppm. 16-DAY STUDY IN MICE: Groups of five male and five female mice were fed diets containing 0, 600, 2,000, 5,500, 17,000, or 50,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 120, 400, 1,200, or 3,800 mg/kg to males and 140, 530, 1,600, or 5,000 mg/kg to females; 50,000 ppm equivalents were not calculated due to high mortality) for 15 (males) or 16 (females) days. All mice exposed to 50,000 ppm died before the end of the study. Mice in the 17,000 ppm groups lost weight during the study. Feed consumption by 5,500 ppm females was greater than that by the controls throughout the study. Macroscopic lesions were present in the gallbladder and kidney of mice exposed to 17,000 ppm. 14-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 312.5, 625, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 20, 40, 80, 170, or 300 mg/kg to males and females) for 14 weeks. Mean body weights of males exposed to 2,500 ppm or greater and females exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater were significantly less than those of the controls. During the first week of the study, feed consumption by males exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm and females exposed to 5,000 ppm was less than that by the controls. Feed consumption by these groups was similar to that by the controls for the remainder of the study. In rats exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm, there were increases in platelet counts in males and females and segmented neutrophil counts in females. Total serum protein and albumin concentrations were decreased in females exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm. Relative kidney weights of rats exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater and relative lung weights of rats exposed to 625 ppm or greater were significantly increased compared to the control groups. Relative liver weights were incree increased in females exposed to 625 ppm or greater. The estrous cycle length wassignificantly increased in females exposed to 1,250 or 5,000 ppm. All male rats exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater and all exposed female rats had pigment in the renal tubules; and the severity of pigmentation generally increased with increasing exposure concentration. The incidences of hyaline droplets in the cortical epithelial cytoplasm were increased in all groups of exposed males and in females exposed to 312.5, 625, or 1,250 ppm. 14-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were fed diets containing 0, 312.5, 625, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approxi mately 50, 100, 190, 400, or 800 mg/kg to males and 60, 130, 240, 500, or 1,100 mg/kg to females) for 14 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. Mean body weights of males exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm were significantly less than those of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed groups was generally similar to that by the controls. Relative kidney weights of male mice exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater, relative lung weights of males exposed to 625 ppm or greater, and relative liver weights of female mice exposed to 625 ppm or greater were increased. The incidences and severities of nephropathy were increased in males and females exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater. The incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in males exposed to 625 ppm or greater and in females exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 65 male and 65 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 280, 830, or 2,500 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 110, 320, or 1,000 mg/kg to males and 120, 370, or 1,100 mg/kg to females) for 105 weeks. Ten male and ten female rats from each group were necropsied at 6 months. Blood samples from five male and five female rats in each group were evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months for plasma emodin concentrations; these rats were necropsied at 12 months. Survival, Body Weights, and Feed Consumption: Survival of exposed males and females was similar to that of the controls. The mean body weights of rats in the 2,500 ppm groups were less than those of the controls beginning at week 2 of the study. Feed consumption by exposed groups was similar to that by the controls throughout the study. Pathology Findings: Three Zymbal's gland carcinomas were observed in female rats exposed to 2,500 ppm. This incidence exceeded the range observed for current historical controls and was considered an equivocal finding. At the 6- and 12-month interim evaluations and at 2 years, emodin-related increases in the incidences of renal tubule hyaline droplets occurred in all exposed groups. The incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males at 2 years. There were negative trends in the incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats, and the incidences in the 2,500 ppm groups were significantly decreased. In females exposed to 2,500 ppm, the incidence was below the historical control range; the incidence in males exposed to 2,500 ppm was at the lower end of the historical control range. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 60 male mice were fed diets containing 0, 160, 312, or 625 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 15, 35, or 70 mg/kg) for 105 weeks. Groups of 60 female mice were fed diets containing 0, 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 30, 60, or 120 mg/kg) for 105 weeks. Ten male and ten female mice from each group were necropsied at 12 months. Survival, Body Weights, and Feed Consumption Survival and mean body weights of exposed males and females were similar to those of the controls. No differences in feed consumption were noted between exposed and control groups. Pathology Findings: Low incidences of renal tubule adenoma and carcinoma occurred in exposed male mice; these incidences included one carcinoma each in the 312 and 625 ppm groups. Renal tubule neoplasms are rare in male mice, and their presence in these groups suggested a possible association with emodin exposure. At the 12-month interim evaluation, the severity of nephropathy was slightly increased in males exposed to 625 ppm. Also at 12 months, the severity of nephropathy increased from minimal in the lower exposure groups to mild in females exposed to 1,250 ppm; the incidence in this group was significantly increased compared to the control group. At 2 years, the severities of nephropathy were slightly increased in males exposed to 625 ppm and females exposed to 1,250 ppm. The incidences of nephropathy were significantly increased in all exposed groups of females. At the 12-month interim evaluation, the incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males and in females exposed to 625 or 1,250 ppm. The severities increased with increasing exposure concentration. At 2 years, the incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in all exposed groups; severities increased with increasing exposure concentration. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Emodin was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 in the presence of S9 activation; no mutagenicity was detected in strain TA98, with or without S9. Chromosomal aberrations were induced in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells treated with emodin, with and without S9. Three separate in vivo micronucleus tests were performed with emodin. A male rat bone marrow micronucleus test, with emodin administered by three intraperitoneal injections, gave negative results. Results of acute-exposure (intraperitoneal injection) micronucleus tests in bone marrow and peripheral blood erythrocytes of male and female mice were negative. In a peripheral blood micronucleus test on mice from the 14-week study, negative results were seen in male mice, but a weakly positive response was observed in similarly exposed females. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in male F344/N rats exposed to 280, 830, or 2,500 ppm. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in female F344/N rats based on a marginal increase in the incidence of Zymbal's gland carcinoma. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in male B6C3F1 mice based on a low incidence of uncommon renal tubule neoplasms. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in female B6C3F1 mice exposed to 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm. Exposure of rats to emodin resulted in increased incidences of renal tubule hyaline droplets and pigmentation in males, increased incidences of renal tubule hyaline droplets in females, and increased severities of renal tubule pigmentation in males and females. Emodin exposure resulted in increased incidences of renal tubule pigmentation in male and female mice and increased incidences of nephropathy in female mice. Incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia decreased in male and female rats exposed to 2,500 ppm. Synonyms: Archin; C.I. 75440; C.I. Natural Green 2; C.I.

1501,"Two dyes (C.I. Solvent Yellow No. 33 and a mixture of C.I. Solvent Yellow No. 33 and C.I. Solvent Green No. 3) were tested for mutagenicity in the Salmonella reversion assay and the L5178Y/TK+/- mouse lymphoma assay, and also for sister chromatid exchange (SCE) induction in vivo in C57B1/6J mice. In addition, a greater than 99.9% pure sample of the yellow dye [2-(2'-quinolyl)-1,3-indandione] was tested with and without exogenous activation in the Salmonella reversion assay and the L5178Y/TK+/- mouse lymphoma assay. Neither C.I. Solvent Yellow No. 33 nor the C.I. Solvent Yellow No. 33 and Solvent Green No. 3 mixture was positive for inducing SCEs in vivo. All three dyes were tested in the standard plate incorporation test in seven Salmonella strains TA98, TA100, TA102, TA104, TA1535, TA1537, and TA1538. The dyes were negative with and without exogenous activation in TA98, TA1535, and TA1538. One test with TA1537 was positive with the greater than 99.9% purified yellow dye. All three dyes gave weakly positive results (less than a twofold increase) with S-9 in TA100 and were clearly positive in TA102 and TA104 both with and without S-9. They also induced mutation at the thymidine kinase locus in mouse lymphoma cells, produced both large- and small-colony trifluorothymidine-resistant mutants, and were clastogenic.

1502,"Paper strips containing indicator dyes have been developed by defence scientists to change color upon exposure to certain agents but not to common solvents. As a preliminary step in studies on their possible genetic or carcinogenic hazard, 6 dyes used in these detection papers were tested with the Salmonella/mammalian-microsome assay. The 3 nitro arenes tested were found to be mutagenic. Two of them, Orasol Navy Blue 2RB (without metabolic activation) and Eastman Fast Blue B-GLF (with metabolic activation), induced higher yields of mutations in the frameshift revertible strains, but base substitution mutations also were found. The third nitro arene, ethyl-bis-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) acetate, induced only frameshift reversions, the greatest yields without metabolic activation. Because of weak but consistent mutagenic activation. Because of weak but consistent mutagenic effects with a fourth dye, thiodiphenyl-4,4'-diazo-bis-salicylic acid, fluctuation tests using Salmonella strain TA98 were performed, and dose-related, statistically-significant mutagenic responses were observed. Two remaining dyes, Fluorescent Brilliant Yellow R and 2,5,2',5'-tetramethyltriphenylmethane-4,4'-diazo-bis-beta-hydroxynaphthoic anilide, were not mutagenic in experiments using doses extending into the toxic range. Spot tests were performed on different paper strips containing the dyes. When the papers were eluted with dimethyl sulfoxide, responses were found to be qualitatively similar to those in the plate tests. Although microbial test results cannot be used to assess risk in man, these results indicate a potential mutagenic or carcinogenic hazard for individuals exposed to these dyes, especially the nitro aromatics.",Is Fluorescent Brilliant Yellow R mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False

1504,"Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) rank among the strongest known mutagens. Approximately 30 HAAs have been found in cooked foods (broiled, fried, and grilled) and several HAAs have been characterized as animal carcinogens. Nine HAAs have also been reported to be constituents of cigarette smoke (CS) raising concerns that HAAs might contribute significantly to the known carcinogenicity of CS. As HAAs are found predominantly in the total particulate matter (TPM) of CS, an improved method for the quantification of HAAs in TPM is reported allowing detection and quantification of 8 HAAs in a single run. The mutagenic potency of these HAAs and that of TPM from the reference cigarette 2R4F was determined in the Salmonella Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames assay) with tester strain TA98 and a metabolic activation system. The 8 HAAs, when applied together in the Ames assay, showed a clear sub-additive response. Likewise, the combination of HAAs and TPM, if at all, gave rise to a slight sub-additive response. In both cases, however, the sub-additive response in the Ames assay was observed at HAA doses that are far above the amounts found in CS. The contribution of the individual HAAs to the total mutagenic activity of TPM was calculated and experimentally confirmed to be approximately 1% of the total mutagenic activity. Thus, HAAs do not contribute significantly to the bacterial in vitro mutagenicity of CS TPM. ",Is HAA mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1505,"The TNO gastro-Intestinal tract Model (TIM) is a dynamic computer-controlled in vitro system that mimics the human physiological conditions in the stomach and small intestine. In the current TIM physiological parameters such as pH, temperature, peristaltic movements, secretion of digestion enzymes, bile and pancreatic juices, and absorption of digested products-by removal through dialysis-was simulated. Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAA; viz. IQ, MeIQ, MeIQx and PhIP) were used as model compounds for food mutagens, and the passage through TIM was investigated for each of these compounds separately. Subsequently, the influence of a matrix and different rates of passage on the availability for absorption and distribution were studied in experiments with prepared meat, supplemented with MeIQx. Samples taken at various time points from the jejunal and ileal dialysates and from the lumen at the end of the small intestine (ileal delivery) were tested for the presence of mutagenic activity in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 as indicator, in the presence of mammalian metabolic activation (rat S9 mix). The results show that, comparable with the human in vivo situation, all four HAA are quickly removed (approx. 50% in 2 hr; approx. 95% in 6 hr) and mainly recovered from the lumen into the jejunal and ileal dialysates (94% of recovery). Only 5+/-1.5% is recovered in the chyme at the end of the small intestine. When MeIQx was added to meat, its availability for absorption was slower, although the influence of the gastrointestinal passage time on the availability of MeIQx was more pronounced than this matrix effect. More MeIQx was found in the jejunal dialysate (23%; P<0.01) and less in the ileal delivery (8%; P<0.01) when simulating the gastrointestinal passage of solid meals was compared to simulating that of liquid meals. The present experiments demonstrate that TIM can be applied to study in vitro the availability of heterocyclic aromatic amines in the gastrointestinal tract. More generally, these studies indicate that TIM shows promise as a useful tool for various research purposes dealing with the availability for absorption of mutagenic as well as antimutagenic components in food.",Is HAA mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1506,"Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) are potent bacterial mutagens and potential human carcinogens formed in heat processed proteins. The Ames test (strain TA98) is a useful mutagenicity test system to screen food products for these compounds. HAAs require activation to their genotoxic forms, and in the Ames test, a rat liver S-9 preparation is normally used. In order to better understand the mechanisms of mutagen activation with respect to human metabolism, new bacterial strains containing human cytochrome P450s and other metabolic enzymes have recently been developed. We have investigated the capacity of one of these strains, DJ4309 [Josephy et al., Chem. Res. Toxicol. 11 (1998) 70-74] as a screening tool for mutagens in food products. DJ4309 expresses the human P450 1A2, human NADPH cytochrome reductase and the bacterial acetyl CoA:arylamine N-acetyltransferase. This strain is as sensitive as the Ames system to the mutagenic effects of the heterocyclic aromatic amines 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline, 2-amino-3, 4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4, 5-f]quinoxaline, but less sensitive to 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine. However, the mutagenicity of the arylamine 2-aminofluorene is considerably higher in DJ4309 than in the Ames test system. Meat extracts with a total HAA content ranging from less than 2 ng/g to 20 ng/g are efficiently detected by the Ames TA98 strain with rat liver S-9 activation. DJ4309 is less sensitive, with fewer revertants induced over the same dose range. Unknown compounds present in the meat extracts appear to inhibit the activity of the P450 1A2 enzyme in the DJ4309 strain. We have therefore demonstrated that although DJ4309 is a useful tool for mechanistic studies in chemical carcinogenesis, the screening of complex food matrices for HAAs by this bacterial strain must be conducted with caution.",Is HAA mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1507,"Water extracts of eight brands (five types: 'green', 'black', 'oolong', decaffeinated and instant) of common teas (derived from Camellia sinensis) and infusions of six randomly selected herbal teas were examined for inhibitory or potentiating effects on the mutagenicity of eight heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAA) using the Ames Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and S-9 assay. HAA, produced in foods during regular heat processing of meat, exhibit mutagenic/carcinogenic activities. Tea extracts from C. sinensis displayed very potent antimutagenic effects against most HAA: total or substantial inhibition of mutagenic activity of the eight HAA was obtained with extracts equivalent to 50 mg tea leaves/plate (mgEq) and potent inhibition was frequently achieved even with 10 mgEq/plate. Decaffeinated tea produced the same effect as observed for 'regular' teas. However, lower concentrations of some tea extracts enhanced mutagenic activity of 2-amino-3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (4,7,8-TriMeIQx) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2). Herbal tea extracts displayed variable effects on the mutagenicity of different HAA. While some extracts had no effect, others exhibited a moderate inhibitory effect on the mutagenicity of IQ-type HAA. In contrast to common tea, herbal teas showed substantial potentiating effects on the mutagenicity of several HAA, especially Trp-P-2 and 4,7,8-TriMeIQx.",Is HAA mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1508,"Dietary casein cooked at 180 degrees C promotes the growth of aberrant crypt foci and colon cancer in rats initiated with azoxymethane. We speculated that promotion was due to a product that could be extracted by a solvent, such as 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF), with tumor- promoting activity or the carcinogenic heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAA). This hypothesis was tested by extracting cooked casein with solvents and water. The extracts were then 1) assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography for HMF and HAA, 2) measured for mutagenicity on a frame-shift-sensitive strain of Salmonella typhimurium, and 3) fed for 100 days to azoxymethane-initiated rats to test the promoting effect on aberrant crypt foci. Data show that 1) no HMF or HAA was detected in cooked casein, 2) no mutagenicity was detected on strain TA98, with or without metabolic activation, and 3) promotion was not associated with the extracts but with the cooked casein residue. Therefore the promotion by cooked casein would not appear to be associated with a product that can be extracted by solvents.",Is cooked casein mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False

1510,"Commercially available rice grains in Thailand were examined to isolate the monoverticillate  Penicillium  species responsible for toxic yellowed rice.  Penicillium  species were obtained from seven out of 10 rice samples tested. Among them, one  Penicillium citreonigrum  isolate and six  Penicillium brocae  isolates were morphologically identified. The  P. citreonigrum  isolate produced the mycotoxin citreoviridin on a yeast extract sucrose broth medium. Mycotoxin surveys showed that citreoviridin was not detected in any samples, but one out of 10 rice samples tested was positive for aflatoxin B₁ at a level of 5.9 μg/kg. An Ames test revealed that methanol extracts from rice grains inoculated with selected  P. brocae  isolates were positive for strains TA100 and YG7108 of  Salmonella typhimurium , suggesting the presence of base-pair substitution and DNA alkylation mutagens. Our data obtained here demonstrated that aflatoxin B₁ and toxic  P. citreonigrum  were present on domestic rice grains in Thailand, although limited samples were tested.

1513,"Cigarette filters pose a serious litter and toxic waste disposal problem, because of their not biodegradability and to the leaching of toxins in the environment. Therefore, cigarette butts need to be manipulated as special waste, with potential risks to human health and environment. In the present study, the genotoxic potential of a methanol extract from commonly discharged cigarette butts (CBE) was evaluated in the bacterial reverse mutation assay on Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 and Escherichia coli WP2uvrA strains, both in the absence and presence of the S9 exogenous metabolic activator. Furthermore, the ability of the natural sesquiterpenes β-caryophyllene (CRY) and β-caryophyllene oxide (CRYO) to inhibit the mutagenicity of CBE was studied as a possible preventive strategy. In order to identify the potential antimutagenic mechanisms, three different protocols (pretreatment, cotreatment, and posttreatment) were applied. CBE showed to increase the number of revertant colonies in all the strains tested in presence of S9, so resulting mutagenic. In the antimutagenicity assay, both CRY and CRYO significantly reduced the revertant colonies induced by CBE, although with different potency and specificity. For both sesquiterpenes, the antimutagenicity was strong in all experimental conditions, except for the cotreatment of CRY with CBE in WP2uvrA, which produced a moderate inhibition. Both desmutagenic and bioantimutagenic mechanisms seem to be involved in the antimutagenicity of the test substances. Taking into account the potential genotoxicity of cigarette butts, CRY and CRYO appear as possible further candidates as environmental decontaminants against this hazardous waste. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

(Fabaceae) was investigated by employing Ames assay and DNA nicking assay. DNA damage by hydroxyl radicals was effectively inhibited by all the extract/fractions. A marked antimutagenic effect was observed against 4-Nitro-o-phenylenediamine and sodium azide (direct acting mutagens) and 2-Aminofluorene (indirect acting mutagen) in TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium. In Ames assay, two different modes of experiments i.e. pre-incubation and co-incubation were performed and it was observed that all the extract/fractions showed better results in the pre-incubation as compared to co- incubation mode. Out of all the extract/fractions tested, n-butanol fraction was found to be the most effective in preventing DNA damage and inhibiting mutagenesis. UHPLC analysis of extract/fractions revealed presence of polyphenols such as gallic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, umbelliferone, coumaric acid, rutin, and ellagic acid etc. DNA protecting and antimutagenic activity of this plant could be attributed to presence of these polyphenols.

Jacobaea vulgaris, common or tansy ragwort) test positive in the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test (Ames test). Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are thought to be responsible for these mutagenic effects. However, it was also observed that the major PA present in common ragwort, jacobine, produced a negative response (with and without the addition of rat liver S9) in Salmonella test strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537. To investigate which compounds in the plant extracts were responsible for the positive outcome, the present study investigated the contents and mutagenic effects of methanol and acetone extracts prepared from dried ground S. jacobaea and Senecio inaequidens (narrow-leafed ragwort). Subsequently, a fractionation approach was set up in combination with LC-MS/MS analysis of the fractions. It was shown that the positive Ames test outcomes of S. jacobaea extracts are unlikely to be caused by PAs, but rather by the flavonoid quercetin.

This study evaluated the mutagenic and antimutagenic properties of hydrophilic and lipophilic components of purple rice using the Ames test. The seed and hull of purple rice were extracted with hexane, methanol, ethanol, and water. The methanol extracts had the highest amounts of phenolic acids and flavonoids, while the hexane extracts contained large amount of tocols and γ-oryzanol. None of the extracts were mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. The hexane extract of rice hull and the methanol extract of rice seed were strongly effective against aflatoxin B1- and 2-amino-3, 4 dimethylimidazo (4, 5-f) quinoline-induced mutagenesis, while aqueous extracts showed weakly antimutagenic properties. All extracts with the exception of aqueous extracts enhanced the number of revertant colonies from benzo (a) pyrene induced-mutagenesis. None of the extracts inhibited mutagenesis induced by the direct mutagens 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-acrylamide and sodium azide. The hull extracts showed more potent antimutagenicity than the seed extracts. Based on a chemical analysis, γ-oryzanol and γ-tocotrienol in the hull and cyanidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside in the seed are candidate antimutagens in purple rice. The antimutagenic mechanisms of purple rice might be related to either modulation of mutagen metabolizing enzymes or direct attack on electrophiles.

Hence, the aim of this study was to assess the estrogenicity and mutagenic and antimutagenic properties. We used recombinant yeast assay (RYA), with the strain BY4741 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Ames test, with strains TA100, TA98, TA97a and TA102 of Salmonella typhimirium, to evaluate estrogenicity, mutagenicity and antimutagenicity of methanolic extracts of Syngonanthus dealbatus (S.d.), Syngonanthus macrolepsis (S.m.), Syngonanthus nitens (S.n.) and Syngonanthus suberosus (S.s.), and of 9 compounds isolated from them (1=luteolin, 2=mix of A-1,3,6-trihydroxy-2-methoxyxanthone and B-1,3,6-trihydroxy-2,5-dimethoxyxanthone, 3=1,5,7-trihydroxy-3,6-dimethoxyxanthone, 4=1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxy-2,5-dimethoxyxanthone, 5=1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxy-5-methoxyxanthone, 6=7-methoxyluteolin-8-C-β-glucopyranoside, 7=7-methoxyluteolin-6-C-β-glucopyranoside, 8=7,3'-dimethoxyluteolin-6-C-β-glucopyranoside and 9=6-hydroxyluteolin).

These extracts from leaf parts of N. retusa showed no mutagenicity either with or without the metabolic enzyme preparation (microsome fraction). The highest protection against methylmethanesulfonate induced mutagenicity was observed with chloroform and methanol extracts with inhibition percentages of 44.93% (at 50 microg/plate in the presence of TA102 strain) and 38% (at 10 microg/plate in the presence of TA104 strain), respectively. Whereas Hexane and chloroform extracts reduced the mutagenicity induced by 2-aminoanthracene by 83.4% (using the S. typhimurium TA104 assay system) and 65.3% (using the S. typhimurium TA 102 assay system), respectively. Antioxidant activity of N. retusa extracts was determined by the ability of each extract to protect plasmid DNA against strand scission induced by hydroxyl radicals. Chloroform extract exhibited the highest ability to protect plasmid DNA against hydroxyl radical induced DNA damages and exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity, with 0.95mM trolox equivalent when tested by the ferric reducing/antioxidant method.",Is extract of N. retusa mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False
1527,"The ajowain (Carum copticum (L.)) is a popular spice and traditionally used in Indian system of medicine. Considering the importance of natural products in modern phytomedicine, the antioxidant and antimutagenic activities of C. copticum fruits extract and its fractions were evaluated. The methanol fraction showed highest antioxidant activity by phosphomolybdenum (2087.7 micromol) and DPPH assay (90.2%) followed by other fractions comparable to ascorbic acid and BHT. Based on antioxidant activity, methanol fraction was evaluated for antimutagenic potential against direct acting mutagens sodium azide (NaN(3)) and methyl methane sulphonate (MMS) and indirect acting mutagens 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) and benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), using Salmonella typhimurium (TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA102) tester strains. The methanolic fraction showed no sign of mutagenicity at tested concentrations (25-100 microg/plate). Antimutagenic activity was recorded with inhibition of mutagenicity ranging from 10.8% to 83.1% in a concentration dependent manner. The phytochemical analysis by IR, HPLC, GC-MS, and total phenolic assay revealed a high content of phenolic terpenoids.

1528,"Particulates exhausted from two types of diesel engines (DEPs), burning-derived particulates from three types of coal (CBPs) and burning-derived particulates from three types of wood (WBPs) were separated into four fractions by silica-gel column chromatography using n-hexane, n-hexane-dichloromethane (3:1, v/v), dichloromethane and methanol, as the corresponding eluents. The indirect-acting mutagenicity of each fraction was assayed by the Ames test using the Salmonella typhimurium TA100 strain with S9 mix and the direct-acting mutagenicity was assayed using the S. typhimurium TA98 strain without S9 mix. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs) of each fraction were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Both direct- and indirect-acting of mutagenicities were the highest in samples of DEPs.

1529,"Euphorbia hirta (E. hirta) is a weed commonly found in tropical countries and has been used traditionally for asthma, bronchitis and conjunctivitis. However, one of the constituents in this plant, quercetin, was previously reported to be mutagenic. This work aimed to determine the level of quercetin in the aqueous and methanol plant extracts and to investigate the mutagenic effects of quercetin and the extracts in the Ames test utilising the mutant Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains. The antimutagenic activity of Euphorbia hirta aqueous and methanol extracts was also studied in Salmonella typhimurium TA98. HPLC analyses showed that quercetin and rutin, a glycosidic form of quercetin, were present in the acid-hydrolysed methanol extract and non-hydrolysed methanol extract respectively. The quercetin concentration was negligible in both non-hydrolysed and acid-hydrolysed aqueous extracts. The total phenolic contents in Euphorbia hirta were determined to be 268 and 93 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram of aqueous and methanol extracts, respectively. Quercetin (25 microg/mL) was found to be strongly mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the absence and presence of S-9 metabolic activation. However, both the aqueous and methanol extracts did not demonstrate any mutagenic properties when tested with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains at concentrations up to 100 microg/mL in the absence and presence of S-9 metabolic activation. In the absence of S-9 metabolic activation, both the extracts were unable to inhibit the mutagenicity of the known mutagen, 2-nitrofluorene, in Salmonella typhimurium TA98. On the other hand, the aqueous extracts at 100 microg/mL and methanol extracts at 10 and 100 microg/mL exhibited strong antimutagenic activity against the mutagenicity of 2-aminoanthracene, a known mutagen, in the presence of S-9 metabolic activating enzymes.

1530,"Hypsizigus marmoreus has recently become a popular edible mushroom in Asia. Despite its extensive use, the underlying mechanisms of the anticarcinogenic effects on the initiation stage are not precisely known. Therefore, methanol extracts from H. marmoreus were prepared and then tested for antiproliferative effects in cancer cells and antimutagenic activities as well as mutagenic capacity using the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity test. In addition, the effects on the phase I drug metabolizing enzymes, phase II detoxifying enzymes, and antioxidative activities were evaluated in livers from mice pretreated with methanol extracts from H. marmoreus and challenged with benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). In the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, methanol extracts from H. marmoreus displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect against human hepatocarcinoma and colon carcinoma cells. However, equivalent doses did not induce mutagenicity when tested with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 while exhibiting antimutagenicity against direct-acting and indirect-acting mutagens. Methanol extracts from H. marmoreus strongly decreased total cytochrome P450 and activity of ethoxyresorufin deethylase after B[a]P challenge. Further investigation revealed that methanol extracts from H. marmoreus decreased protein levels of cytochrome P450 IAI isozyme induced by B[a]P. Methanol extracts from H. marmoreus increased the content of glutathione and activity of glutathione S-transferase. This also induced the activity of quinone reductase, an enzyme well known to be anticarcinogenic. The results of the present study therefore demonstrated that methanol extracts from H. marmoreus may have antimutagenic effects, inhibiting the mutagenicity of some mutagens, particularly indirect-acting B[a]P. The mechanism of this antimutagenicity may be the induction of the activity of phase II enzymes, as well as the ability to reduce phase I metabolic-activating enzymes in mouse liver.",Is methanol extracts from H. marmoreus mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1531,"For centuries, plants have been used in traditional medicines, and there has been recent interest in the chemopreventive properties of compounds derived from plants. In the present study, we investigated the free-radical-scavenging, antioxidant, and antimutagenic potential of polar extracts from Phlomis crinita Cav. flowers. Ethyl acetate, chloroform, and methanol extracts were prepared from powdered Phlomis flowers and characterized for the presence of tannins, flavonoids, iridoids, sterols, cardiac glycosides, and anthraquinones. All the extracts showed increased activity in scavenging the ABTS free radical, but only ethyl acetate and methanol extracts were active in scavenging the superoxide anion generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system. In addition, all the extracts significantly decreased the mutagenicity induced by 2-aminoanthracene in the presence of a metabolizing homogenate (S9) and methyl methane sulfonate in the absence of metabolizing system, using the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA102 and TA104. The present study indicates that extracts of P. crinita flowers are a significant source of compounds with antigenotoxic and antioxidant activity (most likely phenolic compounds) and thus may be useful candidates for chemoprevention studies.",Is extracts of P. crinita mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False

The IC(50) values of the inhibitory activity toward lipid peroxidation of total oligomer flavonoids (TOF), methanol, ethyl acetate, and aqueous extracts were respectively 28, 52, 472, and 480 microg/mL. All extracts have the ability to scavenge the ABTS(*+) radical by a hydrogen-donating mechanism and to protect pKS plasmid DNA against hydroxyl radicals- induced DNA damage. An assay for the ability of A. salicina extracts to prevent mutations induced by various mutagens in Salmonella typhimurium TA102 and TA104 cells was conducted. TOF, methanol, ethyl acetate, and aqueous extracts from leaf parts of A. salicina showed no mutagenicity either with or without the metabolic enzymes preparation (S9). Protection against methylmethanesulfonate-induced mutagenicity was observed for TOF, methanol, and ethyl acetate extracts. Likewise, all extracts exhibited a high inhibition level of the Ames response induced by the indirect mutagen, 2-aminoanthracene. The antigenotoxic activity could be ascribed, at least in part, to their antioxidant properties, but we cannot exclude additionally mechanisms. Thus, A. salicina may serve as an ideal candidate for a cost- effective, readily exploitable natural phytochemical compound.",Is Acacia salicina extracts mutagenic for TA102 strain?,False

None of the different extracts produced a mutagenic effect, except aqueous extract when incubated with Salmonella typhimurium TA100 after metabolic activation. Likewise, the antimutagenicity of the same extracts was tested using the ""Ames test"". Our results showed that M. arvensis extracts possess antimutagenic effects against sodium azide (SA) in the two tested Salmonella assay systems, except metabolized aqueous and PE extracts when tested with S. typhimurium TA100 assay system. Different extracts were also found to be effective in protecting plasmid DNA against the strand breakage induced by hydroxyl radicals, except PE and aqueous extracts. Antioxidant capacity of the tested extracts was evaluated using the enzymatic (xanthine/xanthine oxidase assay) (X/XOD) and the non enzymatic (NBT/Riboflavine assay) systems.

In this study, we employ the Ames test to assess the mutagenicity of compounds obtained from the leaves of these species. The methanol extract of the M. pusa was mutagenic to the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA97a and TA100, with or without metabolic activation. The methanol extract of M. elliptica induced mutagenic activity in TA98 when metabolized with S9 fraction and TA97a with and without S9, but with lower mutagenicity index (MI) and potencies values than those for M. pusa. Enriched fractions of flavonoids and tannins of M. pusa were also evaluated and they demonstrated positive mutagenicity. The highest values of MI and potency were obtained with the flavonoid fraction, which contains large amounts of quercetin, quercetin glycosides and myricetin.

Mutagenicity and antimutagenicity of the methanol extracts of unfermented and fermented steamed black soybeans against 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO), a direct mutagen and Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), an indirect mutagen, on Salmonella Typhimurium TA100 and TA 98, were examined. The methanol extracts of unfermented and fermented steamed black soybeans show no mutagenic activity for either test strains at the doses tested. The extracts inhibited mutagenesis by either 4-NQO or B[a]P in S. Typhimurium TA100 and TA98. Fermentation with fungi also enhanced the antimutagenic effect of black soybean while the antimutagenic effect of the fermented black soybeans extract varied with the starter organism, mutagen, and test strain of S. Typhimurium examined. Generally, the extracts of A. awamori-fermented black soybean exhibited the highest antimutagenic effect. With strain TA100, the inhibitory effects of 5.0 mg of A. awamori-fermented black soybean extract per plate on the mutagenic effects of 4-NQO and B[a]P were 92% and 89%, respectively, while the corresponding rates for extract of unfermented were 41% and 63%, respectively. With strain 98, the inhibition rates were 94 and 81% for the fermented bean extract and 58% and 44% for the unfermented bean extracts. Testing of extracts prepared from black soybean by A. awamori at temperatures 25, 30 and 35 degrees C and for times of 1-5 days revealed that, generally, the extract prepared from beans fermented at 30 degrees C for 3 days exhibited the greatest inhibition against the mutagenic effects of 4-NQO and B[a]P.",Is methanol extracts of unfermented and fermented steamed black soybeans mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False

In this study, the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of organic extracts of condensate, particulate matters (PM) and semivolatile organic compounds (SVOC) of gasoline and absolute methanol engine exhaust were examined by using MTT assay, micronucleus assay, comet assay and Ames test. The results have showed that gasoline engine exhaust exhibited stronger cytotoxicity to human lung carcinoma cell lines (A549 cell) than methanol engine exhaust. Furthermore, gasoline engine exhaust increased micronucleus formation, induced DNA damage in A549 cells and increased TA98 revertants in the presence of metabolic activating enzymes in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, methanol engine exhaust failed to exhibit these adverse effects. The results suggest methanol may be used as a cleaner fuel for automobile.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False

The methanol extract contains catechin, tannins, terpenes and flavonoids; both mutagenic potential and antioxidant properties have been ascribed to flavonoids. The mutagenicity of some flavonoids is believed to be associated with the formation of reactive oxygen species and seems to depend on the number and position of hydroxyl groups. In the present study the mutagenic activity of the methanol, chloroform and 80% aqueous methanol extracts, as well as acetate and aqueous sub-fractions, of this medicinal plant were evaluated by Salmonella typhimurium assay, using strains TA100, TA98, TA102 and TA97a, and in mouse reticulocytes. The results showed mutagenic activity of the methanolic extract in the TA98 strain without S9, but no mutagenicity to mouse cells in any of the extracts. The acetate fraction showed strong signs of mutagenicity without S9, suggesting that in this enriched fraction were concentrated the compounds that induced mutagenic activity. The aqueous fraction showed no mutagenic activity. The TLC and HSCCC analyses of the acetate fraction with some standard compounds permitted the isolation of the quercetin-3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside, quercetin-3-O-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside, amentoflavone, methyl gallate and (+)-catechin, of which only the amentoflavone exhibited positive mutagenicity to TA98 (+S9, -S9).",Is Byrsonima crassa mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True

1542,"Sulfonic acid esters are considered as potentially alkylating agents that may exert genotoxic effects in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. One possible source of human exposure stems from drug synthesis when the salt-forming agents methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid are used together with alcoholic solvents such as methanol, ethanol and propanol. In this study computer-assisted structural considerations and in vitro approaches (Ames mutagenicity test using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100, and the micronucleus test using L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells) were used to assess the genotoxic properties of 19 sulfonic esters. While all esters may be principally active as genotoxicants based on the presence of the sulfonate moiety, the statistical correlative multiple computer automated structure evaluation (MCASE) system (MC4PC version 1.0) using the Ames mutagenicity A2I module (version 1.54), rank-ordered the activity of the benzenesulfonic acid esters in the Ames test negligible due to an inactivating modulator and a deactivating fragment, whereas the methane- and toluenesulfonic acid esters were predicted to be positive in this test. In the Ames test, with the exception of the p-toluenesulfonic acid ethyl and iso-butyl esters, all compounds came out positive in Salmonella strain TA100. Methanesulfonic iso-propyl, sec-butyl and benzenesulfonic acid iso-propyl ester also showed mutagenic potential in strain TA98. In general, differences between results seen in Ames tests performed with or without metabolic activation were rather small. In L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, benzenesulfonic acid n- and iso-butyl ester and p-toluenesulfonic acid iso-butyl ester did not increase the number of cells containing micronuclei. The other esters were positive in this micronucleus test; however, methanesulfonic acid iso-butyl ester was found to be only weakly positive at excessively cytotoxic concentrations. These compounds were generally found to be more potent with regard to micronucleus induction when tested without metabolic activation (20 h treatment). In conclusion, the iso-propyl esters of the three sulfonic acids under study were found to be the strongest mutagens, either when tested in the Ames test or the micronucleus assay, whereas p-toluenesulfonic acid iso-butyl ester was the only compound shown to be devoid of a genotoxic potential in both tests.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1543,"The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of four extraction parameters (type of solvent, temperature, duration of extraction, and soil mass/solvent volume ratio) on the mutagenicity of soil extracts. Four urban soil samples were submitted to the micro-method adaptation of the Ames test on Salmonella typhimurium according to the following sequence: identification of the most sensitive strain (TA98 or TA100), the best solvent(s), the optimum extraction temperature and extraction time, and finally the optimal soil/solvent ratio. Extraction was thus performed using eight different solvents (distilled water, dichloromethane, acetonitrile, acetone, cyclohexane, methanol, hexane, or ethanol), two temperatures (room temperature or 37 degrees C), two durations (4 or 24 h), and two soil mass/solvent volume ratios (1:2 or 1:10). The results show that strain TA98 was more sensitive than strain TA100, and the observed mutagenicity was expressed as number of TA98 revertants per mg of soil equivalent. No mutagenicity was induced by the distilled water extracts, whereas most of the organic solvent extracts induced a significant mutagenic response. A dichloromethane/acetone mixture appeared to be the best compromise for extraction of mutagens from the urban soils tested. Moreover, the present study showed that a higher mutagenic activity was generally obtained with a temperature of 37 degrees C (compared to room temperature), with an extraction time of 24 h (compared to 4 h), and with a soil mass/solvent volume ratio of 1:10 (compared to 1:2).",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False

It is widely used in industry for the preparation of inks, resins, coatings, and was proposed for incorporation into dental composites. The objective of this study was to determine the mutagenic potential of this chemical related to its metabolite products. Several doses of Cyracure UVR 6105 were dissolved in DMSO and subjected to the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. A metabolic activation system (S9-mix) was used consisting of Arochlor-induced liver S9 homogenate enriched with NADP and glucose-6-phosphate cofactors. In contrast to studies without S9-mix, Cyracure UVR 6105 exhibited enhanced genotoxic activities with strains TA100 and TA1535 in the presence of liver S9-mix. From in vitro metabolism of Cyracure UVR 6105 with S9-mix, as used in the Ames assay, several metabolites were identified. The alcohol metabolite, 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethanol, containing intact epoxy group was identified in the organic solvent extract. This metabolite was synthesized and proved to be mutagenic against TA100 when assayed in the presence and absence of S9-mix. Results showed that the increased mutagenicity of Cyracure UVR-6105 in the presence of liver enzymes is due to the formation of the mutagenic metabolite 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethanol.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False

In this study genotoxic and anti-genotoxic activities of methanol extracts of Lactarius vellereus (Fr.: Fr.) Fr. were evaluated in the bacterial reverse mutation test with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and, in the mammalian cell test with human hepatoma (HepG2) cells, using the comet assay to measure DNA damage. The extract induced no mutations in S. typhimurium TA98 and no DNA damage in HepG2 cells. Against the indirect acting mutagen 2-amino-3-methylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoline (IQ) the extract showed significant, dose dependent antimutagenic activity, while it did not counteract the direct acting mutagen 4-nitroquinoline oxide (4-NQO). The extract also exerted a protective effect against IQ induced genotoxicity in mammalian cells of human origin. Treatment of HepG2 cells with the L. vellereus extract (125-500 microg/ml) together with IQ, reduced the genotoxic effect of the latter in a dose dependent manner. Our findings show that a methanol extract of L. vellereus is highly protective against IQ induced DNA damage in human derived cells and L. vellereus can be considered as a natural source of antimutagens with potential pharmacological applications in cancer prevention.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False

Thus, the antimutagenic effect of compounds 1-4 would be mainly based on the inhibition of the enzymatic activation of heterocyclic amines.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1548,"In the city of Aligarh (India), wastewater coming from both industrial and domestic sources and without any treatment is used to irrigate the agricultural crops. This practice has been polluting the soil, and the pollutants could possibly reach the food chain. For the above reason, soil irrigated with wastewater was sampled and monitored for the presence of genotoxic agents using three biological assays namely Ames Salmonella/mammalian microsome test, survival of SOS defective E. coli K-12 mutants and bacteriophage lambda systems. Extracts from soils were prepared using different organic solvents, i.e. methanol, acetonitrile and acetone. TA98 was found to be most sensitive strain to all the soil extracts. A significant decline in the survival of DNA repair defective E. coli K-12 mutants as compared to their isogenic wild-type counterparts were observed when treated with soil extracts. PolA was found to be the most sensitive strain. A remarkable decline in the plaque forming units was also observed when tested with the soil extracts. Extracts of soil that has been irrigated with ground water were also tested by the above three biological assays to compare the results.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1549,"A bacterial reverse-mutation assay with Salmonella Typhimurium TA1535, TA1537, TA98, TA100, and TA102 and an in vitro chromosome aberration assay with Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells were used to investigate the genotoxicity of the methanol extract of Korean soybean paste (doen-jang [dwen-jahng]) and its antigenotoxic activity against aflatoxin B1. The methanol extract revealed nonmutagenic potential for all of the bacterial strains tested. The extract significantly reduced the numbers of revertants per plate when it was added to the assay system with Salmonella Typhimurium TA100 (P < 0.05). The extract also exhibited significant inhibitory effects on chromosome aberration in CHL cells (P < 0.05). The findings of this work indicate that the methanol extract of Korean soybean paste could have strong potential as an antigenotoxic material.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
1550,"We determined the antimutagenic potential of chloroform, acetone, methanol, methanol+HCl, diethyl ether, and ethyl acetate extracts of Terminalia arjuna bark against the model mutagen 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO) using the Salmonella/microsome, comet, and micronucleus (MN) tests. Salmonella typhimurium TA100 strain and human peripheral white blood cells were coincubated with various concentrations (from 5 to 500 microg) of the six extracts and 4-NQO (from 0.05 to 2 microg). We found that the 4-NQO mutagenicity was inhibited by more than 70% in the Salmonella/microsome test at the highest nontoxic extract dose of ethyl acetate (50 microg/plate), chloroform (100 microg/plate), acetone, (100 microg/plate), and methanol (500 microg/plate). A less marked antimutagenicity activity (inhibition of about 40-45%) was observed for the acidic methanol and diethyl ether extracts. The comet assay showed that acetone extract (100 microg/mL) was more effective in reducing the DNA damage caused by 4-NQO (ca. 90%), whereas the chloroform, ethyl acetate, and diethyl ether extracts were cytotoxic. In the MN test, the decrease in 4-NQO clastogenicity was observed by testing the mutagen especially with chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts (inhibition about 40-45%). The acetone and methanol extracts showed a less marked activity (33% and 37%, respectively). The results of the present study suggest that T. arjuna bark contains some nonpolar as well as polar compounds with antimutagenic activity against 4-NQO. Several explanations can be suggested, but further investigations are necessary to definitely identify the active compounds.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
1551,"Water samples from the Waka River, which runs through an area housing many chemical industry facilities in Wakayama, Japan, have been found to show significant mutagenicity, especially without a mammalian metabolic activation system (S9 mix) in the Salmonella typhimurium YG1024 strain. Mutagens in the river water were adsorbed to 3 kg of blue cotton, extracted with methanol/ammonia, and separated by several low- and high-pressure liquid chromatography steps with reversed-phase columns. One mutagen (0.6 mg), accounting for 50% of the total mutagenicity of the adsorbed materials, was isolated. On the basis of the mass, high-resolution mass, (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR spectra, the chemical was determined to have a polychlorinated biphenyl skeleton with nitro and amino substitution groups. Well-designed chemical synthesis of the putative mutagen revealed it to be 4-amino-3,3'-dichloro-5,4'-dinitrobiphenyl. This novel compound exerted strong mutagenicity without the S9 mix, inducing 66,000 and 140,000 revertants/nmol in S. typhimurium TA98 and YG1024, respectively. Moreover, this polychlorinated biphenyl derivative was proven to activate the human aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated transcription in a lac Z reporter gene assay with an efficiency almost the same as that of beta-naphthoflavone, well-known to be a synthetic aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist. It is possible that the mutagen is formed unintentionally via postemission modification of drainage water containing parent chemicals, such as 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine or 3,3'-dichloro-4,4'-dinitrobiphenyl, which are known to be raw materials in the manufacture of polymers and dye intermediates in chemical plants.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1552,"Since the fume of cooking oil has been reported to increase the risk of lung cancer, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the mutagenicity and to find the mutagens in the fumes of peanut oil heated to the smoke point. Peanut oil prepared from roasted peanut kernel showed a lower smoke point, less unsaturated fatty acids, more fume formation, and stronger mutagenicity than that from unroasted kernel. Further investigation of mutagenic compounds was performed by the Ames test and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. Among the 12 compounds identified from the neutral fraction of methanol extract, four compounds at a dose of 10 microg per plate were mutagenic to Salmonella Typhimurium TA98 and TA100 in the order of trans-trans-2,4-decadienal > trans-trans-2,4-nonadienal > trans-2-decenal > trans-2-undecenal.

1553,"A methanol extract from Pueraria lobata showed a suppressive effect on umu gene expression of the SOS response in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 against the mutagen 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (furylfuramide). The methanol extract from P. lobata was re-extracted with hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, butanol, and water, respectively. A suppressive compound in the dichloromethane and ethyl acetate extract fractions was isolated by SiO(2) column chromatography and identified as tectorigenin (1) by EI-MS and (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy. Compound 1 and its methylated derivative [7,4'-di-O-methyltectorigenin (2)] had the suppressive effects on umu gene expression of the SOS response in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002 against furylfuramide, 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide, N-methyl-N'-nitrosoguanidine, and activated Trp-P-1, which do not require live metabolic activation by S9. These compounds also showed suppression of SOS-inducing activity against Trp-P-1 and AfB(1), which requires liver metabolizing enzymes. In addition to the antimutagenic activities of these compounds against furylfuramide, Trp-P-1 and activated Trp-P-1 were also assayed by an Ames test using S. typhimurium TA100.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 strain?,False
1554,"Antimutagens from gaiyou (Artemisia argyi Levl. et Vant., Compositae) were examined. The methanol extract prepared from aerial parts of this plant strongly reduced the mutagenicity of 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), when Salmonella typhimurium TA98 was used in the presence of the rat liver microsomal fraction. The antimutagens were purified chromatographically while monitoring the antimutagenic activity against Trp-P-2 with a modified Ames test employing a plate method. This purification resulted in the isolation of four strong antimutagens, 5,7-dihydroxy-6,3',4'-trimethoxyflavone (eupatilin), 5, 7,4'-trihydroxy-6,3'-dimethoxyflavone (jaceosidin), 5,7, 4'-trihydroxyflavone (apigenin) and 5,7, 4'-trihydroxy-3'-methoxyflavone (chrysoeriol) from the methanol extract. These antimutagenic flavones exhibited strong antimutagenic activity against not only Trp-P-2 but also against other heterocyclic amines, such as 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4, 3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3, 8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-3-methyl-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (MeA(alpha)C) in S. typhimurium TA98. In contrast, they did not exhibit antimutagenic activity against benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO), 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 2-nitrofluorene (2-NF) or furylfuramide (AF-2) in S. typhimurium TA98, or B[a]P, 4-NQO, 2-NF, AF-2, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) or sodium azide (SA) in Salmonella typhimurium TA100, whereas they decreased the mutagenicity caused by aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) and 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA) in both of these tester strains. Regarding the structure-activity relationship, the tested flavones had distinct differences in the intensities of their antimutagenic activities according to the differences of their substitution patterns. Namely, the intensity of antimutagenic activities against Trp-P-2 decreased in the order of: 5,7,3',4'-tetrasubstituted flavones (IC(50): <0.1 mmol/plate), 5,7,4'-trisubstituted flavones (IC(50): 0.120-0.260 mmol/plate), 5,6,7,3',4'-pentasubstituted flavones (IC(50): 0.440-0. 772 mmol/plate). The four isolated flavones were also studied regarding their antimutagenic mechanisms with preincubation methods of the modified Ames test and emission spectroscopic analysis. The results suggested that all isolated flavones were desmutagens which directly inactivated Trp-P-2 or inhibited its metabolic activation.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False

The methanol extract was re-extracted with hexane, dichloromethane, butanol, and water. A dichloromethane fraction showed a suppressive effect. Suppressive compounds against furylfuramide in the dichloromethane fraction were isolated by SiO(2) column chromatography and identified as 7,4'-di-O-methyleriodictyol (1), 7, 3',4'-tri-O-methyleriodictyol (2), and 3,7,4'-tri-O-methylkaempferol (3). In addition, three flavonoids, ombuine (4), pachypodol (5), and kumatakenin (6), were isolated and identified from the dichrolomethane fraction. Compounds 1 and 3 suppressed >50% of the SOS-inducing activity at <0.6 micromol/mL, and the ID(50) values of both compounds were 0.25 micromol/mL. Compound 2 showed a weakly suppressive effect (17%) at a concentration of 0.6 micromol/mL, and compounds 4-6 did not. These compounds were also assayed with 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), which requires liver metabolizing enzymes. Compounds 3-6 suppressed >80% of the SOS-inducing activity of Trp-P-1 at <0.06 micromol/mL, and compounds 1 and 2 suppressed 87 and 63% at a concentration of 0.3 micromol/mL. In addition, these compounds were assayed with activated Trp-P-1, and the suppressed effects of these compounds were further decreased when compared to Trp-P-1.

The methanol extract from C. aurantium was successively re-extracted with hexane, dichloromethane, butanol, and water. A dichloromethane fraction showed a suppressive effect. The suppressive compounds in the dichloromethane fraction were isolated by SiO(2) column chromatography and identified as tetra-O-methylscutellarein (1), sinensetin (2), and nobiletin (3) by EI-MS and (1)H- and (13)C NMR spectroscopy. These compounds suppressed the furylfuramide-induced SOS response in the umu test. Gene expression was suppressed 67%, 45%, and 25% at a concentration of 0.6 micromol/mL, respectively. The ID(50) value (50% inhibition dose) of compound 1 was 0. 19 micromol/mL. These compounds were assayed with other mutagens, 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), which requires liver metabolizing enzymes, activated Trp-P-1, and UV irradiation.

1557,"Fifteen kinds of commonly consumed Thai vegetables were sequentially extracted with hexane, chloroform and methanol, and then tested for antimutagenic activities against direct-acting (AF-2 and NaN3) and indirect-acting (AFB1 and B(a)P) mutagens using Ames' Salmonella mutagenicity test with Salmonella typhimurium TA100 as tester strain. It was found that only the methanol extract of neem leaves contain weak antimutagen inhibiting the mutagenicities of both direct-acting mutagens. Interestingly, all vegetables studied were found to contain chemical compounds, mainly nonpolar ones, capable of inhibiting the mutagenicity of AFB1, while only some vegetables contain chemical compounds capable of inhibiting the mutagenicity of B(a)P, which is also an indirect-acting mutagen. Studies on anticarcinogenic potentials demonstrated that Thai bitter gourd fruits, but not sweet basil leaves, at the concentration of 6.25% and 12.5% in the diet, partially inhibited DMBA-induced mammary gland carcinogenesis in female Sprague-Dawley rats when fed to the animals 2 weeks prior to DMBA. Results in the present study therefore demonstrated that most Thai vegetables contain antimutagens inhibiting the mutagenicity of some indirect-acting mutagen, particularly AFB1. The mechanism of their antimutagenicity may probably be the inhibition of the activity of metabolic-activating enzymes in rat liver homogenates. Very interestingly, our results clearly reveal that Thai bitter gourd fruits, which possess Phase II enzymes inducing property, as well as the ability to reduce Phase I enzyme activities in rat liver, contain some anticarcinogens or chemopreventive agents. However, sweet basil leaves that possess both Phase I and Phase II enzyme-inducing properties may not contain any anticarcinogen, at least against DMBA-induced mammary gland carcinogenesis.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False

The suppressive effect of YE was also observed for 2-aminoanthracene and activated Trp-P-1, without a significant effect on bacterial growth. The extract exhibited a weak suppressive effect on SOS-induction by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, but not by furylfuramide or 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide. The antimutagenic activity of YE against Trp-P-1 was demonstrated by Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA98. Isolation and purification of the active component of YE was carried out using SiO2 column chromatography, and 275 mg of antimutagenic compound was isolated from 2.5 kg of dried chips of yucca roots and branches. The compound was identified as 3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene (THS).

1559,"Using the Salmonella/microsome assay, the antimutagenic effects of specific components of the extracts from eggplant fruits were investigated. The eggplant fruit juice exhibited an antimutagenic activity against 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) induced mutagenicity. In some of the fractions extracted with several organic solvents (acetone, petroleum ether, ethyl acetate; and methanol), the activity was recognized. No mutagenicity or toxicity for Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of S9 mixture was observed with any of the extracts. It is suggested that there are multiple components of the activities that exist in the eggplant fruit. We isolated lutein from the 84% methanol (methanol/water, v/v) layer, pheophorbide or chlorophyllide from the 70% methanol layer and tannins containing sugar-moieties from the water layer. Pheophytin a and b, Mg-free derivatives of chlorophyll a and b, were isolated from the petroleum ether layer as possible antimutagens.

1561,The genotoxicity of environmental complex mixtures was tested with Ames mutagenicity assay and with Bacillus subtilis rec assay for estimation of primary DNA damage. Soil samples obtained from an area contaminated with petrochemical wastes were sequentially extracted with ethyl ether and methanol. After evaporation to dryness the extracts were resuspended in dimethylsulfoxide for their use in biological tests. No mutagenic response was detected with the Ames test. Ether extract from parcel 1 showed an unusually high toxicity for Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and induced DNA damage in Bacillus subtilis with a clear relationship dose-genotoxic response. The analysis of the results obtained in both assays and the nature of the samples indicate that the genotoxicity detected in the complex mixture is compatible with the one caused by DNA intercalating compounds.,Is methanol mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
1562,"Organic materials were extracted from particulates exhausted from a small diesel engine (displacement 269 ml) by the ultrasonic extraction method with three different solvent systems, methanol, dichloromethane and a 4:1 (v:v) mixture of benzene and ethanol. These solvent-extracted materials were tested for mutagenic activity by the Ames Salmonella/microsome assay system using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA98NR and TA98/1,8-DNP6. The concentrations of 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) and 1,6-dinitropyrene (1,6-diNP) in these extracted materials were also measured after nitroreduction by high pressure liquid chromatography. The methanol-extracted and benzene-ethanol-extracted materials showed the lowest and the highest mutagenic activity, respectively. The methanol-extracted, dichloromethane-extracted and benzene-ethanol-extracted materials induced 260, 1,570 and 3,240 His+ revertants per plate per mg of extracted materials, respectively, from strain TA98 in the absence of S9 mix. These materials showed decreased mutagenicity for strains TA98NR and TA98/1,8-DNP6, indicating that the particulates in the diesel engine exhaust contained 1-NP and diNPs. Actually, the amount of 1-NP and 1,6-diNP in the methanol-extracted, dichloromethane-extracted and benzene-ethanol-extracted materials were 17.0 and 0.03 ng, 37.5 and 0.97 ng, and 71.3 and 1.03 ng per mg of extracted materials, respectively, accounting for 11.9 and 3.2%, 4.4 and 17.3%, and 4.0 and 8.9%, respectively, of the total mutagenicity of the extracted materials. From these results it is concluded that a mixture of benzene-ethanol (4:1, v/v) is the most suitable solvent for extraction of organic matter containing nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as NPs from particulates in diesel engine exhaust.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1563,"During the photolysis of tryptophan a large number of products is formed. In this study, aqueous solutions of tryptophan were irradiated by ultraviolet light during 5, 20 or 40 h. Each of the irradiated batches was divided into two aliquots, which were freeze-dried or extracted with chloroform. For each batch the latter extract was subsequently divided into a purified chloroform extract and a methanol extract. Aliquots of the purified chloroform extracts were fractionated and pooled, peakwise, into seven fractions. A recombined sample was also constructed. All extracts and samples were tested for mutagenicity using the standard Ames Salmonella assay. The results indicate an exposure time dependent increase in mutagenicity of the extracts, as seen with tester strain TA100 both with and without metabolic activation. The mutagenicity of the freeze-dried extracts well approximated the mutagenicity of the chloroform extracts, indicating that most mutagenicity can be extracted with chloroform. With the fractions the highest mutagenic responses were seen in the late, i.e., less lipophilic fractions. This response pattern seen in TA98 and TA100, mainly with S9 activation, was in contrast to the response of TA102 without S9, which was highest to the more lipophilic fractions. On a fraction level, no general exposure dependent increase of mutagenicity was observed. The results also show that photooxidation of tryptophan gives rise to a different spectrum of products compared to pyrolysis. Both processes result in compounds with strong biological effects. Photooxidation results in compounds with low genotoxicity and high Ah receptor affinity while pyrolysis generates compounds with high genotoxicity and low or no Ah receptor affinity.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
1564,"Three kinds of spices (caraway, coriander and black pepper seeds) and a medicinal plant called 'tong tak' in Thai (Baliospermum axillar, a species of the spurge family) were fractionated into hot water, methanol and hexane extracts. These extracts were not mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 by the Ames assay. However, when the extracts were treated with nitrite, samples of the water and methanol extracts were mutagenic for strain TA100 without metabolic activation. The mutagenicity of the nitrite-treated methanol and hot water extracts of black pepper was highest (8380 and 22,200 His+ per 0.1 g of spice powder, respectively), and that of the nitrite-treated hot water extracts of caraway and tong tak was moderate. The hot water extracts were examined for their antimutagenic activity against mutagenicity induced by various carcinogens by the Ames assay, using the preincubation technique. The tested samples (equivalent to 1-2 mg of spice powder) reduced the mutagenicity induced by 2.7 nmole (397 ng) of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine by more than 84%, and that induced by dimethylnitrosamine (1.48 mg) or ICR-170 (10 ng) by 30-60%. However, they did not inhibit the mutagenic activity of 1-nitropyrene, 3-nitrofluoranthene, AF-2, methyl methanesulfonate, N-ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, 2-aminoanthracene, 2-acetylaminofluorene, benzo[a]pyrene or IQ.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1565,"The edible part of fresh Chinese radish was chopped into small pieces, lyophilized, and then extracted sequentially with hexane, chloroform, and methanol. The solvent in each fraction was removed by evaporation under reduced pressure at 50-55 degrees C, and the residue was dissolved in dimethylsufoxide just before being tested for antimutagenicity as well as mutagenicity using the Salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity test. We found that none of the three fractions exhibited any mutagenicity toward S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 when tested either in the presence or absence of S-9 mix. Interestingly, however, hexane and chloroform extracts could strongly inhibit the mutagenicities of both direct mutagens (e.g., 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide and sodium azide) and indirect mutagens (e.g., aflatoxin B1). In contrast, however, these two fractions did not inhibit the mutagenicity of benzo[a]pyrene, which is also an indirect mutagen. Both hexane and chloroform extracts could also markedly inhibit the activities of rat liver aniline hydroxylase and aminopyrine demethylase. The methanol fraction could inhibit neither the mutagenicities of direct or indirect mutagens tested nor the activities of those two rat liver enzymes. Results of the present study demonstrate that Chinese radish may not contain any mutagenic compound but does contain some nonpolar compounds with antimutagenic activity toward both direct and indirect mutagens. In addition, the antimutagenic activity toward aflatoxin B1 may be partly due to the inhibition of enzymes necessary for activation of this mutagen.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False

Urban airborne particulate was collected with high-volume samplers in an Italian town mainly polluted by traffic exhaust fumes. After being weighted for determination of total dust, the particulate was extracted with CH2Cl2/methanol and assayed by Salmonella/microsome assay on strains TA98, TA100 and TA98NR. All samples were mutagenic on strain TA98, with a mutagenic potency of 50 +/- 14 (-S9), 128 +/- 63 (+S9) and 104 +/- 51 (-S9), 211 +/- 97 (+S9) revertants/mg of particulate for summer (n = 23) and winter (n = 22) determinations, respectively. The mutagenic activity on strain TA98NR was about one-half that on strain TA98, indicating a large contribution of nitroaromatic mutagenic compounds. Mutagens from airborne particulate were less active on strain TA100. The summer and winter mean values of urban total dust were 0.15 +/- 0.07 and 0.35 +/- 0.18 mg/m3 respectively, and the mutagenicity of urban air on strain TA98 was 8 +/- 5 (-S9), 22 +/- 17 (+S9) and 30 +/- 11 (-S9), 61 +/- 21 (+S9) revertants/m3 in the two seasons, respectively. In winter, besides an increase in urban air mutagenicity, there also was a change in direct particulate activity per milligram, which was double that of summer.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1567,"Combined bottom and fly ash obtained from a Chicago, IL, municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) was extracted with organic solvents, water or acidified water. The mean amounts of organic material isolated from each extraction procedure were 688.2, 91.8 and 167.7 micrograms/g MSWI ash. These extracts were evaluated for toxicity and mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. We developed and calibrated a micropreincubation assay to evaluate small concentrations of the organic extracts. No direct-acting mutagens were found, however the acid-treated aqueous extracts were toxic. Materials isolated with methylene chloride methanol were mutagenic after hepatic microsomal activation (S9). The mutagenic potencies of the organic extract normalized to a per gram ash basis was the induction of 103.46 revertants in TA98 and 247.5 revertants in TA100. The aqueous extracts were neither toxic nor mutagenic. However, the acid-treated aqueous extract was mutagenic to TA100. The organic material isolated from the acidic extract had an induced mutagenic potency of 44.2 revertants/mg extract. Normalizing these data indicate a mutagenic potency of 7.4 revertants/g MSWI ash leached.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1568,"To obtain insight into the identity of chemicals associated with the mutagenicity of United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Materials SRM 1649 (urban dust) and SRM 1650 (diesel particulate), parallel mutagenicity tests and chemical analyses were performed on dichloromethane and sequential organic extracts of these samples. SRM 1649 and 1650 were sequentially extracted with five organic solvents of increasing polarity, in order to partition mutagenic components into discrete fractions. The solvents (with associated polarity index) were as follows: (1) hexane (0.0); (2) hexane:diethyl ether 9:1 (0.29); (3) hexane:diethyl ether 1:1 (1.45); (4) diethyl ether (2.9); (5) methanol (6.6). 0.9270 g of SRM 1649, and 0.0510 g of SRM 1650 were each extracted three times with 8 ml of each of the solvents, the three aliquots were pooled, and analysed for target organics or solvent-exchanged into DMSO for mutagenicity testing in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. The dichloromethane extracts of SRM 1649 and SRM 1650 contained direct-acting mutagens in Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100; SRM 1650 was significantly more potent than SRM 1649 in either strain. Addition of S9 caused a large decrease in mutagenicity of each extract, although SRM 1650 remained more potent. An interesting pattern of mutagenicity was observed for the sequential extracts of SRM 1649 and SRM 1650: the mutagenic potency of SRM 1649 extracts increased with increasing polarity of the extraction solvent while the response of the SRM 1650 extracts was the opposite. This suggests that the direct-acting mutagens in SRM 1650 are unlike those in SRM 1649. The response, though diminished, was largely unchanged when S9 was included in the test mixture. Chemical analyses on the various extracts were performed using a Hewlett-Packard model 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a model 5970B mass selective detector (GC-MSD), and a 0.3 microns film thickness cross-linked methyl silicone capillary column (HP 1909A-101). Selected ion monitoring (SIM) methods were used to analyze for 105 target compounds including PAHs and nitro-PAHs. Chemical analysis of the dichloromethane extracts of SRM 1649 and SRM 1650 identified three main classes of compounds: polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), nitro-polyaromatic hydrocarbons (NO2-PAHs) and heterocyclics. The concentration of target compounds and the proportion of nitro-PAHs and heterocyclic compounds were considerably greater in SRM 1650 than in SRM 1649, consistent with the observed differences in their mutagenic potency. However, the different responses of the dichloromethane extracts in TA98 and TA100 suggest the presence of different (unidentified) compounds.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1569,"A methanol extract of air-borne particulates collected in a suburban area of Okayama City showed not only mutagenicity but also antimutagenicity in the Ames test. Thus, when the mutagenicity of this preparation in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 (with metabolic activation) was measured, we observed that the dose response reached a plateau at 27 m3 air equivalent of the particulate, showing approximately equal numbers of revertants in the dose range 27-270 m3 equivalent. This plateau formation was not seen in the dose response of a blue-cotton extract of this preparation: the extract gave a linearly increasing dose response up to 270 m3 equivalent. This finding suggests that some factors that inhibit the mutagenicity were present in this methanol extract and that these inhibitors were not adsorbable to blue cotton, an adsorbent selective for compounds having 3 or more fused rings. From the portion unadsorbed to blue cotton, we isolated the antimutagenic factors and identified them as long-chain fatty acids: palmitic, stearic, oleic and linoleic acids. Analysis of several samples, including those from other parts of Japan, has suggested that these antimutagenic fatty acids are ubiquitous in air-borne particulates.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1570,"Methanol is a widely used solvent for organic compounds and a human toxicant. In our studies of the metabolism of aromatic amines in the Ames/Salmonella assay, we observed a rapid and quantitative conversion of the mutagenic and carcinogenic aromatic amine 2,4-diaminotoluene (2,4-DAT) to a single product. This product was only produced in the presence of methanol, and not other organic solvents. Isolation of this product showed that it was highly mutagenic in Salmonella TA98 with S9 activation. Characterization of the product of the interaction of methanol and 2,4-DAT indicated that methanol is activated to a reactive intermediate, probably formaldehyde, by the 9000 X g supernatant used in the Ames/Salmonella assay. The formaldehyde subsequently reacts with 2,4-DAT to form the mutagenic product, identified as bis-5,5'(2,4,2',4'-tetraaminotolyl)methane. Results of this study demonstrate that methanol may be an inappropriate solvent for mutation and metabolism studies of aromatic amines and possibly other chemicals, and that solvent-xenobiotic interactions may in some cases lead to the misinterpretation of results.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1571,"Four commercial oxidative-type hair dye formulations, A, B, C, and D, were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to simulate normal conditions of use, and the oxidized hair dyes were tested for their mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of a mammalian metabolic activation system (S9 mix). Most of them did not show obvious mutagenicity in the range of 1-25 microliters/plate and all exhibited bactericidal activity at 10 microliters/plate. In order to evaluate the mutagenicity of hair dyes both before and after H2O2 oxidation, rayon linked to a copper-phthalocyanine derivative (blue rayon) was used as an adsorbent for the elimination of interfering bactericidal compounds. Adsorbed compounds on blue rayon were eluted with ammoniacal methanol and eluents were subjected to the Ames test. The mutagenicity of the blue-rayon extracts in TA98 with S9 mix was increased by H2O2 oxidation. The blue-rayon extracts obtained from oxidized A and B were potent mutagens and reverted 334 and 999 colonies/10 microliters of original substance, respectively. In addition, 88 and 249 ng of 2,7-diaminophenazine, which was extremely mutagenic in TA98 with S9 mix, were detected in the extracts of 40 ml of the hair dye formulations A and B, respectively. The mutagenicity in oxidized hair dye formulations was successfully detected by use of blue-rayon extraction. 2,7-Diaminophenazine was only formed in the hair dye formulations containing m-phenylenediamine by H2O2 oxidation. Therefore, attention needs to be paid to the use of m-phenylenediamine as a hair dye component, not only for its own toxicity but also for that of its oxidation products.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1572,"The mutagenic potential of two soils amended with a municipal sewage sludge at two application rates was monitored over a 2-year period using Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay. Samples were collected from undisturbed monolith lysimeters of Weswood sandy clay (Fluventic Ustochrept) and Padina sandy loam (Grossarenic Paleustalf) amended with dried sewage sludge at 50 and 100 Mg/ha. Soil samples were collected and sequentially extracted with methylene chloride and methanol. The residues from these extracts were tested for mutagenicity at five doses with and without metabolic activation in Salmonella strain TA98. In general, the mutagenic potential of the amended soils of both application rates for the first 8 weeks following sludge application increased and then slowly decreased. The maximum mutagenic response observed in the soil extracts was 222 revertants at a dose of 10 mg of residue. This response was induced by the methanol extract from the Weswood soil collected 56 days after the application of 50 Mg/ha sewage sludge as compared to the 100 Mg/ha application which induced 202 revertants/mg. The mutagenicity of all fractions extracted from the sludge-amended soil at both application rates collected 717 days after application were not appreciably different from extracts from the unamended soils. The data indicate that chemicals that were mutagenic in bacteria persist in the soil and that at the higher application rates, as much as 2 years may be required for the mutagenic potential of the soil to return to background levels.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1573,"A life-time mouse-skin carcinogenicity assay was conducted using female NMRI mice to evaluate the possible direct carcinogenic activity of a mutagenic fraction isolated from beech wood dusts. The samples of untreated beech wood dusts were extracted with methanol at pH3 and were purified from the inhibitory compounds toxic to bacteria, using silica-gel column chromatography. The fraction obtained after passing through the column was tested for mutagenicity in the Ames assay employing Salmonella typhimurium TA100 in the presence of Aroclor-treated rat-liver-S9. Using acetone as the vehicle, this mutagenic fraction was tested for carcinogenicity on an area of 1-1.5 cm shaved skin of mice on the lower back. The mice were treated with half of each dose, twice a week, for only 3 months. The total doses applied per week were 2.5, 5, 7.5 or 10 g equivalent dust/mouse. No substance was used as promoter. No statistically significant difference was found when the life spans of treated and untreated animals were compared. The observed carcinogenic effect was based on tumours and lesions found only on the site of application of the test material. Of 210 mice (effective number, 129) serving as the negative controls, three developed skin lesions but no tumours. Of 280 treated animals (effective number, 188) 34 developed different types of tumours and 20 had a uniform type of precancerous skin lesion. Of 34 tumours observed 21 were originated from the skin, 12 from the mammary glands beneath the site of application, and one was a lymphoma. Comparing the negative controls with the treated animals, the overall carcinogenic effect observed was dose-dependent and statistically significant. Excluding the mammary tumours and a lymphoma found beneath the site of treatment, the overall induction of skin tumours was still significant. However, the dose-dependent increase in the number of skin tumours alone was not statistically significant. These results suggest that beech wood dust contains mutagenic and carcinogenic constituent(s).",Is methanol mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
1574,"The mutagenic activity of methanol extracts from airconditioner filters was tested using the standard plate-incorporation procedure for the Ames test and the strains Salmonella typhimurium TA97, TA98 and TA100 as test organisms. In a first set of experiments filters from 4 buildings were investigated. For each building the mutagenic activity of a filter which was in use during the fire (fire-exposed) was compared with the mutagenic activity of a filter which was exposed for a similar time span to normal urban air (non-exposed). While for 1 pair of filters the non-exposed extract was more mutagenic than the fire-exposed material, the opposite was found for 2 other filter pairs, and in 1 case there was hardly any difference in the mutagenic activities of the fire-exposed and the non-exposed filter extracts. Overall differences by factors up to 100 were observed in the mutants/m3 air values of the most and the least mutagenic filter extracts. The second group of experiments was performed to investigate the variations in mutagenic activity of filter extracts occurring due to changes in the weather conditions. Airborne particles were collected for 3 consecutive periods of 10-11 days at the 2 buildings where the extracts of the fire-exposed filters had been found to be more mutagenic than the corresponding control materials. The differences between the strongest and the weakest mutagenic filter extracts of these series were similar to the differences observed previously between the fire-exposed filters and the non-exposed filter materials. The highest mutagenic activities found in the second group of experiments was similar, at both sites, to the mutagenic activities measured in the fire-exposed extracts from these 2 buildings. Since the differences in the mutagenic activities of filters exposed to urban air during the different meteorological conditions were similar to the differences observed between fire-exposed and non-exposed materials, it is not possible to state whether the fire led to the distribution of mutagenic chemicals, although it is theoretically possible. However, based on the observation that the maximal mutagenic activities of the fire-exposed and the non-exposed extracts were similar, the present study allows the conclusion that the mutagenic burden for the population of the area of Basel was not significantly increased by the fire in Schweizerhalle on November 1, 1986.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1575,"15 hazardous industrial waste samples were evaluated for mutagenicity in the Salmonella plate-incorporation assay using strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence and absence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver S9. Dichloromethane/methanol extracts of the crude wastes were also evaluated. 7 of the crude wastes were mutagenic, but only 2 of the extracts of these 7 wastes were mutagenic; extracts of 2 additional wastes also were mutagenic. In addition, 10 of the crude wastes were administered by gavage to F-344 rats, and 24-h urine samples were collected. Of the 10 raw urines evaluated, 3 were mutagenic in strain TA98 in the presence of S9 and beta-glucuronidase. The 3 crude wastes that produced these 3 mutagenic urines were, themselves, mutagenic. Adequate volumes of 6 of the 10 raw urines were available for extraction/concentration. These 6 urines were incubated with beta-glucuronidase and eluted through Sep-Pak C18 columns; the methanol eluates of 3 of the urines were mutagenic, and these were the same 3 whose raw urines also were mutagenic. In general, the C18/methanol extraction procedure reduced the cytotoxicity and increased the mutagenic potency of the urines. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the mutagenicity of urine from rodents exposed to hazardous wastes. Based on the present results, the use of only strain TA98 in the presence of S9 might be adequate for general screening of hazardous wastes or waste extracts for genotoxicity. The urinary mutagenesis assay does not appear to be a useful adjunct to the Salmonella assay for screening hazardous wastes. The problems associated with chemically fractionating diverse types of hazardous wastes for bioassay are also discussed.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1576,"The mutagenic activity of sidestream cigarette smoke particles was estimated by testing sidestream cigarette smoke particles which had been collected under controlled burning conditions in the laboratory. Two different extraction methods (Soxhlet and ultrasonic agitation) and 3 different solvents (dichloromethane, methanol, and acetone) were compared for their efficiencies in the extraction of compounds from sidestream cigarette smoke particles which are mutagenic in the Ames test. The mutagenic activity of the sidestream smoke particles was estimated to be 15,000-20,000 revertants per cigarette in TA98 with metabolic activation and 12,000-17,000 revertants per cigarette in TA100 without metabolic activation. Only weak mutagenic activity was detected in TA98 without activation and in TA100 with activation. Under test conditions used, ultrasonic agitation produced the most consistent results and acetone extraction produced the highest levels of mutagenic activity.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1577,"The urine of mice injected intraperitoneally with pyrene during exposure to NO2 was found to contain highly mutagenic compounds by means of the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98. The mice were exposed to 20 ppm NO2 for 3 days before intraperitoneal injection of pyrene (800 mg/kg of body weight). The pyrene-treated mice were further exposed to NO2 for an additional 24 hr, and the urine from the mice was collected in ice-cooled containers and stored frozen in the dark. The collected samples were treated with beta-glucuronidase and passed through activated Sep-Pack C18 cartridges. After elution with methanol, the effluent was concentrated and the residue was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The DMSO solution was fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography and the mutagenicity of each fraction was assayed with S. typhimurium strain TA98. The mutagenic compounds 3-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, 6-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, 8-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene, and 1-hydroxypyrene were identified in the mutagenic fractions by mass spectrometry and UV-visible spectrophotometry with synthetic reference substances. These mutagenic compounds may have been formed by either nitration of hydroxylated pyrene, or hydroxylation of 1-nitropyrene, which is formed in vivo from pyrene and NO2, or the simultaneous occurrence of these two reactions in the mouse body.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1578,"The genetic activity of several medical grades of the anthelmintic drug pyrvinium pamoate, which is a dipyrvinium salt, was studied in a diploid mitotic recombination and gene conversion assay (strain D5 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and in several haploid yeast reversion assays (strains XV185-14C, XY718-1A, and 7854-1A). All of the samples were recombinogenic in strain D5 and mutagenic in the haploid strains, however, the degree of genetic activity varied considerably among the medical grades of pyrvinium pamoate that were tested. Similarly, these samples varied in degree of mutagenicity when they were tested in strains TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA102 of Salmonella typhimurium, but some of the medical grades of pyrvinium pamoate were mutagenic both in the presence and in the absence of the metabolic transformation system, whereas other medical grades of the drug required such activation to be mutagenic. In addition, the medical grades and dosage forms of several brands of pyrvinium pamoate were examined for purity by fluorescence high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a methanol:water (90:10) solvent system. The HPLC data indicate that monopyrvinium salts are the major contaminants in these pharmaceuticals. In general, there is a correlation between the degree of genetic activity and toxicity, and the number and relative quantity of impurities found in each sample.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
1579,"Phenylephrine hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic amine recommended for use as a nasal decongestant and as a mydriatic in ophthalmic applications. In 1977, total U.S. human exposure was estimated at 1.9 x 107 g per year. Phenylephrine hydrochloride was nominated for toxicology and carcinogenesis studies because of a lack of previous long-term studies and because two other sympathomimetic agents (soterenol hydrochloride and mesuprine hydrochloride) produced mesovarial leiomyomas in Sprague-Dawley rats. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of USP-grade phenylephrine hydrochloride were conducted by administering diets containing the chemical (99% pure) to F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex in studies of 14 days, 12 weeks, and 2 years. In the 14-day studies, no toxic effects were seen in rats or mice fed diets containing up to 2,000 ppm phenylephrine hydrochloride. Doses were increased in the 12-week studies, and deaths of male rats and male mice were observed in groups fed diets containing 10,000 or 20,000 ppm; 1/10 male rats in the 5,000-ppm group died. Other than inflammatory eye lesions (considered secondary to the pharmacologic drying action of the chemical), no specific organ toxicity was noted. Body weights decreased as concentrations of phenylephrine hydrochloride in the diet were increased, and feed consumption was lower in dosed rats. Doses of 0, 620, and 1,250 ppm for rats and 0, 1,250, and 2,500 ppm for mice were selected for the 2-year studies because of the decreased body weight gains in animals given higher doses in the 12-week studies. In the 2-year studies, the approximate amount of phenylephrine hydrochloride consumed per day was 24 mg/kg for low dose rats, 50 mg/kg for high dose rats, 133 mg/kg for low dose mice, and 270 mg/kg for high dose mice. Body weight differences in rats appeared to be dose related, and dosed animals were 3%-15% lighter than controls. Body weights of dosed mice averaged 3%-14% lower than those of controls throughout the 2-year studies. Survival of high dose male rats was greater than that of the controls (control, 30/50; low dose, 33/50; high dose, 42/50); differences in survival were not significant for female rats (42/50; 34/50; 36/50), male mice (35/50; 38/50; 43/50), or female mice (37/50; 34/50; 34/50). Few nonneoplastic lesions were related to phenylephrine hydrochloride dosing in rats or mice. Chronic focal inflammation of the liver was observed at increased incidences in dosed rats (male: 2/50; 13/50; 17/50; female:17/50; 28/50; 35/50). Inflammation of the prostate was seen more frequently in dosed than in control males (10/50; 24/50; 24/50). The incidence of focal cellular change in the liver was increased slightly in high dose male mice (0/50; 2/50; 7/50). In male rats, mononuclear cell leukemia (24/50; 9/50; 5/50) and pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland (14/49; 11/50; 2/50) occurred with negative trends, and the incidences in the high dose group were lower than those in the controls. No increases in neoplasia were seen in dosed male or female rats or mice. Phenylephrine hydrochloride was not mutagenic in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA98) with or without Aroclor 1254-induced liver S9 from male Sprague-Dawley rats or male Syrian hamsters. The results of mutagenicity studies of phenylephrine hydrochloride were equivocal in the mouse lymphoma L5178Y/TK+/- assay in the absence of S9; it was not tested in the presence of S9. Phenylephrine hydrochloride induced sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) but not chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The increase in SCEs was seen only in the absence of metabolic activation with S9. An audit of the experimental data was conducted for the 2-year studies of phenylephrine hydrochloride. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Under the conditions of these 2-year studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity of phenylephrine hydrochloride for male B6C3F1 mice given 1,250 or 2,500 ppm in feed. Survival of high dose male rats was greater than of high dose male rats was greater than that of controls, and the incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia and pheochromocytomas were lower in dosed than in control male rats. Inflammation was observed more frequently in the liver and prostate gland of dosed male rats than in controls.

1580,"Incomplete combustion of kerosene heater, and fuel gas and liquefied petroleum gas-burner emissions produces indoor pollutants that may be carcinogenic. The incomplete-combustion products from each type of appliance were therefore collected by adsorption on about 3 g of XAD-2 resin, and were extracted with benzene-methanol as a solvent for determination and identification of mutagens in the Salmonella-microsome test system. Benzene-methanol extracts of the particulates generated by a heater and two burners showed extreme mutagenicity for strains TA97 and TA98 without S9 mix. Based on the results of analysis, a combination of high performance liquid chromatography (h.p.l.c.) and gas chromatography (GC), about 40-80% of the direct-acting mutagenicity in each crude extract showed the same h.p.l.c. and GC retention times as dinitropyrenes (1,3-, 1,6- and 1,8-isomers), and 1-nitropyrene. Moreover, other nitroarenes, 2-nitrofluorene, 1,5- and 1,8-dinitronaphthalene, and 4,4'-dinitrobiphenyl, were detectable in almost all samples, but their contribution to the mutagenicity of each extract was very low. Kerosene heaters were found to generate small amounts (0.2 ng/h) of dinitropyrenes, which are potential mutagens/carcinogens, only after 1 h of operation.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1581,"Two pesticides, the fungicide Endodan (ethylene thiuram monosulphide) and the insecticide-acaricide Kilacar (bis(parachlorophenyl)cyclopropyl methanol), produced or used in the neighbouring countries of Bulgaria and Greece were investigated in a coordinated research programme for their genotoxic effects in a variety of test systems. This included the Ames test, Aspergillus nidulans for mitotic segregation, in vitro human lymphocyte cell cultures for SCE and chromosomal aberrations, in vivo bone marrow cells in hamsters and rats and the dominant lethal test in rats. The genotoxicity of Endodan was found to range from negative to slightly positive in different test systems. At concentrations of 7.5 and 12.0 micrograms/plate together with S9 mix it induced base-pair substitutions in the TA100 strain of Salmonella typhimurium at a rather low level. At a dose of 93 mg/kg b.w. it also caused chromosomal aberrations in acutely treated hamster bone marrow cells. A significant increase of SCE was also found in human lymphocyte cultures at a concentration of 20.0 micrograms/ml. Endodan was found to be negative in A. nidulans for somatic segregation, lymphocyte cultures for chromosomal aberrations and mitotic activity and in rats for dominant lethals and chromosomal aberrations. Kilacar was found to be a weak mutagen in the TA97 strain of S. typhimurium at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 micrograms/plate together with S9 mix. At concentrations of 1.0, 1.5 and 2 micrograms/ml Kilacar increased the number of mitotic segregants in A. nidulans by 160%, 220% and 156% respectively over the control. In Syrian hamster bone marrow cells after acute administration at concentrations of 0, 40, 80 and 160 mg/kg, the MI was 5.50, 4.30, 3.10 and 1.30 respectively, and an increase in chromosomal aberrations of about 300% over the control was observed with a concentration of 80 mg/kg. In human lymphocytes no significant changes were observed in either MI or SCE. In the dominant lethal test after chronic treatment of male rats at doses of 5.1, 10.2 and 102.0 mg/kg b.w. no significant mutagenic effect was found although a decrease was shown in the percentage of females with implants mated with treated males in the first week.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False

A single product was detected with each epoxide, and these products had the same retention times on silica high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). UV spectra of the products identified them as 3-alkylthymidines, and this was confirmed by infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. Mass spectra (MS) analysis showed the products to be consistent with attachment at the least substituted carbon of the epoxide.

1583,"In a comparative study on 135 compounds of various chemical classes, 30 agents inducing direct nonreparable DNA damage in repair-deficient E. coli failed in reverting strains TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98 and TA100 of S. typhimurium (De Flora et al., 1984b). These compounds were re-assayed in the Ames test using strains TA97 and TA102. A dose-dependent mutagenic response was detected with aminoantipyrine and p-rosaniline in TA97 and with streptomycin and formaldehyde in TA102. p-Rosaniline was the only mutagen requiring metabolic activation. 5 compounds, i.e. o-aminophenol in TA97 and methanol, ethanol, cadmium chloride and cadmium sulfate in TA102, induced a reproducible increase in revertants over controls, but this was less than 2-fold. The remaining 21 chemicals--including amino compounds, aliphatics, aromatics, heterocycles, hydrazine derivatives and inorganics--confirmed their inactivity in the Ames test. Overall data for 135 compounds, comparing the Ames test (7 strains) and the DNA-repair test (3 strains), are re-assessed on the basis of these findings.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA100 or TA1535 or TA102 or TA98 or TA1537 strain?,False
1584,"Animal model studies suggest that diets containing Laminaria angustata, a brown seaweed commonly eaten in Japan, inhibit breast carcinogenesis. In order to identify the compound(s) in the seaweed responsible for tumor-inhibiting activity, we used Ames/mammalian microsome assay system to determine the antimutagenic (or anticarcinogenic) effect of various solvents and water extracts of Laminaria angustata. The antimutagenic effects of acetone, ether, chloroform, chloroform + methanol, hot water and cold water extracts on the mutagenicity induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), a breast carcinogen, and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB), a colon and breast carcinogen, was studied using the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. All extracts were nonmutagenic in both bacterial tester strains. The addition of 10-100 mg solvent extracts of seaweed/plate greatly inhibited DMAB-induced mutagenicity in both tester strains (80-96% inhibition) and DMBA-induced mutagenicity in TA100 (about 82%), whereas hot and cold water extracts produced a moderate inhibition in a dose-related manner in both strains.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1585,"Stack-collected coal fly ash from western low-sulfur coal was extracted with 60:40 benzene/methanol. This extract was fractionated by preparative-scale high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the mutagenic activity of 14 fractions was evaluated by microbial assay with Salmonella typhimurium TA1538. A widespread distribution of direct-acting mutagens, which probably includes both mono- and dinitroaromatics, was detected. HPLC methods were also used to isolate 1-nitropyrene from the total benzene/methanol extract. The identification of 1-nitropyrene was based on gas chromatographic and HPLC retention measurements and mass spectral data. The concentration of 1-nitropyrene in the ash extract was determined by quantitative HPLC analyses. Mutagenicity assays of the total extract and an authentic 1-nitropyrene standard with Salmonella strains TA1538, TA100, and TA98 indicated that the 1-nitropyrene accounts for approximately 0.03-0.16% of the total mutagenic activity of the extract.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1586,"The sediments of Nagara river and its bystreams were extracted with ether. The mutagenicities of the extracts were determined by the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA100 with S9 mix. The extracts were fractionated on an activated silica-gel column with four kinds of organic solvent, namely iso-octane, iso-octane:benzene (1:1), benzene:ethyl acetate (1:1) and benzene:methanol (1:1). The highest mutagenicity was observed in the iso-octane-benzene fraction of Arata river by using TA100 with S9 mix. Chemical substances in this fraction were identified by GC-MS and GC, and several kinds of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were found. Several peaks were unidentified, but these PAH, especially benzo [b] fluoranthene and benzo [a] pyrene, may contribute substantially to the mutagenicity of this fraction.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
1587,"The mutagenic activities of 2 hydroxyxanthones, gentisin and isogentisin, obtained from the methanol extract of Gentianae radix (Gentianaceae) were investigated. The methanol extract of Gentianae radix, which showed mutagenicity in the Ames test in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 with S9 mix, was fractionated by column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20, and the fractions were purified by preparative TLC and column chromatography on polyamide. 2 mutagenic materials thus obtained, S1 and S2, each gave a single band on TLC. Identification of S1 and S2 was accomplished by comparing the analytical (mps, elementary analyses) and spectral (UV, IR, mass, NMR) results for S1 and S2 with literature data for gentisin and isogentisin. At doses below 10 micrograms, S1 (gentisin) and S2 (isogentisin) had similar specific mutagenic activities. At doses of over 10 to 50 micrograms, the mutagenic activities of S2 and S1 were 19.1 and 6.94 revertants per microgram respectively. This much lower activity of S1 than S2 may be a result of its poor solubility owing to the presence of the OMe group at C-3. The combined yield of S1 and S2 was about 76 mg (40 mg as S1 and 36 mg as S2), which accounted for 76% of the content of mutagenic compounds (100 mg) estimated roughly from the total mutagenic activity in the extract of the starting materials (100 g).",Is methanol mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
1588,"The Ames assay was used to investigate the mutagenicity of several phthalate esters as an approximation of their carcinogenic potential. The ortho diesters, dimethyl phthalate (DMP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP) produced a positive dose-related mutagenic response with Salmonella TA100, but only in the absence of S-9 liver enzymes. Dibutyl, di(2-ethylhexyl), mono(2-ethylhexyl), and butyl benzyl phthalate as well as the dimethyl isophthalate and terephthalates and the trimethyl ester, trimellitate, were not mutagenic with TA100 or TA98 in the presence or absence of S-9. In a host-mediated assay, extracts of 24-hr urines of rats injected IP with DMP (2 g/kg) were not mutagenic to TA100 at levels up to 8 equivalent-ml of urine/plate (representing 30% of their daily urinary output). In vitro studies revealed that S-9 associated esterase hydrolyzed DMP to the monoester and methanol and eliminated its mutagenicity. Whole rat skin was shown to have about 1.5% of the DMP-esterase activity of liver, when compared on a wet weight basis. An in vitro binding study indicated that epidermal macromolecules bound DMP at a severalfold greater rate than hepatic macromolecules. Thus, both the mutagenicity and binding of DMP are inversely related to the metabolism of this compound. These results suggest that skin could be at high risk for a mutagenic/carcinogenic insult.",Is methanol mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1589,"Workplaces of an Italian carbon electrode factory, exposed to petroleum pitch and petroleum coke, were studied using a coupled chemical and biological approach to evaluate occupational mutagenic/carcinogenic hazards. Analytical procedures for the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity tests (with TA98 and TA100 strains) were performed on both industrial ingredients (pitch and coke) and airborne particulate matter of the working environment, after fractionating by sequential Soxhlet extractions with four organic solvents of increasing polarity (benzene, chloroform, methanol and acetone). The results showed: (a) the presence of extraordinarily high PAH (carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic) contents in the benzene extracts of petroleum pitch (3.6 wt% of total PAH) and of airborne particulate samples (up to 0.35 wt% of total PAH), in correlation with very high indirect (after metabolic activation) mutagenic responses of benzene extracts with strain TA98; (b) very high indirect mutagenic responses in the other extracts of the airborne particulate samples (especially with strain TA98); (c) the production during the processing at high temperatures of directly acting mutagens (without metabolic activation) which were absent in the starting materials and their release in the air of workplaces. The comparison of chemical analytical and mutagenicity data has proved to be an interesting approach for better defining the relative health hazards due to occupational exposure to potentially mutagenic/carcinogenic petroleum products.","Is petroleum pitch, petroleum coke mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?",True
1590,"Chemical fractions from 4 shale oils including one produced in an above-ground retort (Paraho), 2 produced below ground by in situ method (Occidental and Geokinetics), and 1 produced by a simulated modified in situ process (Livermore), were tested for mutagenicity against Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames assay system. Their mutagenic activities were compared with 2 other complex materials: a high-boiling coal distillate (The Solvent Refined Coal Process I (SRC II) heavy distillate), and a crude petroleum (Prudhoe Bay). Each material was fractionated by Sephadex LH-20 partition chromatography and by acid-base solvent extraction to provide chemical fractions for bioassay. Mutagenic activity was detected in the coal liquid (and their fractions), but not in the natural crude oil nor in any of its fractions. The basic and tar fractions derived by solvent extraction, and the LH-20 methanol fractions contained most of the mutagenic activity recovered from the unfractionated material. The heavy distillate was approx. 10 times more active in the Ames assay than the most mutagenically active shale oil. The most mutagenically active of the shale oils was about 10 times more active than the least active shale oil.",Is coal liquid mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

Isorhamnetin 3-sulfate (persicarin) and quercetin 3-sulfate were characterized as the mutagenic principles. Carcinogenicity was not observed for dill weed and seeds when the diets containing these in 33% were administered for 450 and 410 days, respectively, to the inbred strain ACI rats.","Is dill weed, dill seeds mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?",True
1592,"The role of diets in causing cancers necessitates the ongoing search for natural antimutagens of promising anticancer therapeutics. This study determined the potential anticancer efficacy of the leaf extract of Myristica fragrans (Houtt.). Methanol leaf extract of M. fragrans (Houtt.) alone was screened for mutagenicity in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test, using the Salmonella typhimurium TA100 strain, the Allium cepa, and the mouse in vivo bone marrow micronucleus tests. The antimutagenicity of this extract against benzo[a]pyrene- and cyclophosphamide-induced mutations was evaluated. An antioxidant test on the extract was performed with 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, using butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) as the standards, whereas its phytochemicals were elucidated by following the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry protocol. In S. typhimurium (TA100), the mutagenicity ratio at 200,500 and 1,000 µg/well was >2. Cell division in the A. cepa root tips and mouse bone marrow was significantly (P ≤ 0.05) inhibited at 2,000 and 4,000 mg/kg, whereas the observed chromosomal aberrations and micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes were non-dose-related and were insignificantly (P ≥ 0.05) different from the negative control. Inhibition of benzo[a]pyrene- and cyclophosphamide-induced mutagenicity by this extract was above 40%. Half-maximal inhibitory concentration of the extract in the antioxidant test was lower than that of BHA and BHT. Phytochemical compounds, possessing antioxidant activity, may be responsible for the observed effects, suggesting a strong antimutagenic activity of the MeOH leaf extract of M. fragrans, a necessary characteristic of a promising anticancer agent.",Is MeOH leaf extract of M. fragrans mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False
1593,"The mutagenic potential of total aqueous, total oligomers flavonoids (TOF), ethyl acetate (EA), chloroform (Chl), petroleum ether (PE) and methanol (MeOH) extracts from aerial parts of Moricandia arvensis was assessed using Ames Salmonella tester strains TA100 and TA1535 with and without metabolic activation (S9), and using plasmid pBluescript DNA assay. None of the different extracts produced a mutagenic effect, except aqueous extract when incubated with Salmonella typhimurium TA100 after metabolic activation. Likewise, the antimutagenicity of the same extracts was tested using the ""Ames test"". Our results showed that M. arvensis extracts possess antimutagenic effects against sodium azide (SA) in the two tested Salmonella assay systems, except metabolized aqueous and PE extracts when tested with S. typhimurium TA100 assay system. Different extracts were also found to be effective in protecting plasmid DNA against the strand breakage induced by hydroxyl radicals, except PE and aqueous extracts. Antioxidant capacity of the tested extracts was evaluated using the enzymatic (xanthine/xanthine oxidase assay) (X/XOD) and the non enzymatic (NBT/Riboflavine assay) systems.

Juss. species is a native arboreal type from the Brazilian ""cerrado"" (tropical American savanna), and the local population uses it to treat diseases, such as diarrhea and gastric ulcer. It belongs to the Malpighiaceae family, and it is commonly known as ""murici."" Considering the popular use of B. basiloba derivatives and the lack of pharmacological potential studies regarding this vegetal species, the mutagenic and antimutagenic effect of methanol (MeOH) and chloroform extracts were evaluated by the Ames test, using strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA102 of Salmonella typhimurium. No mutagenic activity was observed in any of the extracts. To evaluate the antimutagenic potential, direct and indirect mutagenic agents were used: 4 nitro-o-phenylenediamine, sodium azide, mitomycin C, aflatoxin B(1), benzo[a]pyrene, and hydrogen peroxide. Both the extracts evaluated showed antimutagenic activity, but the highest value of inhibition level (89%) was obtained with the MeOH extract and strain TA100 in the presence of aflatoxin B(1). Phytochemical analysis of the extracts revealed the presence of n-alkanes, lupeol, ursolic and oleanolic acid, (+)-catechin, quercetin-3-O-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside, gallic acid, methyl gallate, amentoflavone, quercetin, quercetin-3-O-(2""-O-galloyl)-beta-D-galactopyranoside, and quercetin-3-O-(2""-O-galloyl)-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside.",Is MeOH extract of B. basiloba mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
1595,"The MeOH extract of Pueraria thunbergiana (Leguminosae) flowers and its fractions were subjected to Ames test to test the antimutagenicity. EtOAc fraction (1 mg/plate) decreased the number of revertants of Salmonella typhymurium TA100 by 95% against aflatoxin B, (AFB1). Phytochemical isolation of the EtOAc fraction afforded four isoflavonoids (tectorigenin, glycitein, tectoridin and glycitin) and one saponin (kaikasaponin III). Though the three isoflavonoids other than tectoridin showed significant antimutagenicity, the activity of kaikasaponin III was the most potent. Kaikasaponin III (1 mg/plate) decreased the number of revertants of S. typhymurium TA100 by 99% against AFB, but by 75% against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Tectorigenin (1 mg/plate) inhibited the AFB1-induced mutagenicity by 90% and MNNG-induced one by 76%. Glycitein and glycitin were less active than tectorigenin and kaikasaponin III. This result suggested that kaikasponin III prevents the metabolic activation of AFB1 and scavenge electrophilic intermediate capable of mutation. The two components with potent activities, tectorigenin and kaikasaonin III, significantly prevented the malondialdehyde formation caused by bromobenzene in the rat.",Is MeOH mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False

The number of revertants per plate was significantly decreased when a MeOH extract of Eriobotrya japonica was added to the assay system using Salmonella typhimurium TA100 or TA98. Furthermore, we examined the effect of each fraction purified from the MeOH extract, and an EtOAc fraction was found to be the most effective. Ursolic acid isolated from the EtOAc fraction markedly and significantly decreased the numbers of Salmonella typhimurium TA100 revertants per plate, thus showing antimutagenic activity.",Is Ursolic acid mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False
1597,"The nitrosation rates of indole-3-acetonitrile, indole-3-carbinol, indole and 4-chloroindole and the stability of their nitrosated products were investigated. Each of the nitrosated indole compounds was directly mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium TA100 in the following order of potency: 4-chloroindole much greater than indole-3-carbinol greater than or equal to indole greater than indole-3-acetonitrile. Total N-nitroso determinations, carried out according to a modified method of Walters et al. (Analyst, Lond. 1978, 103, 1127), and Ames test results revealed that each of the indole compounds immediately formed mutagenic N-nitroso products upon nitrite treatment under acidic conditions. However, the nitrosation rates of indole and 4-chloroindole were higher than those of indole-3-acetonitrile and indole-3-carbinol. For indole-3-carbinol, indole-3-acetonitrile and indole, no change in the amount of nitrosated products was observed at increasing incubation times from about 15 up to 60 min. For 4-chloroindole the amount of nitrosated products decreased with increasing incubation times. In all cases the responses in the Ames test paralleled the amounts of nitrosated products. The stabilities of the nitrosated products of the indole compounds were investigated at pH 2 and 8. Both mutagenicity data and measurements by high-performance liquid chromatography using a photohydrolysis detector indicated that the nitrosation products of indole-3-acetonitrile, indole-3-carbinol and indole were more stable at pH 8 than at pH 2. Conversely, nitrosated 4-chloroindole was stable at pH 2 but not at pH 8. The pH 8 chromatograms showed a large nitrite peak. From this we hypothesized that the presence of free nitrite might be responsible for the stability of nitrosated indole-3-acetonitrile, indole-3-carbinol and indole at pH 8. Experiments confirmed the existence of an equilibrium between the nitrosated indole compound and the free indole compound plus nitrite.","Is indole-3-acetonitrile, indole-3-carbinol, indole, 4-chloroindole mutagenic for TA100 strain?",True

Particularly biochar derived from pyrolysis attaches important agricultural capacities mandatory for an improved carbon sequestration, soil fertility and amelioration, respectively. In fact, large scale field trials and commercial business with biochar materials have already been started but still only few are known about the mutagenic potential of biochars produced. In this study hemp bedding and wood pellet biomass were used for biochar production by pyrolysis. The total concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were 34.9µgg(-1) of dry mass and 33.7µgg(-1) of dry mass for hemp biochar and wood biochar, respectively. The concentration of PAHs in tar produced during wood carbonization was 17.4µgg(-1). The concentrations of phenolic compounds were 55µgg(-1) and 8.3µgg(-1) for hemp and wood biochar, respectively. Salmonella/microsomal mutagenicity tests (i.e. Ames test) revealed a maximum mutagenicity for hemp biochar extracts with strains TA97, TA98 and TA100 in the presence and absence of liver microsomal fractions, respectively. Wood biochar and tar extract exhibited maximum mutagenicity with strains TA98 and T100 both in the presence and absence of liver microsomal fraction. The reversion of the applied tester strains increased in the presence and absence of liver microsomal fractions with an increasing dose of hemp biochar extract up to 2µl per plate and decreased at a concentration of 2.5µl per plate. For wood biochar and tar extracts, reversion of tester strains increased both in the presence and absence of S9 at extract concentrations of 4µl per plate and declined at a dose of 8µl per plate. By this study a significant higher mutagenic potential for hemp biochar compared to wood biochar and tar could be observed suggesting careful application in soil melioration.",Is hemp biochar and tar extract mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
1600,"o-Chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS), a riot control agent, was evaluated for its possible mutagenic activity in the Ames Salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity test. Five histidine-deficient (His-) mutant tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium--TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102 and TA104--were used. The liquid preincubation procedure was used with metabolic activation (presence of S9 mixture) and without metabolic activation (absence of S9 mixture). For the experiments with metabolic activation, three different concentrations of S9 fraction (supernatant of Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver homogenate at 9000 g)--5%, 15% and 30% in S9 mixture--were used. Along with mutagenic activity, CS was also evaluated for cytotoxic activity in all the five tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium, both in the presence and absence of S9 mixture. The mutagenic and cytotoxic activities of CS were assessed by counting the His+ revertant colonies and by counting the microcolonies (His-, auxotrophs in the background lawn), respectively, and the respective mean values were compared with the relative negative (solvent) control. A dose range of 12.5-800 micrograms plate-1 for CS did not induce a mutagenic response either in the presence or absence of S9 mix. No change in the negative mutagenic response of CS has been observed even in the presence of an elevated level of S9 fraction in the S9 mix. A dose of 200 micrograms plate-1 for CS was found to be cytotoxic by decreasing the surviving cells as well as His+ revertant colonies; however, the effect was reduced in the presence of an elevated level of S9 fraction in the S9 mix.",Is o-Chlorobenzylidene malononitrile mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,False
1601,"Nitro-containing compounds such as nitrofuran and nitroimidazole are drugs used for the treatment of infectious diseases. However, many of these nitro-containing drugs are positive in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test). The recently approved anti-multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) drug, delamanid (Deltyba™; OPC-67683), a derivative of 4-nitroimidazole, was negative for mutagenicity in the Ames assay. In Salmonella typhimurium, mutagenicity of nitro compounds has been closely associated with the ability of nitroreductase to metabolize (degradation)these compounds. To explore the lack of mutagenicity for delamanid, we examined the initial metabolic rate and mutagenic-specific activity of a series of nitro compounds in S. typhimurium TA100. The order of maximum mutagenic-activity was nitrofuran > 2-nitroimidazole > 5-nitroimidazole ≥ 4-nitroimidazole, which is very similar to the order of initial metabolic rate, i.e., the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r = 0.85) showed a correlation between metabolic rate and mutagenic-activity. No metabolism of delamanid was detected even after 60 h of treatment. In addition, delamanid was not reduced by two human nitroreductases. These facts may explain the absence of genotoxicity of delamanid in both in vitro and in vivo tests.",Is delamanid mutagenic for TA100 strain?,False

At low doses no mutagenicity was detected with strains TA100NR, TA98 or UTH8414 (Uvr+ derivative of TA100). Urine from four patients under tinidazole treatment exhibited a mutagenic activity on strain TA100, greater than the expected from the tinidazole concentrations determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Components from the urine samples were separated on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates, and their mutagenic effects tested by direct application of the Salmonella assay onto sections of the developed chromatoplate. The Rf of one component (0.62) corresponded to the one obtained for a tinidazole standard and showed the expected mutagenicity, while a second component with an Rf=0.39, exhibited a mutagenic potency slightly greater than the observed for tinidazole; however, as in the case of the drug itself, reduction of the nitro group was necessary for a mutagenic activity.",Is Tinidazole mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True

No mutagenicity or toxicity in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 was observed with any tea extract. The tea extracts markedly inhibited the mutagenicity of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoline, 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyridol(4,3-b)indole,2-amino-6-methyldipyrido(l,2-a:3',2'-d)imidazole, benzo[a]pyrene, and aflatoxin B1 toward S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100 in the presence of S9 mixture, especially those of oolong and pouchong teas inhibited over 90% mutagenicity of these five mutagens at the dosage of 1 mg per plate. Among four tea extracts, black tea exhibited the weakest inhibitory effect on mutagenicity of these five mutagens. The mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, a direct mutagen, was not inhibited by black and oolong tea extracts to S. typhimurium TA98 in the absence of S9 mixture but was increased by the tea extracts at the dose of 1 mg per plate to S. typhimurium TA100.

1608,"Heterocyclic aromatic amines, derived from the pyrolysis of amino acids and proteins, are potent mutagens in the Ames Salmonella assay with rodent liver activation. Additionally, heterocyclic aromatic amines are multipotent carcinogens. We report evidence that these compounds are substrates for the hydroperoxidase activity of prostaglandin H synthase, as measured by alterations in UV/visible spectra, and are bioactivated to macromolecule-reactive species by this enzyme. Indirect electron paramagnetic resonance studies indicate that this activation may occur via a one-electron mechanism. 2-Amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) are direct-acting mutagens in TA98. The mutagenicity of IQ and MeIQ, but not Trp-P-2, were enhanced by activation with ram seminal vesicle microsomes (a rich source of prostaglandin H synthase). Subsequent experiments utilized the newly constructed tester strain TA1538/1,8-DNP6 (pYG 121), which has enhanced arylamine N-acetyltransferase activity. In this strain IQ, MeIQ and 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido-[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1) were mutagenic with ram seminal vesicle microsome activation. 3-Amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) was a weak direct-acting mutagen, and was not activated by the ram seminal vesicles (RSV) system. The responses of IQ and MeIQ were markedly enhanced in TA1538/1.8-DNP6 (pYG 121), relative to TA98.

1611,"2-Hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (HNQ; Lawsone; CAS 83-72-7) is the principal natural dye ingredient contained in the leaves of Henna (Lawsonia inermis). Published genotoxicity studies on HNQ suggested it was a weak bacterial mutagen for Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 or was more clearly mutagenic for strain TA 2637, both in the presence of metabolic activation. HNQ was unable to induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster. However, a small increase in micronucleus frequency was reported in the bone marrow of mice at a single mid-range dose level, 24h after intraperitoneal injection. In view of the wide use of Henna hair dyes it was deemed necessary to conduct a thorough investigation, under Good Laboratory Practice conditions, of the genotoxicity of HNQ. HNQ was non-mutagenic in bacterial (Ames test) or mammalian (V79 hprt) assays. It was borderline positive in a mouse lymphoma tk mutation assay and a chromosome aberration test (CHO cells), results that may reflect a similar clastogenic mechanism. Negative in vivo genotoxicity results were noted in the rat hepatocyte in vivo/in vitro UDS test, in peripheral lymphocytes (chromosome aberrations) of rats receiving repeated oral doses of HNQ at the MTD for 28 days, and in mouse and hamster bone marrow chromosome aberration tests. However small, but statistically significant increases in the incidence of bone marrow micronuclei were observed in two out of five tests at 72 h after dosing, but not at 24 or 48 h. There was evidence of haematotoxicity at 72 h, which may have been enhanced by the vehicle (DMSO) used in the positive tests. As erythropoiesis and administration of haematotoxic agents are known to induce small increases in the frequency of bone marrow micronuclei, typically at delayed sampling times, the data suggest that the positive 72 h response produced by HNQ is consistent with stimulation of haematopoiesis subsequent to haematological toxicity of HNQ, and not due to a DNA-reactive mechanism.

Published genotoxicity studies on HNQ suggested it was a weak bacterial mutagen for Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 or was more clearly mutagenic for strain TA 2637, both in the presence of metabolic activation. HNQ was unable to induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster. However, a small increase in micronucleus frequency was reported in the bone marrow of mice at a single mid-range dose level, 24h after intraperitoneal injection. In view of the wide use of Henna hair dyes it was deemed necessary to conduct a thorough investigation, under Good Laboratory Practice conditions, of the genotoxicity of HNQ. HNQ was non-mutagenic in bacterial (Ames test) or mammalian (V79 hprt) assays. It was borderline positive in a mouse lymphoma tk mutation assay and a chromosome aberration test (CHO cells), results that may reflect a similar clastogenic mechanism. Negative in vivo genotoxicity results were noted in the rat hepatocyte in vivo/in vitro UDS test, in peripheral lymphocytes (chromosome aberrations) of rats receiving repeated oral doses of HNQ at the MTD for 28 days, and in mouse and hamster bone marrow chromosome aberration tests. However small, but statistically significant increases in the incidence of bone marrow micronuclei were observed in two out of five tests at 72 h after dosing, but not at 24 or 48 h. There was evidence of haematotoxicity at 72 h, which may have been enhanced by the vehicle (DMSO) used in the positive tests. As erythropoiesis and administration of haematotoxic agents are known to induce small increases in the frequency of bone marrow micronuclei, typically at delayed sampling times, the data suggest that the positive 72 h response produced by HNQ is consistent with stimulation of haematopoiesis subsequent to haematological toxicity of HNQ, and not due to a DNA-reactive mechanism.

1615,"There are few studies on the biological activity of aminohydroxy derivates of 1,4-naphthoquinone (1,4-NQ) on prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. We determined the mutagenic activity of 5-amino-8-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (ANQ) and 5-amino-2,8-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (ANQ-OH) as compared to the unsubstituted 1,4-NQ in Salmonella/microsome assay. Potential mutagenic and recombinogenic effects and cytotoxicity were analyzed in haploid and diploid cultures of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In Salmonella/microsome assay, 1,4-NQ was not mutagenic, whereas aminohydroxynaphthoquinones were weakly mutagenic in TA98 and TA102 strains. In haploid yeast in stationary growth phase (STAT), mutagenic response was only observed for the hom3 locus at the highest dose. In diploid yeast, aminohydroxynaphthoquinones did not induce any recombinogenic events, but 1,4-NQ was shown to be a recombinogenic agent. These results suggest that aminohydroxynaphthoquinones are weak mutagenic agents only in prokaryotic cells. The cytotoxicity of 1,4-NQ in yeast stationary cells was more significant in diploid cells as compared to that observed in haploid cells. However, ANQ and ANQOH were slightly cytotoxic in all treatments. Genotoxicity of these naphthoquinone compounds was also determined in V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells using standard Comet, as well as modified Comet assay with the bacterial enzymes formamidopyrimidine DNA-glycosylase (FPG) and endonuclease III (ENDOIII). Both 1,4-NQ and ANQ induced pronounced DNA damage in the standard Comet assay. The genotoxic effect of ANQ-OH was observed only at the highest dose. In presence of metabolic activation all substances showed genotoxic effects on V79 cells. Post-treatment of V79 cells with ENDOIII and FPG proteins did not have a significant effect on ANQ-OH-induced oxidative DNA damage as compared to standard alkaline Comet assay. However, all naphthoquinones were genotoxic in V79 cells in the presence of metabolic activation and post-treatment with enzymes, indicating that all compounds induced oxidative DNA damage in V79 cells. Our data suggest that aminohydroxynaphthoquinone pro-oxidant activity, together with their capability of DNA intercalation, have an important role in mutagenic and genotoxic activities.",Is NQ mutagenic for TA98 or TA102 strain?,True
1616,"Nitro reduction is a critical step in the mutagenic activation of nitroarene. Nitroarene and quinone are known to be reduced by common enzymes, and thus, naphthoquinone (NQ) was studied for its effects on the mutagenicity of nitroarene in the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 without S9. The mutagenicity of 1,3-dinitropyrene in TA98 was found to increase 9- and 6-fold as much in the presence of 70 nmol/plate of 2-methyl-1,4-NQ and 2-hydroxy-1,4-NQ, respectively. Mutagenicity also became greater in 1,3,5-trinitronaphthalene, 1-nitropyrene and 3-nitrofluoranthene.

1617,"P-Benzoquinone dioxime (BQD) appears to be a sex-specific rat carcinogen inducing tumours of the urinary bladder in female rats. The present paper shows that BQD is a direct-acting mutagen in Salmonella typhimurium TA98, confirming published data. In contrast to this in vitro data, negative results were obtained after oral administration of BQD to female rats in both the bone marrow micronucleus test and the in vivo liver UDS test. BQD did, however, induce a marked effect upon S-phase synthesis in the livers of female rats between 14 and 48 hr after a single oral dose of 250 mg/kg. A similar effect was also observed in the livers of male rats. There was no evidence of hepatotoxicity (in terms of elevated liver enzyme levels) after treatment of female rats with the compound indicating that the increase in cell proliferation was due to a direct mitogenic effect of BQD in this organ. Some liver mitogens have been found to be liver carcinogens; this does not appear to be the case for BQD. Nevertheless, the mitogenic activity of this compound might play a contributory role to the induction of bladder cancer in rats if it also acted as a mitogen in this tissue. Further studies are indicated, measuring genotoxicity and cell-proliferative activity in the bladder in order to further elucidate the mechanism of action of this compound as a rodent carcinogen.",Is BQD mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True

Genotoxicity was assessed in mice by Ames test in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102, by bone marrow micronucleus test and sperm abnormality. Thirty-day subacute toxicity was conducted with oral daily dose at 0, 0.56, 1.13 and 2.25g/kg body weight in rats. No significant changes in body weight, food intake, behavior, mortality, hematology, blood biochemistry, vital organ weight, sperm abnormality, mutagenicity and micronucleus formation were observed and no clinical signs or adverse effects were detected by administration of CoQ10.

1619,"Eight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) ortho-quinones that can be generated by dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DD) were examined for their cytotoxicity in H-4-II-e (rat hepatoma) cells and for their mutagenicity in the Ames test. Seven of the PAH otrtho-quinones were potent cytotoxins yielding IC50 values for cell survival in the range 1-30 microns. PAH ortho-quinones were grouped into three classes based on their cytotoxicity profiles: group I contained ortho-quinones (e.g., naphthalene-1,2-dione and 7,12-dimethylbenz[alpha]anthracene-3,4-dione) which reduced cell viability and cell survival; group II contained ortho-quinones (e.g., benz[alpha]anthracene-3,4-dione and 5-methylchrysene-1,2-dione which reduced cell survival but had no effect on cell viability; and group III contained ortho-quinones (e.g., benzo[alpha]pyrene-7,8-dione) which had a pronounced effect on cell viability but minimal effects on cell survival. Using hepatoma cell suspensions and rat liver subcellular fractions, it was found that ortho-quinones underwent preferential enzymatic one-electron redox-cycling and produced superoxide anion radical (O2-.) and/or ortho-semiquinone anion or alternant radicals. ortho-Quinones that reduced cell viability produced O2-. and caused the most total free radical formation, while those that reduced cell survival produced ortho-semiquinone anion or alternant radicals only. PAH ortho-quinones were also tested as direct-acting mutagens in Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102 and TA104. They were found to be more mutagenic than the test mutagens used for each tester strain, and were predominantly frameshift mutagens. The presence of an activating system (Aroclor-induced rat liver S9 plus NADPH) did not increase the mutagenicity of ortho-quinones in tester strains that are sensitive to oxidative mutagens (TA102 and TA104). These data suggest that PAH ortho-quinones produced by DD are cytotoxic and mutagenic by different mechanisms. The mechanism of cytotoxicity involves the formation of reactive oxygen species and/or ortho-semiquinone anion or alternant radicals. The mechanism of mutagenicity is independent of free radical formation and is related to the ability of PAH orthooffinones to intercalate and covalently modify DNA.",Is PAH ortho-quinones mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1620,"Chlorine gas was used to treat aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). The time-related exposure study showed that 4 ml (15 mg) pure chlorine gas caused about 90% destruction of 100 micrograms AFB1 within 10 min, at standard temperature and pressure. Four fluorescent reaction products were produced, two of which were identified as 8,9-dichloro-AFB1 and 8,9-dihydroxy-AFB1 (diol). The use of [14C]AFB1 confirmed the 90% destruction of the compound by chlorine gas. An increased destruction of AFB1 also occurred when an increased amount of chlorine gas was used. The mutagenic activity of the AFB1 sample treated for 10 min was reduced to about 5% of the untreated control using the Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the presence of a rat-liver S-9 mix. A similar time-related reduction in AFB1 toxicity after chlorine treatment was also achieved using the chicken embryo toxicity assay.",Is Chlorine gas mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False

1622,"Methyl isocyanate (MIC) in aqueous solution forms methylamine (MA) and N,N'-dimethylurea (DMU). MA in buffered system further converts into its salt form, methylamine hydrochloride (MAH). Therefore, MAH and DMU were evaluated for their mutagenic activity in the in vitro Ames Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test. The liquid preincubation protocol was followed, using tester strains TA98, TA100 and TA104 of Salmonella typhimurium, in the presence of 0, 5, 15 and 30% Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver S9 mixture. DMU and MAH did not induce a mutagenic response in any of the tester strains, both in the presence and in the absence of S9 mixture. The results therefore confirm that MIC in its native form or as its unknown metabolites is responsible for the mutagenic activity reported earlier by us in the his tester strains TA100 and TA104 of Salmonella typhimurium (Mutation Res., 204 (1988) 123-129) and not due to its hydrolysis products, MA or DMU.",Is MAH mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,False

1624,"The nature of mutagenic burden due to occupational exposure to tobacco flakes and dust was determined among 20 female tobacco processors (TP) and 20 matched controls (C) by testing urinary mutagenicity in the Ames assay. In addition, urinary cotinine was estimated as a marker of tobacco absorption. Workers and controls were sub-divided into those with no tobacco habit (NH) and those habituated to the use of masheri (a pyrolysed form of tobacco) as a dentifrice (MH). Cotinine was not detected in samples from C-NH while the mean urinary cotinine levels in TP-NH and TP-MH were significantly higher than that in C-MH (3.46 +/- 0.95 and 3.57 +/- 0.46 versus 1.80 +/- 0.58 mM/M creatinine; P < 0.02). The majority of the urine samples from C-NH were non-mutagenic in the presence or absence of rat liver S9 while those from C-H were mutagenic to TA98 and TA102 strains upon metabolic activation. On the other hand, direct mutagenicity to TA98, TA100 and TA102 strains respectively was noted in 6/10, 5/10 and 8/10 samples from TP-NH and 7/10, 4/10 and 3/10 samples from TP-M. Generally, beta-glucuronidase treatment reduced or abolished the mutagenic potential of workers' urine samples indicating that glucuronide conjugates may have partially contributed to direct mutagenicity. Experiments using scavengers of reactive oxygen species revealed that direct mutagenicity in TA102 strain was mediated mainly via hydroxyl radicals. The results clearly demonstrate that tobacco processors are exposed to a wide spectrum of mutagens that cause frame-shift, base pair substitution and oxidative damage.",Is MH mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1625,"Cigarette filters pose a serious litter and toxic waste disposal problem, because of their not biodegradability and to the leaching of toxins in the environment. Therefore, cigarette butts need to be manipulated as special waste, with potential risks to human health and environment. In the present study, the genotoxic potential of a methanol extract from commonly discharged cigarette butts (CBE) was evaluated in the bacterial reverse mutation assay on Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 and Escherichia coli WP2uvrA strains, both in the absence and presence of the S9 exogenous metabolic activator. Furthermore, the ability of the natural sesquiterpenes β-caryophyllene (CRY) and β-caryophyllene oxide (CRYO) to inhibit the mutagenicity of CBE was studied as a possible preventive strategy. In order to identify the potential antimutagenic mechanisms, three different protocols (pretreatment, cotreatment, and posttreatment) were applied. CBE showed to increase the number of revertant colonies in all the strains tested in presence of S9, so resulting mutagenic. In the antimutagenicity assay, both CRY and CRYO significantly reduced the revertant colonies induced by CBE, although with different potency and specificity. For both sesquiterpenes, the antimutagenicity was strong in all experimental conditions, except for the cotreatment of CRY with CBE in WP2uvrA, which produced a moderate inhibition. Both desmutagenic and bioantimutagenic mechanisms seem to be involved in the antimutagenicity of the test substances. Taking into account the potential genotoxicity of cigarette butts, CRY and CRYO appear as possible further candidates as environmental decontaminants against this hazardous waste. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the presence of an activating system, ethyl carbamate was found to be mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 but not in strains TA98 and TA102, indicating base-pair substitutions at G-C base pairs. In contrast, no significant mutagenicity of ethyl carbamate could be detected in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells. However, applied in cytotoxic concentrations, ethyl carbamate was genotoxic for Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the absence of P450-mediated metabolic activation.

1627,"Urethane, a byproduct of fermentation found in alcoholic beverages, is carcinogenic in rodents and is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a possible human carcinogen. The United States Food and Drug Administration nominated urethane for study because of the widespread exposure of humans through the consumption of fermented foods and beverages and because of a lack of adequate dose-response data about the carcinogenicity of urethane with and without the coadministration of ethanol. Comparative studies of urethane in drinking water and in 5% ethanol were conducted to investigate possible effects of ethanol on urethane toxicity. Toxicokinetic studies of urethane in drinking water and in 5% ethanol and genetic toxicity studies of urethane in vivo and in vitro were also conducted. Groups of 10 male and 10 female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice, 6 weeks of age, received 0, 110, 330, 1,100, 3,300, or 10,000 ppm urethane in drinking water or in 5% ethanol for 13 weeks. Toxicokinetic evaluations were performed for urethane in the plasma of male mice after 13 weeks of administration in drinking water or 5% ethanol. The mutagenicity of urethane in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 with and without S9 was tested at doses up to 16,666 micrograms/plate; urethane was also tested for induction of sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells and sex-linked recessive lethal mutations and chromosomal reciprocal translocations in Drosophila melanogaster. The frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes induced in peripheral blood and bone marrow cells of mice by urethane in drinking water and in 5% ethanol was also evaluated. In rats that received urethane in drinking water, seven males and four females administered 10,000 ppm and one female administered 3,300 ppm died before the end of the study; body weight gains were reduced at these concentrations. Two males and all females given 10,000 ppm urethane in 5% ethanol died during the study, and the body weight gains of males and females that received 3,300 ppm were lower than those of the controls. Relative right kidney, liver, and lung weights of males and females and relative right testis weights of males administered 1,100 ppm or greater were generally higher than those of the controls in each study. Leukopenia and lymphopenia were observed in rats receiving urethane in either drinking water or ethanol and occurred in males receiving 330 ppm or greater and females receiving 110 ppm or greater. Other differences in hematology and clinical chemistry variables were not considered to be biologically significant. Lymphoid depletion of the spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus was observed in male and female rats receiving 1,100, 3,300, or 10,000 ppm urethane in drinking water. Cellular depletion of the bone marrow occurred in males and females in the 10,000 ppm groups. Hepatocellular fatty changes and clear cell foci of alteration were noted in the liver of males and females that received 3,300 or 10,000 ppm. The incidences of nephropathy were significantly increased in female rats that received 1,100 ppm or greater; the severity of this lesion in exposed males and females was greater than that in the controls. Females that received 330 ppm or greater had higher incidences of cardiomyopathy than the controls; the severity of this lesion was greater in males in the 10,000 ppm group and females in the 3,300 and 10,000 ppm groups than in the controls. In rats that received urethane in 5% ethanol, lymphoid depletion occurred in males and females in the 3,300 and 10,000 ppm groups. Cellular depletion of the bone marrow was observed in males and females in the 10,000 ppm groups. Only males in the 10,000 ppm group had hepatocellular fatty change (8/10) and clear cell foci (1/10); the incidence and severity of nephropathy in males and females and cardiomyopathy in males were similar to those in rats administered urethane in drinking water; however, no cardiomyopathy was observed in females receiving urethane in ethanol. The estrous cycle length of females receiving urethane in ethanol appeared to be longer than that of females receiving urethane in drinking water. Because cycle length was longer in the 10,000 ppm groups than in the controls in both the drinking water and ethanol vehicle studies, this difference may represent an exacerbation of the toxicity of urethane. A longer estrous cycle may be a sign of reproductive impairment and correlates with a decrease in female fecundity. All mice administered 10,000 ppm urethane in either vehicle died. All mice that received 3,300 ppm urethane in drinking water died, while only one male and four females receiving 3,300 ppm urethane in 5% ethanol died. Body weight gains of males and females in all 1,100 ppm groups were less than those of the respective controls, but the weight gains of mice receiving 1,100 ppm urethane in 5% ethanol were greater than those of mice receiving urethane in drinking water. The mean body weights of the lower exposure groups were similar to those of the respective controls, and there were no other differences between the body weights of mice receiving urethane in drinking water and those receiving urethane in 5% ethanol. Fluid consumption, and therefore total urethane intake, appeared lower in mice receiving the 5% ethanol vehicle than in those receiving the water vehicle. The relative right kidney, liver, and lung weights of males and females administered urethane in drinking water or ethanol were generally greater than those of the controls. Clearance of urethane from the plasma of male mice was complete within 2 hours after urethane was administered in water, but urethane was not cleared 12 hours after administration in 5% ethanol. At the end of 13 weeks of urethane administration, the plasma urethane elimination half-life was 0.8 hours; the kinetics were similar for concentrations of 110, 330, and 1,100 ppm urethane in water and in ethanol. However, at each exposure level, the plasma urethane concentration was four times greater for urethane administered in 5% ethanol than for urethane administered in drinking water, indicating a possible inhibition of urethane metabolism by ethanol. Kinetic measurements for elimination by female mice could not be obtained from the data collected. In mice administered urethane in drinking water, lung inflammation occurred in males and females that received 1,100 ppm or greater. Alveolar epithelial hyperplasia occurred in the lungs of males in the 330 and 1,100 ppm groups and females in the 1,100 ppm group; one male mouse in the 330 ppm group had an alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma (see the following summary table). Mice receiving urethane in 5% ethanol had lower incidences and severity of lung inflammation but generally greater incidences and severity of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia than mice receiving the same concentrations of urethane in drinking water. Alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas occurred in four males and one female administered urethane in ethanol. [table: see text] Nephropathy was observed in males and females that received urethane in either vehicle, and the lesions in female mice were more severe than those in male mice; ethanol did not appear to increase the incidence or severity of nephropathy. Cardiomyopathy occurred in males and females that received 1,100 or 3,300 ppm urethane in drinking water and in females that received 3,300 ppm urethane in ethanol. Lymphoid depletion occurred in mice that received 3,300 or 10,000 ppm urethane; 5% ethanol did not appear to enhance these effects. However, urethane in 5% ethanol induced ovarian atrophy; the incidence of this lesion was lower in females receiving urethane in drinking water. A concentration of 1,100 ppm urethane in either drinking water or ethanol effectively stopped estrous cycling. Urethane is clearly genotoxic in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, urethane induced mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535 in the presence of liver S9 enzymes. Sister chromatid exchanges were induced in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with and without S9. However, no induction of chromosomal aberrations was observed in CHO cells treated with urethane, with or without S9. In vivo, urethane induced sex-linked recessive lethal mutations and reciprocal translocations in germ cells of adult male Drosophila melanogaster fed urethane. Significantly increased frequencies of micronucleated erythrocytes were observed in peripheral blood obtained from male and female mice after 45 days of exposure and in bone marrow and peripheral blood obtained after 13 weeks of exposure to urethane in drinking water. There appeared to be no significant difference in the magnitude of the response in the peripheral blood micronucleus test between mice administered urethane in drinking water and mice administered urethane in 5% ethanol. In summary, concentrations of 1,100 ppm urethane or greater in drinking water caused lymphoid and bone marrow cell depletion and hepatocellular lesions and increased the severity of nephropathy and cardiomyopathy in male and female rats. The lethal effects of 10,000 ppm urethane were slightly exacerbated by 5% ethanol in female rats. Urethane administered in drinking water induced lung inflammation, alveolar and bronchiolar hyperplasia, alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas, nephropathy, cardiomyopathy, lymphoid and bone marrow cell depletion, seminiferous tubule degeneration, and ovarian atrophy and follicular degeneration in mice. In female mice, 5% ethanol appeared to exacerbate ovarian atrophy. Mice administered urethane in 5% ethanol consumed less fluid, and therefore less urethane, than mice receiving urethane in drinking water. Coadministration of urethane and ethanol inhibited the clearance of urethane from plasma. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",Is Urethan mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True

Groups of 10 male and 10 female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice, 6 weeks of age, received 0, 110, 330, 1,100, 3,300, or 10,000 ppm urethane in drinking water or in 5% ethanol for 13 weeks. Toxicokinetic evaluations were performed for urethane in the plasma of male mice after 13 weeks of administration in drinking water or 5% ethanol. The mutagenicity of urethane in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 with and without S9 was tested at doses up to 16,666 micrograms/plate; urethane was also tested for induction of sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells and sex-linked recessive lethal mutations and chromosomal reciprocal translocations in Drosophila melanogaster. The frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes induced in peripheral blood and bone marrow cells of mice by urethane in drinking water and in 5% ethanol was also evaluated. In rats that received urethane in drinking water, seven males and four females administered 10,000 ppm and one female administered 3,300 ppm died before the end of the study; body weight gains were reduced at these concentrations. Two males and all females given 10,000 ppm urethane in 5% ethanol died during the study, and the body weight gains of males and females that received 3,300 ppm were lower than those of the controls. Relative right kidney, liver, and lung weights of males and females and relative right testis weights of males administered 1,100 ppm or greater were generally higher than those of the controls in each study. Leukopenia and lymphopenia were observed in rats receiving urethane in either drinking water or ethanol and occurred in males receiving 330 ppm or greater and females receiving 110 ppm or greater. Other differences in hematology and clinical chemistry variables were not considered to be biologically significant. Lymphoid depletion of the spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus was observed in male and female rats receiving 1,100, 3,300, or 10,000 ppm urethane in drinking water. Cellular depletion of the bone marrow occurred in males and females in the 10,000 ppm groups. Hepatocellular fatty changes and clear cell foci of alteration were noted in the liver of males and females that received 3,300 or 10,000 ppm. The incidences of nephropathy were significantly increased in female rats that received 1,100 ppm or greater; the severity of this lesion in exposed males and females was greater than that in the controls. Females that received 330 ppm or greater had higher incidences of cardiomyopathy than the controls; the severity of this lesion was greater in males in the 10,000 ppm group and females in the 3,300 and 10,000 ppm groups than in the controls. In rats that received urethane in 5% ethanol, lymphoid depletion occurred in males and females in the 3,300 and 10,000 ppm groups. Cellular depletion of the bone marrow was observed in males and females in the 10,000 ppm groups. Only males in the 10,000 ppm group had hepatocellular fatty change (8/10) and clear cell foci (1/10); the incidence and severity of nephropathy in males and females and cardiomyopathy in males were similar to those in rats administered urethane in drinking water; however, no cardiomyopathy was observed in females receiving urethane in ethanol. The estrous cycle length of females receiving urethane in ethanol appeared to be longer than that of females receiving urethane in drinking water. Because cycle length was longer in the 10,000 ppm groups than in the controls in both the drinking water and ethanol vehicle studies, this difference may represent an exacerbation of the toxicity of urethane. A longer estrous cycle may be a sign of reproductive impairment and correlates with a decrease in female fecundity. All mice administered 10,000 ppm urethane in either vehicle died. All mice that received 3,300 ppm urethane in drinking water died, while only one male and four females receiving 3,300 ppm urethane in 5% ethanol died. Body weight gains of males and females in all 1,100 ppm groups were less than those of the respective controls, but the weight gains of mice receiving 1,100 ppm urethane in 5% ethanol were greater than those of mice receiving urethane in drinking water. The mean body weights of the lower exposure groups were similar to those of the respective controls, and there were no other differences between the body weights of mice receiving urethane in drinking water and those receiving urethane in 5% ethanol. Fluid consumption, and therefore total urethane intake, appeared lower in mice receiving the 5% ethanol vehicle than in those receiving the water vehicle. The relative right kidney, liver, and lung weights of males and females administered urethane in drinking water or ethanol were generally greater than those of the controls. Clearance of urethane from the plasma of male mice was complete within 2 hours after urethane was administered in water, but urethane was not cleared 12 hours after administration in 5% ethanol. At the end of 13 weeks of urethane administration, the plasma urethane elimination half-life was 0.8 hours; the kinetics were similar for concentrations of 110, 330, and 1,100 ppm urethane in water and in ethanol. However, at each exposure level, the plasma urethane concentration was four times greater for urethane administered in 5% ethanol than for urethane administered in drinking water, indicating a possible inhibition of urethane metabolism by ethanol. Kinetic measurements for elimination by female mice could not be obtained from the data collected. In mice administered urethane in drinking water, lung inflammation occurred in males and females that received 1,100 ppm or greater. Alveolar epithelial hyperplasia occurred in the lungs of males in the 330 and 1,100 ppm groups and females in the 1,100 ppm group; one male mouse in the 330 ppm group had an alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma (see the following summary table). Mice receiving urethane in 5% ethanol had lower incidences and severity of lung inflammation but generally greater incidences and severity of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia than mice receiving the same concentrations of urethane in drinking water. Alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas occurred in four males and one female administered urethane in ethanol. [table: see text] Nephropathy was observed in males and females that received urethane in either vehicle, and the lesions in female mice were more severe than those in male mice; ethanol did not appear to increase the incidence or severity of nephropathy. Cardiomyopathy occurred in males and females that received 1,100 or 3,300 ppm urethane in drinking water and in females that received 3,300 ppm urethane in ethanol. Lymphoid depletion occurred in mice that received 3,300 or 10,000 ppm urethane; 5% ethanol did not appear to enhance these effects. However, urethane in 5% ethanol induced ovarian atrophy; the incidence of this lesion was lower in females receiving urethane in drinking water. A concentration of 1,100 ppm urethane in either drinking water or ethanol effectively stopped estrous cycling. Urethane is clearly genotoxic in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, urethane induced mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535 in the presence of liver S9 enzymes. Sister chromatid exchanges were induced in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with and without S9. However, no induction of chromosomal aberrations was observed in CHO cells treated with urethane, with or without S9. In vivo, urethane induced sex-linked recessive lethal mutations and reciprocal translocations in germ cells of adult male Drosophila melanogaster fed urethane. Significantly increased frequencies of micronucleated erythrocytes were observed in peripheral blood obtained from male and female mice after 45 days of exposure and in bone marrow and peripheral blood obtained after 13 weeks of exposure to urethane in drinking water. There appeared to be no significant difference in the magnitude of the response in the peripheral blood micronucleus test between mice administered urethane in drinking water and mice administered urethane in 5% ethanol. In summary, concentrations of 1,100 ppm urethane or greater in drinking water caused lymphoid and bone marrow cell depletion and hepatocellular lesions and increased the severity of nephropathy and cardiomyopathy in male and female rats. The lethal effects of 10,000 ppm urethane were slightly exacerbated by 5% ethanol in female rats. Urethane administered in drinking water induced lung inflammation, alveolar and bronchiolar hyperplasia, alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas, nephropathy, cardiomyopathy, lymphoid and bone marrow cell depletion, seminiferous tubule degeneration, and ovarian atrophy and follicular degeneration in mice. In female mice, 5% ethanol appeared to exacerbate ovarian atrophy. Mice administered urethane in 5% ethanol consumed less fluid, and therefore less urethane, than mice receiving urethane in drinking water. Coadministration of urethane and ethanol inhibited the clearance of urethane from plasma. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",Is Urethane mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 or TA1535 or TA1537 strain?,True
1629,"To identify the major mutagen in pyroligneous acid (PA), 10 wood and 10 bamboo pyroligneous acids were examined using the Ames test in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA98. Subsequently, the mutagenic dicarbonyl compounds (DCs), glyoxal, methylglyoxal (MG), and diacetyl in PA were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography, and the mutagenic contribution ratios for each DC were calculated relative to the mutagenicity of PA. Eighteen samples were positive for mutagens and showed the strongest mutagenicity in TA100 in the absence of S9 mix. MG had the highest mutagenic contribution ratio, and its presence was strongly correlated with the specific mutagenicity of PA. These data indicate that MG is the major mutagen in PA.

1630,"The mutagenicity of a series of nine alpha-dicarbonyl compounds against S. typhimurium strain TA100 was studied using the Ames test (standard plate incorporation assay) without preincubation. Acetylbenzoyl, sodium glyoxylate and camphorquinone were not mutagenic. The following sequence of activities (in revertants per mumol of free dicarbonyl added) was obtained: glyoxal greater than methylglyoxal greater than phenylglyoxal much greater than 1,2-cyclohexanedione much greater than diacetyl greater than 3,4-hexanedione. These compounds can be grouped in three series: aldehydes, ketones and enolizable ketones (1,2-cyclohexanedione). In each of the two first groups the mutagenic activity decreases when the size of the substituent increases. No relation was found between the mutagenicity and the molecular electronic and/or resonance parameters. The low or non-existent activity of some of the chemicals studied is discussed. A relation between the mutagenic activities and the polarographic reduction potentials and, consequently, the structures of the mutagens was found.",Is methylglyoxal mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1631,"The mutagenic activity of methylglyoxal (MG) was assayed in vitro in human lymphocytes [induction of chromosomal aberrations (CAs), sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and micronuclei] both in the presence and in the absence of metabolic activation (S9 mix). The Ames/microsome test was performed with the Salmonella typhimurium strains considered more responsive (TA102 and TA104). Positive results were obtained for all the genetic endpoints analysed. In human lymphocytes the activity of MG is decreased by the presence of S9 mix. In the in vivo studies, the metaphase analysis in the ileum and duodenum cells of mice treated per os with MG (400 and 600 mg/kg body wt) gave negative results for CA induction, while only a weak increase of SCE in duodenum cells at the higher dose was obtained. Dimethylhydrazine (25 mg/kg body wt), as positive control, was clearly active in inducing both CAs and SCEs in the same intestinal tissues.",Is methylglyoxal mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True
1632,"Nine coffee preparations, four caffeinated instant brands, three caffeinated drip coffees, and two decaffeinated coffees, one of which was an instant brand, were evaluated for mutagenicity by the Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA100, TA102, and TA104. All the coffees contained direct-acting mutagens, which reverted the three strains. The inclusion of a rat microsomal enzyme preparation reduced the mutagenic response of the three strains in the presence of some of the coffee samples. Both glyoxal and methylglyoxal, 1,2-dicarbonyls found in the coffees were mutagenic. The concentration of glyoxal, methyglyoxal, diacetyl, and guiacol were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Caffeine, furfural, and 5-methylfurfural concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Although lower concentrations of methyglyoxal were found in the drip caffeinated coffees, the mutagenic potency of these preparations was higher than the instant coffees on a weight basis especially when TA104 was the indicator organism. Our findings agree with those of other workers who have shown that carbonyl compounds, which were present in all the brands tested, are partially responsible for the mutagenic response of coffee but that additional mutagens are also present.",Is methylglyoxal mutagenic for TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1633,"The genotoxic potential of methylglyoxal (MG) was studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7 and in Salmonella typhimurium TA97 and TA102 in the presence and in the absence of metabolic activation system (S9 fraction) prepared from mouse liver induced with beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF) and sodium phenobarbital (PB). The in vivo effects on the hepatic microsomal mixed function mono-oxygenase system induced by MG were studied in untreated, beta-NF or PB pre-treated mice. MG was a direct-acting mutagen in S. typhimurium TA97 and TA102 when tested up to a maximum concentration of 0.47 mg/plate. Mitotic gene conversion was also induced by MG in the yeast S. cerevisiae D7. A weak but significant effect on reverse point mutation was also found in S. cerevisiae. Genetic activity was lower in the presence of S9 fraction in yeast test. In the in vivo studies, MG (at the total dose of 600 mg/kg) was shown to increase the aminopyrine N-demethylase (APD) and p-nitroanisole O-demethylase (p-NAD) activities in uninduced mice. Cytochrome P-450 content (cyt P-450) and ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase activity (ECD) were also weakly enhanced by MG treatment. In contrast, no significant changes in mono-oxygenase activities were seen in beta-NF- or PB-treated mice after MG injection.",Is methylglyoxal mutagenic for TA102 strain?,True
1634,"Recently, mutagenic activity on several strains of Salmonella typhimurium has been found in many heat-processed foodstuffs. The previously reported direct-acting mutagenic activity of coffee in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 (Ames assay) was confirmed in our study. In addition to TA100, a mutagenic effect of coffee was also found by using the newly developed strain TA102. The mutagenic activity was abolished by the addition of rat-liver homogenate. 10% S9 mix completely eliminated the mutagenic activity of 30 mg of coffee per plate. The addition of reduced glutathione to active S9 further decreased the mutagenic activity and also reduced the mutagenicity together with inactivated S9. The compound or compounds responsible for this inactivation are heat-labile and seem to be located in the cytosol fraction of the S9. Part of the mutagenicity of coffee was also lost spontaneously upon incubation at temperatures between 0 degrees and 50 degrees C. The loss of activity was dependent on temperature, being more pronounced at 50 degrees C compared to 0 degrees C (at 50 degrees C approximately 50% of the mutagenic activity was lost after 6 h). As anaerobic conditions prevented this loss of mutagenicity almost totally, oxidative processes are probably responsible for the inactivation. The stability of the mutagen was not influenced by incubation at low pH values (pH 1-3), with or without the addition of pepsinogen. The mutagenic properties of methylglyoxal, which to some extent could be responsible for the mutagenic activity of coffee, were compared with those of coffee. Methylglyoxal was strongly mutagenic towards Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA102. Its mutagenic activity was partially inactivated by the addition of 10% S9. Glyoxalase I and II together with reduced glutathione abolished the mutagenic activity of methylglyoxal but reduced the mutagenicity of coffee by only 80%. Since these enzymes occur in mammalian cells, the mutagenic compound(s) of coffee could also be degraded in vivo. This conclusion is supported by the fact that a long-term carcinogenicity study with rats was negative. These results clearly demonstrate that the effects observed in vitro do not necessarily also occur in vivo, but that in vitro experiments may contribute to the understanding of fundamental mechanisms of chemical carcinogenesis.",Is methylglyoxal mutagenic for TA100 or TA102 strain?,True
1635,"22 arylmethane dyes which have been used as food colours, commercial dyes, laboratory stains and pH indicators were tested in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity assay. 8 mutagenic dyes were identified, including 5 food colours and 3 common laboratory strains; none of the 11 indicator dyes tested was mutagenic. The commercial and laboratory dyes Methyl Violet 2B C.I. 42535 and Crystal Violet C.I. 42555 were mutagenic in base-pair substitution mutation detector strain TA1535 in the absence of metabolic activation.

1638,"Kojic acid (KA), a natural substance produced by fungi or bacteria, such as Aspergillus, Penicillium or Acetobacter spp, is contained in traditional Japanese fermented foods and is used as a dermatological skin-lightening agent. High concentrations of KA (>or=1000 microg/plate) were mutagenic in S. typhimurium strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA102 and E. coli WP2uvrA, but not in TA 1537. An Ames test following the ""treat and plate"" protocol was negative. A chromosome aberration test in V79 cells following a robust protocol showed only a marginal increase in chromosome aberrations at cytotoxic concentrations after prolonged (>or=18 h) exposure. No genotoxic activity was observed for hprt mutations either in mouse lymphoma or V79 cells, or in in vitro micronucleus tests in human keratinocytes or hepatocytes. All in vivo genotoxicity studies on KA doses were negative, including mouse bone marrow micronucleus tests after single or multiple doses, an in vivo/in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test, or a study in the liver of the transgenic Muta(TM) Mouse. On the basis of pharmacokinetic studies in rats and in vitro absorption studies in human skin, the systemic exposure of KA in man following its topical application is estimated to be in the range of 0.03-0.06 mg/kg/day. Comparing these values with the NOAEL in oral subchronic animal studies (250 mg/kg/day), the calculated margin of safety would be 4200- to 8900-fold. Comparing human exposure with the doses that were negative for micronuclei, UDS and gene mutations in vivo, the margins of safety are 16000 to 26000-fold.

1639,"Halonitromethanes (HNMs) are a recently identified class of disinfection by-products (DPBs) in drinking water that are mutagenic in Salmonella and potent inducers of DNA strand breaks in mammalian cells. Here we compared the mutagenic potencies of the HNMs to those of their halomethane (HM) homologues by testing all nine HNMs and seven of the nine HMs (minus bromomethane and chloromethane) under the same conditions (the pre-incubation assay) in Salmonella TA100 +/- S9. We also determined the mutation spectra for several DBPs. In the presence of S9, all nine HNMs, but only three HMs, dibromomethane (DBM), dichloromethane (DCM), and bromochloromethane (BCM), were mutagenic. Only two DBPs of each class were mutagenic in the absence of S9. The HNMs were generally more potent mutagens than their HM homologues, and the brominated forms of both classes of DBPs were more mutagenic and cytotoxic than their chlorinated homologues. The HNMs were at least 10 times more cytotoxic than the HMs, and the cytotoxicity rankings in the presence of S9 were similar for the HNMs and the HMs. The addition of a nitro-group to BCM did not change the mutation spectra significantly, with both homologues inducing primarily (55-58%) GC --> AT transitions. The greater cytotoxic and mutagenic activities of the HNMs relative to the HMs are likely due to the greater intrinsic reactivity conferred by the nitro-group. Energy calculations predicted increased reactivity with increasing bromination and greater reactivity of the HNMs versus the HMs (Elumo values were approximately 20 kcal/mol lower for the HNMs compared to their HM homologues). Given that the HNMs also are potent genotoxins in mammalian cells [Environ. Sci. Technol. 38 (2004) 62] and are more mutagenic and 10x more cytotoxic in Salmonella than the HMs, whose levels are regulated in drinking water, further study of their occurrence and potential health effects is warranted.",Is BCM mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1640,"Bavistan is known to be a potent inducer of chromosome malsegregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The influence of different factors on the induction of chromosome malsegregation in S. cerevisiae D61.M was investigated. With both standard protocols used (16 h overnight incubation and cold treatment protocol) bavistan, in a concentration range of 2.5-20 micrograms/ml, induced malsegregants to the same extent. The frequencies of malsegregants obtained were not influenced by the plating volume used on selective medium. Induction of malsegregants and toxicity became stronger with increasing supplementation of the incubation medium with yeast extract and peptone. The effects of bavistan on chromosome malsegregation were more pronounced at 28 degrees C--the normal temperature for yeast growth--as compared to 33 and 37 degrees C. A study of the time dependence of the induction of chromosome loss showed that malsegregants can already be detected after 8 h and 1.5 h (second incubation period) using the incubation protocols without and with cold treatment, respectively. To clarify whether a selection towards malsegregants occurs, the growth of mixed cultures of red, cycloheximide-sensitive cells and white, cycloheximide-resistant, leucine-auxotrophic cells prepared at different ratios was compared. A strong selection towards red cells and against the malsegregants was observed. In addition, bavistan was tested for genotoxic activity in Salmonella (Ames test) and in yeast S. cerevisiae D7. No mutagenic activity was detected using S. cerevisiae D7 (gene conversion, reverse mutation, mitotic crossing-over) with and without rat-liver S9.

1641,"Nitrosamine by-products in drinking water are designated as probable human carcinogens by the IARC, but the health effects of simultaneous exposure to multiple nitrosamines in drinking water remain unknown. Genotoxicity assays were used to assess the effects of both individual and mixed nitrosamines in finished drinking water produced by a large water treatment plant in Shanghai, China. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were measured at 1, 10-, 100- and 1000-fold actual concentrations by the Ames test, Comet assay, γ-H2AX assay, and the cytokinesis-block micronuclei assay; oxidative stress and the Nrf2 pathway were also assessed. Nitrosamines detected in drinking water included NDMA (36.45 ng/L), NDPA (44.68 ng/L), and NEMA (37.27 ng/L). Treatment with a mixture of the three nitrosamines at 1000-fold actual drinking-water concentration induced a doubling of revertants in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100, DNA and chromosome damage in HepG2 cells, while 1-1000-fold concentrations of compounds applied singly lacked these effects. Treatment with 100- and 1000-fold concentrations increased ROS, GSH, and MDA and decreased SOD activity. Thus, nitrosamine mixtures showed greater genotoxic potential than that of the individual compounds. N-Acetylcysteine protected against the nitrosamine-induced chromosome damage, and Nrf2 pathway activation suggested that oxidative stress played pivotal roles in the genotoxic property of the nitrosamine mixtures.",Is NDPA mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True
1642,"Development of mutagenicity of five N-nitrosamines (N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine (NDPA), N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) and N-nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPhA)) was investigated during oxidative processes involving UV-photolysis, ozone and OH radicals. The mutagenicity was detected by the Ames test with 3 different strains, TA98, TAMix and YG7108, a strain which is sensitive for N-nitrosamines, in presence and absence of metabolic activation (S9). UV photolysis of mutagenic N-nitrosamines (NDMA, NDEA, NDPA and NPYR) leads to the removal of their specific mutagenic activity as detected in YG7108 in the presence of S9. A formation of mutagens during UV photolysis was detected only in case of NDPhA in the strain TA98. Oxidation products of NDMA, NDEA and NDPhA did not show any significant mutagenicity in the strains used, whereas oxidation of NDPA and NPYR by hydroxyl radicals seems to lead to the formation of direct mutagens (mutagenic in the absence of S9) in YG7108 and TAMix. Oxidation by hydroxyl radicals of N-nitrosamines with chains longer than ethyl can mimic metabolic activation of N-nitrosamines in vivo. ",Is NDPA mutagenic for TA98 strain?,True
1643,"In a previous report we described the ability of cyclohexanol to induce CYP activity. In order to characterize this induction we tested the capacity of liver S9 from rats orally treated with cyclohexanol for 5 days, to activate several carcinogenic nitrosamines into mutagens in the Salmonella typhimurium TA100 test system. Additionally, Western blot analysis of hepatic microsomes from the same treated animals were analysed with specific antibodies against P450 protein families 1A1/A2, 2B1/B2 and 2E1. Cyclohexanol-S9 mixture was more efficient in activating the following nitrosamines: N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodipropylamine (NDPA), N-nitrosomethylpropylamine (NMPA), N-nitrosodibutylamine (NDBA), and N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) into bacterial mutagens than S9 from non-treated animals. The mutagenicity of N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) was not modified in the presence of S9 from cyclohexanol-treated animals. Since the main metabolic pathway leading to the production of mutagenic intermediates of NDMA and NPYR is catalysed by isozyme CYP2E1 and that of NDPA, NMPA and NDBA by CYP2B1/B2, mutagenicity experiments predicted that cyclohexanol induces these two P450 isozyme families. Western blot analysis confirmed the results of the mutagenicity assay, showing an increase in the intensity of CYP2E1 and CYP2B1/B2 protein bands in hepatic microsomes from cyclohexanol treated rats in comparison with non-treated controls. Bacterial mutagenicity tests with specific pro-mutagens were good predictors of the P450 induction properties of cyclohexanol.",Is NDPA mutagenic for TA100 strain?,True

This induction of mutagenesis with norharman was strong for the ortho isomers of every nitro-compound, weak for the para isomers, and was not observed for the meta isomers.",Is 88-72-2 mutagenic for TA98 strain?,False
1645,"Mouriri pusa Gardner and Mouriri elliptica Martius are fruit-bearing plants of the Melastomataceae family, popularly known in Brazil as puçá-preto or jaboticaba-do-cerrado, and they are used in folk medicine for the treatment of gastric ulcers. In this study, we employ the Ames test to assess the mutagenicity of compounds obtained from the leaves of these species. The methanol extract of the M. pusa was mutagenic to the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA97a and TA100, with or without metabolic activation. The methanol extract of M. elliptica induced mutagenic activity in TA98 when metabolized with S9 fraction and TA97a with and without S9, but with lower mutagenicity index (MI) and potencies values than those for M. pusa. Enriched fractions of flavonoids and tannins of M. pusa were also evaluated and they demonstrated positive mutagenicity. The highest values of MI and potency were obtained with the flavonoid fraction, which contains large amounts of quercetin, quercetin glycosides and myricetin. These compounds are probably related to the mutagenicity observed in the Ames test. The dichloromethane extract was not mutagenic in any of the test conditions employed.",Is methanol extract of M. elliptica mutagenic for TA98 or TA100 strain?,True
